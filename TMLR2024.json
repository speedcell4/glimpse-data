    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Searching the vast chemical space for drug-like molecules that bind with a protein pocket is a challenging task in drug discovery. Recently, structure-based generative models have been introduced which promise to be more efficient by learning to generate molecules for any given protein structure. However, since they learn the distribution of a limited protein-ligand complex dataset, structure-based methods do not yet outperform optimization-based methods that generate binding molecules for just one pocket. To overcome limitations on data while leveraging learning across protein targets, we choose to model the reward distribution conditioned on pocket structure, instead of the training data distribution. We design TacoGFN, a novel GFlowNet-based approach for structure-based drug design, which can generate molecules conditioned on any protein pocket structure with probabilities proportional to its affinity and property rewards. In the generative setting for CrossDocked2020 benchmark, TacoGFN attains a state-of-the-art success rate of 56.0% and -8.44 kcal/mol in median Vina Dock score while improving the generation time by multiple orders of magnitude. Fine-tuning TacoGFN further improves the median Vina Dock score to -10.93 kcal/mol and the success rate to 88.8\\%, outperforming all optimization-based methods",

    "abstract": "Discriminative features extracted from the sparse coding model have been shown to perform well for classification. Recent deep learning architectures have further improved reconstruction in inverse problems by considering new dense priors learned from data. We propose a novel dense and sparse coding model that integrates both representation capability and discriminative features. The model studies the problem of recovering a dense vector x and a sparse vector u given measurements of the form y = Ax+Bu. Our first analysis relies on a geometric condition, specifically the minimal angle between the spanning subspaces of matrices A and B, which ensures a unique solution to the model. The second analysis shows that, under some conditions on A and B, a convex program recovers the dense and sparse components. We validate the effectiveness of the model on simulated data and propose a dense and sparse autoencoder (DenSaE) tailored to learning the dictionaries from the dense and sparse model. We demonstrate that (i) DenSaE denoises natural images better than architectures derived from the sparse coding model (Bu), (ii) in the presence of noise, training the biases in the latter amounts to implicitly learning the Ax + Bu model, (iii) A and B capture low- and high-frequency contents, respectively, and (iv) compared to the sparse coding model, DenSaE offers a balance between discriminative power and representation",

Our investigation reveals that we can partially reproduce one of the original three claims and fully substantiate the other two. Additionally, we broaden the application of Graphair from node classification to link prediction across various datasets. Our findings indicate that, while Graphair demonstrates a comparable fairness-accuracy trade-off to baseline models for mixed dyadic-level fairness, it has a superior trade-off for subgroup dyadic-level fairness.

    "abstract": "\\textbf{How can balance be quantified in game settings?} This question is crucial for game designers, especially in player-versus-player (PvP) games, where analyzing the strength relations among predefined team compositions—such as hero combinations in multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) games or decks in card games—is essential for enhancing gameplay and achieving balance. We have developed two advanced measures that extend beyond the simplistic win rate to quantify balance in zero-sum competitive scenarios. These measures are derived from win value estimations, which employ strength rating approximations via the Bradley-Terry model and counter relationship approximations via vector quantization, significantly reducing the computational complexity associated with traditional win value estimations. Throughout the learning process of these models, we identify useful categories of compositions and pinpoint their counter relationships, aligning with the experiences of human players without requiring specific game knowledge. Our methodology hinges on a simple technique to enhance codebook utilization in discrete representation with a deterministic vector quantization process for an extremely small state space. Our framework has been validated in popular online games, including \\textit{Age of Empires II}, \\textit{Hearthstone}, \\textit{Brawl Stars}, and \\textit{League of Legends}. The accuracy of the observed strength relations in these games is comparable to traditional pairwise win value predictions, while also offering a more manageable complexity for analysis. Ultimately, our findings contribute to a deeper understanding of PvP game dynamics and present a methodology that significantly improves game balance evaluation and design",

However, finding a universally applicable measure for these styles poses a challenge. Building on $\\textit{Playstyle Distance}$, the first unsupervised metric to measure playstyle similarity based on game screens and raw actions by identifying comparable states with discrete representations for computing policy distance, we introduce three enhancements to increase accuracy: multiscale analysis with varied state granularity, a perceptual kernel rooted in psychology, and the utilization of the intersection-over-union method for efficient evaluation. These innovations not only advance measurement precision but also offer insights into human cognition of similarity. Across two racing games and seven Atari games, our techniques significantly improve the precision of zero-shot playstyle classification, achieving an accuracy exceeding 90\\% with fewer than 512 observation-action pairs—less than half an episode of these games. Furthermore, our experiments with $\\textit{2048}$ and $\\textit{Go}$ demonstrate the potential of discrete playstyle measures in puzzle and board games. We also develop an algorithm for assessing decision-making diversity using these measures.

We present AdaFlood, a novel flood regularization method that adapts the flood level of each training sample according to the difficulty of the sample. Intuitively, since training samples are not equal in difficulty, the target training loss should be conditioned on the instance. Experiments on datasets covering four diverse input modalities -- text, images, asynchronous event sequences, and tabular -- demonstrate the versatility of AdaFlood across data domains and noise levels",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "The issue of group fairness in machine learning models, where certain sub-populations or groups are favored over others, has been recognized for some time. While many mitigation strategies have been proposed in centralized learning, many of these methods are not directly applicable in federated learning, where data is privately stored on multiple clients. To address this, many proposals try to mitigate bias at the level of clients before aggregation, which we call locally fair training. However, the effectiveness of these approaches is not well understood. In this work, we investigate the theoretical foundation of locally fair training by studying the relationship between global model fairness and local model fairness. Additionally, we prove that for a broad class of fairness metrics, the global model's fairness can be obtained using only summary statistics from local clients. Based on that, we propose a globally fair training algorithm that optimizes the fairness-regularized empirical loss. Real-data experiments demonstrate the promising performance of our proposed approach for enhancing fairness while retaining high accuracy compared to locally fair training methods",

LJL simulates a dissipative process of repulsive and weakly attractive interactions between individual points by considering the nearest neighbor of each point at a given moment in time. This pushes the particles into a potential valley, reaching a well-defined stable configuration that approximates an equidistant sampling after the stabilization process. We apply LJLs to redistribute randomly generated point clouds into a randomized uniform distribution. Moreover, LJLs are embedded in the generation process of point cloud networks by adding them at later stages of the inference process. The improvements in 3D point cloud generation utilizing LJLs are evaluated qualitatively and quantitatively. Finally, we apply LJLs to improve the point distribution of a score-based 3D point cloud denoising network. In general, we demonstrate that LJLs are effective for distribution normalization which can be applied at negligible cost without retraining the given neural network",

The P300 speller is a primary type of BCI system, which allows users to spell words without using a physical keyboard, but instead by capturing and interpreting brain electroencephalogram (EEG) signals under different stimulus presentation paradigms. Traditional non-adaptive presentation paradigms, however, treat each word selection as an isolated event, resulting in a lengthy learning process. To enhance efficiency, we cast the problem as a sequence of best-arm identification tasks within the context of multi-armed bandits, where each task corresponds to the interaction between the user and the system for a single character or word. Leveraging large language models, we utilize the prior knowledge learned from previous tasks to inform and facilitate subsequent tasks. We propose a sequential top-two Thompson sampling algorithm under two scenarios: the fixed-confidence setting and the fixed-budget setting. We study the theoretical property of the proposed algorithm, and demonstrate its substantial empirical improvement through both simulations as well as the data generated from a P300 speller simulator that was built upon the real BCI experiments",

    "abstract": "Dense embedding-based retrieval is widely used for semantic search and ranking. However, conventional two-stage approaches, involving contrastive embedding learning followed by approximate nearest neighbor search (ANNS), can suffer from misalignment between these stages. This mismatch degrades retrieval performance. We propose End-to-end Hierarchical Indexing (EHI), a novel method that directly addresses this issue by jointly optimizing embedding generation and ANNS structure. EHI leverages a dual encoder for embedding queries and documents while simultaneously learning an inverted file index (IVF)-style tree structure. To facilitate the effective learning of this discrete structure, EHI introduces dense path embeddings that encodes the path traversed by queries and documents within the tree. Extensive evaluations on standard benchmarks, including MS MARCO (Dev set) and TREC DL19, demonstrate EHI's superiority over traditional ANNS index. Under the same computational constraints, EHI outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods by +1.45% in MRR@10 on MS MARCO (Dev) and +8.2% in nDCG@10 on TREC DL19, highlighting the benefits of our end-to-end approach",

Despite achieving outstanding performances on tasks with heavy-tail stochastic gradient noise distributions, adaptive federated learning also suffers from the same data heterogeneity issue as standard federated learning: heterogeneous data distribution across the clients can largely deteriorate the convergence of adaptive federated learning. In this paper, we propose a novel adaptive federated learning framework with local gossip averaging to address this issue. Particularly, we introduce a client re-sampling mechanism and peer-to-peer gossip communications between local clients to mitigate the data heterogeneity without requiring additional gradient computation costs. We theoretically prove the fast convergence for our proposed method under non-convex stochastic settings and empirically demonstrate its superior performances over vanilla adaptive federated learning with client sampling. Moreover, we extend our framework to a communication-efficient variant, in which clients are divided into disjoint clusters determined by their connectivity or communication capabilities. We exclusively perform local gossip averaging within these clusters, leading to an enhancement in network communication efficiency for our proposed method",

To answer this question, we propose a novel approach, Discriminative Stable Diffusion (Discffusion), which turns pre-trained text-to-image diffusion models into few-shot discriminative learners. Our approach uses the cross-attention score of a Stable Diffusion model to capture the mutual influence between visual and textual information and fine-tune the model via a new attention-based prompt learning to perform image-text matching.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Model guidance describes the approach of regularizing the explanations of a deep neu- ral network model towards highlighting the correct features to ensure that the model is \"right for the right reasons\". Rao et al. (2023) conducted an in-depth evaluation of ef- fective and efficient model guidance for object classification across various loss functions, attributions methods, models, and 'guidance depths' to study the effectiveness of differ- ent methods. Our work aims to (1) reproduce the main results obtained by Rao et al. (2023), and (2) propose several extensions to their research. We conclude that the major part of the original work is reproducible, with certain minor exceptions, which we discuss in this paper. In our extended work, we point to an issue with the Energy Pointing Game (EPG) metric used for evaluation and propose an extension for increasing its robustness. In addition, we observe the EPG metric's predisposition towards favoring larger bounding boxes, a bias we address by incorporating a corrective penalty term into the original En- ergy loss function. Furthermore, we revisit the feasibility of using segmentation masks in light of the original study's finding that minimal annotated data can significantly boost model performance. Our findings suggests that Energy loss inherently guides models to on-object features without the requirement for segmentation masks. Finally, we explore the role of contextual information in object detection and, contrary to the assumption that focusing solely on object-specific features suffices for accurate classification, our find- ings suggest the importance of contextual cues in certain scenarios.

Crucially, when we further assume a causal structure over these tasks, our approach enables simple maximum marginal likelihood optimization, and suggests potential downstream applications to causal representation learning.

    "abstract": "Inverse graphics -- the task of inverting an image into physical variables that, when rendered, enable reproduction of the observed scene -- is a fundamental challenge in computer vision and graphics. Successfully disentangling an image into its constituent elements, such as the shape, color, and material properties of the objects of the 3D scene that produced it, requires a comprehensive understanding of the environment. This complexity limits the ability of existing carefully engineered approaches to generalize across domains. Inspired by the zero-shot ability of large language models (LLMs) to generalize to novel contexts, we investigate the possibility of leveraging the broad world knowledge encoded in such models to solve inverse-graphics problems. To this end, we propose the Inverse-Graphics Large Language Model (IG-LLM), an inverse-graphics framework centered around an LLM, that autoregressively decodes a visual embedding into a structured, compositional 3D-scene representation. We incorporate a frozen pre-trained visual encoder and a continuous numeric head to enable end-to-end training. Through our investigation, we demonstrate the potential of LLMs to facilitate inverse graphics through next-token prediction, without the application of image-space supervision. Our analysis enables new possibilities for precise spatial reasoning about images that exploit the visual knowledge of LLMs. We release our code and data at https://ig-llm.is.tue.mpg.de/ to ensure the reproducibility of our investigation and to facilitate future research",

    "title": "Path Development Network with Finite-dimensional Lie Group",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Signature, lying at the heart of rough path theory, is a central tool for analysing controlled differential equations driven by irregular paths. Recently it has also found extensive applications in machine learning and data science as a mathematically principled, universal feature that boosts the performance of deep learning-based models in sequential data tasks. It, nevertheless, suffers from the curse of dimensionality when paths are high-dimensional. We propose a novel, trainable path development layer, which exploits representations of sequential data through finite-dimensional Lie groups, thus resulting in dimension reduction. Its backpropagation algorithm is designed via optimization on manifolds. Our proposed layer, analogous to recurrent neural networks (RNN), possesses an explicit, simple recurrent unit that alleviates the gradient issues. Our layer demonstrates its strength in irregular time series modelling. Empirical results on a range of datasets show that the development layer consistently and significantly outperforms signature features on accuracy and dimensionality. The compact hybrid model (stacking one-layer LSTM with the development layer) achieves state-of-the-art against various RNN and continuous time series models. Our layer also enhances the performance of modelling dynamics constrained to Lie groups. Code is available at https://github.com/PDevNet/DevNet.git",

    "title": "Biased Dueling Bandits with Stochastic Delayed Feedback",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "The dueling bandit problem, an essential variation of the traditional multi-armed bandit problem, has become significantly prominent recently due to its broad applications in online advertising, recommendation systems, information retrieval, and more. However, in many real-world applications, the feedback for actions is often subject to unavoidable delays and is not immediately available to the agent. This partially observable issue poses a significant challenge to existing dueling bandit literature, as it significantly affects how quickly and accurately the agent can update their policy on the fly. In this paper, we introduce and examine the biased dueling bandit problem with stochastic delayed feedback, revealing that this new practical problem will delve into a more realistic and intriguing scenario involving a preference bias between the selections. We present two algorithms designed to handle situations involving delay. Our first algorithm, requiring complete delay distribution information, achieves the optimal regret bound for the dueling bandit problem when there is no delay. The second algorithm is tailored for situations where the distribution is unknown, but only the expected value of delay is available. We provide a comprehensive regret analysis for the two proposed algorithms and then evaluate their empirical performance on both synthetic and real datasets",

    "title": "AdaStop: adaptive statistical testing for sound comparisons of Deep RL agents",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Recently, the scientific community has questioned the statistical reproducibility of many empirical results, especially in the field of machine learning. To contribute to the resolution of this reproducibility crisis, we propose a theoretically sound methodology for comparing the performance of a set of algorithms. We exemplify our methodology in Deep Reinforcement Learning (Deep RL). The performance of one execution of a Deep RL algorithm is a random variable. Therefore, several independent executions are needed to evaluate its performance. When comparing algorithms with random performance, a major question concerns the number of executions to perform to ensure that the result of the comparison is theoretically sound. Researchers in Deep RL often use less than 5 independent executions to compare algorithms: we claim that this is not enough in general. Moreover, when comparing more than 2 algorithms at once, we have to use a multiple tests procedure to preserve low error guarantees. We introduce AdaStop, a new statistical test based on multiple group sequential tests. When used to compare algorithms, AdaStop adapts the number of executions to stop as early as possible while ensuring that enough information has been collected to distinguish algorithms that have different score distributions. We prove theoretically that AdaStop has a low probability of making a (family-wise) error. We illustrate the effectiveness of AdaStop in various use-cases, including toy examples and Deep RL algorithms on challenging Mujoco environments. AdaStop is the first statistical test fitted to this sort of comparisons: it is both a significant contribution to statistics, and an important contribution to computational studies performed in reinforcement learning and in other domains",

    "abstract": "Test-time defenses are used to improve the robustness of deep neural networks to adversarial examples during inference. However, existing methods either require an additional trained classifier to detect and correct the adversarial samples, or perform additional complex optimization on the model parameters or the input to adapt to the adversarial samples at test-time, resulting in a significant increase in the inference time compared to the base model. In this work, we propose a novel test-time defense strategy called Robust Feature Inference (RFI) that is easy to integrate with any existing (robust) training procedure without additional test-time computation. Based on the notion of robustness of features that we present, the key idea is to project the trained models to the most robust feature space, thereby reducing the vulnerability to adversarial attacks in non-robust directions. We theoretically characterize the subspace of the eigenspectrum of the feature covariance that is the most robust for a generalized additive model. Our extensive experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, tiny ImageNet and ImageNet datasets for several robustness benchmarks, including the state-of-the-art methods in RobustBench show that RFI improves robustness across adaptive and transfer attacks consistently. We also compare RFI with adaptive test-time defenses to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach",

How do we evaluate the samples these models generate? This work aims to provide an accessible entry point to understanding popular sample-based statistical distances, requiring only foundational knowledge in mathematics and statistics. We focus on four commonly used notions of statistical distances representing different methodologies: Using low-dimensional projections (Sliced-Wasserstein; SW), obtaining a distance using classifiers (Classifier Two-Sample Tests; C2ST), using embeddings through kernels (Maximum Mean Discrepancy; MMD), or neural networks (Fréchet Inception Distance; FID). We highlight the intuition behind each distance and explain their merits, scalability, complexity, and pitfalls. To demonstrate how these distances are used in practice, we evaluate generative models from different scientific domains, namely a model of decision-making and a model generating medical images. We showcase that distinct distances can give different results on similar data. Through this guide, we aim to help researchers to use, interpret, and evaluate statistical distances for generative models in science",

Traditionally, they are constructed through recursive algorithms, where they partition the data at every node in a tree. However, identifying a good partition is challenging, as decision trees optimized for local segments may not yield global generalization. To address this, we introduce MetaTree, a transformer-based model trained via meta-learning to directly produce strong decision trees. Specifically, we fit both greedy decision trees and globally optimized decision trees on a large number of datasets, and train MetaTree to produce only the trees that achieve strong generalization performance. This training enables MetaTree to emulate these algorithms and intelligently adapt its strategy according to the context, thereby achieving superior generalization performance",

    "abstract": "We introduce a novel methodology for identifying adversarial attacks on deepfake detectors using eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI). In an era characterized by digital advancement, deepfakes have emerged as a potent tool, creating a demand for efficient detection systems. However, these systems are frequently targeted by adversarial attacks that inhibit their performance. We address this gap, developing a defensible deepfake detector by leveraging the power of XAI. The proposed methodology uses XAI to generate interpretability maps for a given method, providing explicit visualizations of decision-making factors within the AI models. We subsequently employ a pretrained feature extractor that processes both the input image and its corresponding XAI image. The feature embeddings extracted from this process are then used for training a simple yet effective classifier. Our approach contributes not only to the detection of deepfakes but also enhances the understanding of possible adversarial attacks, pinpointing potential vulnerabilities. Furthermore, this approach does not change the performance of the deepfake detector. The paper demonstrates promising results suggesting a potential pathway for future deepfake detection mechanisms. We believe this study will serve as a valuable contribution to the community, sparking much-needed discourse on safeguarding deepfake detectors",

However, most existing QAT methods require end-to-end training on the entire dataset, which suffers from long training time and high energy costs.

We propose two metrics based on analysis of loss and gradient of quantized weights: error vector score and disagreement score, to quantify the importance of each sample during training. Guided by these two metrics, we proposed a quantization-aware Adaptive Coreset Selection (ACS) method to select the data for the current training epoch. We evaluate our method on various networks (ResNet-18, MobileNetV2, RetinaNet), datasets(CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, ImageNet-1K, COCO), and under different quantization settings. Specifically, our method can achieve an accuracy of 68.39\\% of 4-bit quantized ResNet-18 on the ImageNet-1K dataset with only a 10\\% subset, which has an absolute gain of 4.24\\% compared to the baseline.

Prior work has studied different ways of automatically creating descriptor sets for every class based on prompt templates, ranging from manually engineered templates over templates obtained from a large language model to templates built from random words and characters. Up until now, deriving zero-shot classifiers from the respective encoded class descriptors has remained nearly unchanged, i.e., classify to the class that maximizes cosine similarity between its averaged encoded class descriptors and the image encoding. However, weighing all class descriptors equally can be suboptimal when certain descriptors match visual clues on a given image better than others. In this work, we propose AutoCLIP, a method for auto-tuning zero-shot classifiers. AutoCLIP tunes per-image weights to each prompt template at inference time, based on statistics of class descriptor-image similarities. AutoCLIP is fully unsupervised, has only a minor additional computation overhead, and can be easily implemented in few lines of code. We show that AutoCLIP outperforms baselines across a broad range of vision-language models, datasets, and prompt templates consistently and by up to 3 percent point accuracy",

Through evaluations of fidelity and usefulness metrics, we demonstrate that iHyperTime outperforms current state-of-the-art methods in challenging scenarios that involve long or irregularly sampled time series, while performing on par on regularly sampled data. Furthermore, we showcase iHyperTime fast training speed, comparable to the fastest existing methods for short sequences and significantly superior for longer ones.

While theoretically appealing, they are overwhelmingly inefficient for complex Bayesian models. In this work, we propose sensitivity-aware amortized Bayesian inference (SA-ABI), a multifaceted approach to efficiently integrate sensitivity analyses into simulation-based inference with neural networks. First, we utilize weight sharing to encode the structural similarities between alternative likelihood and prior specifications in the training process with minimal computational overhead. Second, we leverage the rapid inference of neural networks to assess sensitivity to data perturbations and preprocessing steps. In contrast to most other Bayesian approaches, both steps circumvent the costly bottleneck of refitting the model for each choice of likelihood, prior, or data set. Finally, we propose to use deep ensembles to detect sensitivity arising from unreliable approximation (e.g., due to model misspecification). We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in applied modeling problems, ranging from disease outbreak dynamics and global warming thresholds to human decision-making. Our results support sensitivity-aware inference as a default choice for amortized Bayesian workflows, automatically providing modelers with insights into otherwise hidden dimensions",

They are typically pre-trained on data collections whose construction and curation typically require extensive human effort. This manual process has some limitations similar to those encountered in supervised learning, e.g., the crowd-sourced selection of data is costly and time-consuming, preventing scaling the dataset size. In this work, we consider the problem of automatic curation of high-quality datasets for self-supervised pre-training. We posit that such datasets should be large, diverse and balanced, and propose a clustering-based approach for building ones satisfying all these criteria. Our method involves successive and hierarchical applications of $k$-means on a large and diverse data repository to obtain clusters that distribute uniformly among data concepts, followed by a hierarchical, balanced sampling step from these clusters. Extensive experiments on three different data domains including web-based images, satellite images and text show that features trained on our automatically curated datasets outperform those trained on uncurated data while being on par or better than ones trained on manually curated data.

    "abstract": "In decentralized cooperative multi-armed bandits (MAB), each agent observes a distinct stream of rewards, and seeks to exchange information with others to select a sequence of arms so as to minimize its regret. Agents in the cooperative setting can outperform a single agent running a MAB method such as Upper-Confidence Bound (UCB) independently. In this work, we study how to recover such salient behavior when an unknown fraction of the agents can be Byzantine, that is, communicate arbitrarily wrong information in the form of reward mean-estimates or confidence sets. This framework can be used to model attackers in computer networks, instigators of offensive content into recommender systems, or manipulators of financial markets. Our key contribution is the development of a fully decentralized resilient upper confidence bound (UCB) algorithm that fuses an information mixing step among agents with a truncation of inconsistent and extreme values. This truncation step enables us to establish that the performance of each normal agent is no worse than the classic single-agent UCB1 algorithm in terms of regret, and more importantly, the cumulative regret of all normal agents is strictly better than the non-cooperative case, provided that each agent has at least $3f+1$ neighbors where $f$ is the maximum possible Byzantine agents in each agent's neighborhood. Extensions to time-varying neighbor graphs, and minimax lower bounds are further established on the achievable regret. Experiments corroborate the merits of this framework in practice",

Since the variance of the classical stochastic gradient estimator is typically large, which slows down the convergence, we also apply an efficient stochastic variance-reduce proximal gradient method with an importance sampling based ProbAbilistic Gradient Estimator (PAGE). Our analysis shows that the sample complexity can be improved from $O(\\epsilon^{-4})$ to $O(\\epsilon^{-3})$ under additional conditions. Our results on the stochastic (variance-reduced) proximal gradient method match the sample complexity of their most competitive counterparts for discounted Markov decision processes under similar settings.

    "abstract": "Past years have witnessed the fast and thorough development of active learning, a human-in-the-loop semi-supervised learning that helps reduce the burden of expensive data annotation. Diverse techniques have been proposed to improve the efficiency of label acquisition. However, the existing techniques are mostly intractable at scale on massive unlabeled instances. In particular, the query time and model retraining time of large scale image-data models is usually linear or even quadratic in the size of the unlabeled pool set and its dimension. The main reason for this intractability is the iterative need to scan the pool set at least once in order to select the best samples for label annotation. To alleviate this computational burden we propose efficient Diffusion Graph Active Learning (DGAL). DGAL is used on a pre-computed Variational-Auto-Encoders (VAE) latent space to restrict the pool set to a much smaller candidates set. The sub-sample is then used in deep architectures, to reduce the query time, via an additional standard active learning baseline criterion. DGAL demonstrates a query time versus accuracy trade-off that is two or more orders of magnitude acceleration over state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, we demonstrate the important exploration-exploitation trade-off in DGAL that allows the restricted set to capture the most impactful samples for active learning at each iteration",

However, prior work on dataset distillation has focused exclusively on image classification datasets, whereas modern large-scale datasets are primarily in the vision-language space. In this work, we design the first vision-language dataset distillation method, building on the idea of trajectory matching. A key challenge is that vision-language datasets do not have a set of discrete classes. To overcome this, our proposed method jointly distills image-text pairs in a contrastive formulation. Further, we leverage Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) matching to enable more efficient and effective trajectory matching in complex modern vision-language models. Since there are no existing baselines, we compare our distillation approach with three adapted vision-language coreset selection methods. We demonstrate significant improvements on the challenging Flickr30K and COCO retrieval benchmarks: for example, on Flickr30K, the best coreset selection method selecting 1000 image-text pairs for training achieves only 5.6% image-to-text retrieval accuracy (i.e., recall@1); in contrast, our dataset distillation almost doubles that to 9.9% with just 100 training pairs, an order of magnitude fewer",

Prior methods have addressed this challenge by exploring different model architectures and action representations. However, none were able to balance between sample efficiency and robustness against distractors for solving manipulation tasks with a complex action space. We present Constrained-Context Conditional Diffusion Model (C3DM), a diffusion model policy for solving 6-DoF robotic manipulation tasks with robustness to distractions that can learn deployable robot policies from as little as five demonstrations. A key component of C3DM is a \\emph{fixation} step that helps the action denoiser to focus on task-relevant regions around a predicted \\emph{fixation point} while ignoring distractors in the context. We empirically show that C3DM is robust to out-of-distribution distractors, and consistently achieves high success rates on a wide array of tasks, ranging from table-top manipulation to industrial kitting that require varying levels of precision and robustness to distractors",

This is particularly relevant when complex and high-dimensional relationships have to be learned from a limited sample of the data generating distribution, such as in deep learning. It was previously shown that, in these cases, models rely not only on extracting patterns which are helpful for generalisation, but also seem to be required to incorporate some of the training data more or less as is, in a process often termed memorisation. This raises the question: if some memorisation is a requirement for effective learning, what are its privacy implications? In this work we consider a broad range of previous definitions and perspectives on memorisation in ML, discuss their interplay with model generalisation and their implications of these phenomena on data privacy. We then propose a framework to reason over what memorisation means in the context of ML training under the prism of individual sample's influence on the model. Moreover, we systematise methods allowing practitioners to detect the occurrence of memorisation or quantify it and contextualise our findings in a broad range of ML learning settings. Finally, we discuss memorisation in the context of privacy attacks, differential privacy and adversarial actors",

However, ViT's large model sizes and high sample complexity make it difficult to train on resource-constrained edge devices. Split learning (SL) emerges as a viable solution, leveraging server-side resources to train ViTs while utilizing private data from distributed devices. However, SL requires additional information exchange for weight updates between the device and the server, which can be exposed to various attacks on private training data. To mitigate the risk of data breaches in classification tasks, inspired from the CutMix regularization, we propose a novel privacy-preserving SL framework that injects Gaussian noise into smashed data and mixes randomly chosen patches of smashed data across clients, coined DP-CutMixSL. Our analysis demonstrates that DP-CutMixSL is a differentially private (DP) mechanism that strengthens privacy protection against membership inference attacks during forward propagation. Through simulations, we show that DP-CutMixSL improves privacy protection against membership inference attacks, reconstruction attacks, and label inference attacks, while also improving accuracy compared to DP-SL and DP-MixSL",

To further evaluate the attack and defense capabilities of these poisoning methods, we have developed a benchmark — APBench for assessing the efficacy of adversarial poisoning. APBench consists of 9 state-of-the-art availability poisoning attacks, 8 defense algorithms, and 4 conventional data augmentation techniques. We also have set up experiments with varying different poisoning ratios, and evaluated the attacks on multiple datasets and their transferability across model architectures.

To address these issues, we propose a Decentralized Federated Mutual Learning (DFML) framework that is serverless, supports nonrestrictive heterogeneous models, and avoids reliance on additional data. DFML effectively handles model and data heterogeneity through mutual learning, which distills knowledge between clients, and cyclically varying the amount of supervision and distillation signals. Extensive experimental results demonstrate consistent effectiveness of DFML in both convergence speed and global accuracy, outperforming prevalent baselines under various conditions. For example, with the CIFAR-100 dataset and 50 clients, DFML achieves a substantial increase of +17.20% and +19.95% in global accuracy under Independent and Identically Distributed (IID) and non-IID data shifts, respectively",

We demonstrate that kNN-CLIP can adapt to continually growing vocabularies without the need for retraining or large memory costs. kNN-CLIP enables open-vocabulary segmentation methods to expand their vocabularies on any domain with a single pass through the data, while only storing compact embeddings. This approach minimizes both compute and memory costs. kNN-CLIP achieves state-of-the-art performance across large-vocabulary semantic and panoptic segmentation datasets.

    "abstract": "Bayesian optimization algorithms form an important class of methods to minimize functions that are costly to evaluate, which is a very common situation. These algorithms iteratively infer Gaussian processes from past observations of the function and decide where new observations should be made through the maximization of an acquisition criterion. Often, the objective function is defined on a compact set such as in a hyper-rectangle of the $d$-dimensional real space, and the bounds are chosen wide enough so that the optimum is inside the search domain. In this situation, this work provides a way to integrate in the acquisition criterion the \\textit{a priori} information that these functions, once modeled as GP trajectories, should be evaluated at their minima, and not at any point as usual acquisition criteria do. We propose an adaptation of the widely used Expected Improvement acquisition criterion that accounts only for GP trajectories where the first order partial derivatives are zero and the Hessian matrix is positive definite. The new acquisition criterion keeps an analytical, computationally efficient, expression. This new acquisition criterion is found to improve Bayesian optimization on a test bed of functions made of Gaussian process trajectories in low dimension problems. The addition of first and second order derivative information is particularly useful for multimodal functions",

    "abstract": "The extensive need for computational resources poses a significant obstacle to deploying large-scale Deep Neural Networks (DNN) on devices with constrained resources. At the same time, studies have demonstrated that a significant number of these DNN parameters are redundant and extraneous. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach for learning structured sparse neural networks, aimed at bridging the DNN hardware deployment challenges. We develop a novel regularization technique, termed Weighted Group Sparse Envelope Function (WGSEF), generalizing the Sparse Envelop Function (SEF), to select (or nullify) neuron groups, thereby reducing redundancy and enhancing computational efficiency. The method speeds up inference time and aims to reduce memory demand and power consumption, thanks to its adaptability which lets any hardware specify group definitions, such as filters, channels, filter shapes, layer depths, a single parameter (unstructured), etc. The properties of the WGSEF enable the pre-definition of a desired sparsity level to be achieved at the training convergence. In the case of redundant parameters, this approach maintains negligible network accuracy degradation or can even lead to improvements in accuracy. Our method efficiently computes the WGSEF regularizer and its proximal operator, in a worst-case linear complexity relative to the number of group variables. Employing a proximal-gradient-based optimization technique, to train the model, it tackles the non-convex minimization problem incorporating the neural network loss and the WGSEF. Finally, we experiment and illustrate the efficiency of our proposed method in terms of the compression ratio, accuracy, and inference latency",

We focus on the situation when one image is associated with several captions, each caption containing both information shared among all captions and unique information per caption about the scene depicted in the image. In such cases, it is unclear whether contrastive losses are sufficient for learning task-optimal representations that contain all the information provided by the captions or whether the contrastive learning setup encourages the learning of a simple shortcut that minimizes contrastive loss. We introduce synthetic shortcuts for vision-language: a training and evaluation framework where we inject synthetic shortcuts into image-text data. We show that contrastive VLMs trained from scratch or fine-tuned with data containing these synthetic shortcuts mainly learn features that represent the shortcut. Hence, contrastive losses are not sufficient to learn task-optimal representations, i.e., representations that contain all task-relevant information shared between the image and associated captions. We examine two methods to reduce shortcut learning in our training and evaluation framework: (i) latent target decoding and (ii) implicit feature modification. We show empirically that both methods improve performance on the evaluation task, but only partly reduce shortcut learning when training and evaluating with our shortcut learning framework.

We consider ill-posed inverse imaging problems in which one aims for a clean image posterior given incomplete or noisy measurements. Since the measurements do not uniquely determine a true image, a prior is needed to constrain the solution space. Recent work turned score-based diffusion models into principled priors for solving ill-posed imaging problems by appealing to an ODE-based log-probability function. However, evaluating the ODE is computationally inefficient and inhibits posterior estimation of high-dimensional images. Our proposed surrogate prior is based on the evidence lower bound of a score-based diffusion model. We demonstrate the surrogate prior on variational inference for efficient approximate posterior sampling of large images. Compared to the exact prior in previous work, our surrogate accelerates optimization of the variational image distribution by at least two orders of magnitude. We also find that our principled approach gives more accurate posterior estimation than non-variational diffusion-based approaches that involve hyperparameter-tuning at inference. Our work establishes a practical path forward for using score-based diffusion models as general-purpose image priors",

However, training such a model requires reconciling the discrete nature of combinatorial optimization with the gradient-based frameworks used to train neural networks. We study the case where the problem in question is an Integer Linear Program (ILP). We propose applying a three-operator splitting technique, also known as Davis-Yin splitting (DYS), to the quadratically regularized continuous relaxation of the ILP. We prove that the resulting scheme is compatible with the recently introduced Jacobian-free backpropagation (JFB). Our experiments on two representative ILPs: the shortest path problem and the knapsack problem, demonstrate that this combination---DYS on the forward pass, JFB on the backward pass---yields a scheme which scales more effectively to high-dimensional problems than existing schemes",

The uncertainty of DE is usually manifested by the functional inconsistency among the ensemble members, which, yet, originates from unmanageable randomness in the initialization and optimization of neural networks (NNs), and may easily collapse in specific cases. To tackle this issue, we advocate characterizing the functional inconsistency with the empirical covariance of the functions dictated by the ensemble members, and defining a Gaussian process (GP) with it. We perform functional variational inference to tune such a probabilistic model w.r.t. training data and specific prior beliefs. This way, we can explicitly manage the uncertainty of the ensemble of NNs. We further provide strategies to make the training efficient.

    "abstract": "Transfer learning is a powerful technique that enables model training with limited amounts of data, making it crucial in many data-scarce real-world applications. Typically, transfer learning protocols require first to transfer all the feature-extractor layers of a network pre-trained on a data-rich source task, and then to adapt only the task-specific readout layers to a data-poor target task. This workflow is based on two main assumptions: first, the feature maps of the pre-trained model are qualitatively similar to the ones that would have been learned with enough data on the target task; second, the source representations of the last hidden layers are always the most expressive. In this work, we demonstrate that this is not always the case and that the largest performance gain may be achieved when smaller portions of the pre-trained network are transferred. In particular, we perform a set of numerical experiments in a controlled setting, showing how the optimal transfer depth depends non-trivially on the amount of available training data and on the degree of source-target task similarity, and it is often convenient to transfer only the first layers. We then propose a strategy to detect the most promising source task among the available candidates.

To overcome these challenges, we developed the Denoising and Nuclear-Norm Wasserstein Adaptation Network (DNAN). DNAN utilizes the Nuclear-Norm Wasserstein Discrepancy (NWD), which simultaneously achieves domain alignment and class distinction. The NWD is integrated with a denoising mechanism using a variational graph autoencoder, with a theoretical analysis provided for the denoising process. This denoising mechanism aims to address domain shifts in structural patterns between the source and target domains.

    "abstract": "A hybrid model involves the cooperation of an interpretable model and a complex black box. At inference, any input of the hybrid model is assigned to either its interpretable or complex component based on a gating mechanism. The ratio of data samples sent to the interpretable component is referred to as the model transparency. Despite their high potential, Hybrid Interpretable Models remain under-studied in the interpretability/explainability literature. In this paper, we remedy this fact by presenting a thorough investigation of such models from three perspectives: Theory, Taxonomy, and Methods. First, we highlight the potential generalization benefits of sending samples to an interpretable component by deriving a Probably-Approximately-Correct (PAC) generalization bound. This guarantee indicates a sweet spot for optimal transparency, which suggests that redirecting inputs to an interpretable model can act as regularization. Secondly, we provide a general taxonomy for the different ways of training such models: the Post-Black-Box and Pre-Black-Box paradigms. These approaches differ in the order in which the interpretable and complex components are trained. We show where the state-of-the-art Hybrid-Rule-Set and Companion-Rule-List fall in this taxonomy. Thirdly, we implement the two paradigms in a single method: HybridCORELS, which extends the CORELS algorithm to Hybrid Interpretable Modeling. By leveraging CORELS, HybridCORELS provides a certificate of optimality of its interpretable component and precise control over transparency. We finally show empirically that HybridCORELS is competitive with existing approaches and performs just as well as a standalone black box (or even better) while being partly transparent",

    "abstract": "Temporal difference (TD) learning is a policy evaluation in reinforcement learning whose performance can be enhanced by variance reduction methods. Recently, multiple works have sought to fuse TD learning with Stochastic Variance Reduced Gradient (SVRG) method to achieve a geometric rate of convergence. However, the resulting convergence rate is significantly weaker than what is achieved by SVRG in the setting of convex optimization. In this work we utilize a recent interpretation of TD-learning as the splitting of the gradient of an appropriately chosen function, thus simplifying the algorithm and fusing TD with SVRG. Our main result is a geometric convergence bound with predetermined learning rate of $1/8$, which is identical to the convergence bound available for SVRG in the convex setting. Our theoretical findings are supported by a set of experiments",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Temporal-difference (TD) learning is widely regarded as one of the most popular algorithms in reinforcement learning (RL). Despite its widespread use, it has only been recently that researchers have begun to actively study its finite time behavior, including the finite time bound on mean squared error and sample complexity. On the empirical side, experience replay has been a key ingredient in the success of deep RL algorithms, but its theoretical effects on RL have yet to be fully understood. In this paper, we present a simple decomposition of the Markovian noise terms and provide finite-time error bounds for tabular on-policy TD-learning with experience replay. Specifically, under the Markovian observation model, we demonstrate that for both the averaged iterate and final iterate cases, the error term induced by a constant step-size can be effectively controlled by the size of the replay buffer and the mini-batch sampled from the experience replay buffer",

    "title": "The Cold Posterior Effect Indicates Underfitting, and Cold Posteriors Represent a Fully Bayesian Method to Mitigate It",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "The cold posterior effect (CPE) (Wenzel et al., 2020) in Bayesian deep learning shows that, for posteriors with a temperature $T<1$, the resulting posterior predictive could have better performance than the Bayesian posterior ($T=1$). As the Bayesian posterior is known to be optimal under perfect model specification, many recent works have studied the presence of CPE as a model misspecification problem, arising from the prior and/or from the likelihood. In this work, we provide a more nuanced understanding of CPE as we show that misspecification leads to CPE only when the resulting Bayesian posterior underfits. In fact, we theoretically show that if there is no underfitting, there is no CPE. Furthermore, we show that these tempered posteriors with $T < 1$ are indeed proper Bayesian posteriors with a different combination of likelihoods and priors parameterized by $T$. This observation validates the adjustment of the temperature hyperparameter $T$ as a straightforward approach to mitigate underfitting in the Bayesian posterior. In essence, we show that by fine-tuning the temperature $T$ we implicitly utilize alternative Bayesian posteriors, albeit with less misspecified likelihood and prior distributions.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "In the pursuit of effectively modeling real-world joint multimodal signals, learning to learn multiple Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) jointly has gained attention to overcome data scarcity and enhance fitting speed. However, predominant methods based on multi- modal encoders often underperform due to their reliance on direct data-to-parameter map- ping functions, bypassing the optimization steps necessary for capturing the complexities of real-world signals. To address this gap, we propose Multimodal Iterative Adaptation (MIA), a novel framework that combines the strengths of multimodal fusion with optimization-based meta-learning. The key idea is to enhance the learning of INRs by facilitating exchange of cross-modal knowledge among learners during the iterative optimization processes, improv- ing generalization and enabling a more nuanced adaptation to complex signals. To achieve this, we introduce State Fusion Transformers (SFTs), an attention-based meta-learner de- signed to operate in the backward pass of the learners, aggregating learning states, capturing cross-modal relationships, and predicting enhanced parameter updates for the learners. Our extensive evaluation in various real-world multimodal signal regression setups shows that MIA outperforms existing baselines in both generalization and memorization performances.

Our main results are the (computation and sample) efficient algorithms that exploit asymptotic behaviors of exponential sums to effectively average out the noise effect while preventing the information to be estimated from vanishing. In particular, the novel use of the Weyl sum, a variant of exponential sums, allows us to extract spectrum information for linear systems.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Machine learning models for text classification often excel on in-distribution (ID) data but struggle with unseen out-of-distribution (OOD) inputs. Most techniques for improving OOD robustness are not applicable to settings where the model is effectively a black box, such as when the weights are frozen, retraining is costly, or the model is leveraged via an API. Test-time augmentation (TTA) is a simple post-hoc technique for improving robustness that sidesteps black-box constraints by aggregating predictions across multiple augmentations of the test input. TTA has seen limited use in NLP due to the challenge of generating effective natural language augmentations. In this work, we propose LLM-TTA, which uses LLM-generated augmentations as TTA's augmentation function. LLM-TTA outperforms conventional augmentation functions across sentiment, toxicity, and news classification tasks for BERT and T5 models, with BERT's OOD robustness improving by an average of 4.48 percentage points without regressing average ID performance. We explore selectively augmenting inputs based on prediction entropy to reduce the rate of expensive LLM augmentations, allowing us to maintain performance gains while reducing the average number of generated augmentations by 57.74\\%. LLM-TTA is agnostic to the task model architecture, does not require OOD labels, and is effective across low and high-resource settings",

We show the existence of an optimal policy on the action robust MDPs with probabilistic policy execution uncertainty and provide the action robust Bellman optimality equation for its solution.

Our results highlight that action-robust RL shares the same sample complexity barriers as standard RL, ensuring robust performance without additional complexity costs.

Notably, prior latent variable models for point clouds lack a one-to-one correspondence between input and output points. Instead, they rely on optimizing Chamfer distances, a metric that lacks a normalized distributional counterpart, rendering it unsuitable for probabilistic modeling. We replace the explicit minimization of Chamfer distances with a suitable encoder, increasing computational efficiency while simplifying the probabilistic extension. This allows for straightforward application in various tasks, including mesh generation, shape completion, and representation learning.

    "title": "The Survival Bandit Problem",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "In this paper, we introduce and study a new variant of the multi-armed bandit problem (MAB), called the survival bandit problem (S-MAB). While in both problems, the objective is to maximize the so-called cumulative reward, in this new variant, the procedure is interrupted if the cumulative reward falls below a preset threshold. This simple yet unexplored extension of the MAB follows from many practical applications. For example, when testing two medicines against each other on voluntary patients, people's lives and health are at stake, and it is necessary to be able to interrupt experiments if serious side effects occur or if the disease syndromes are not dissipated by the treatment. From a theoretical perspective, the S-MAB is the first variant of the MAB where the procedure may or may not be interrupted. We start by formalizing the S-MAB and we define its objective as the minimization of the so-called survival regret, which naturally generalizes the regret of the MAB. Then, we show that the objective of the S-MAB is considerably more difficult than the MAB, in the sense that contrary to the MAB, no policy can achieve a reasonably small (i.e., sublinear) survival regret. Instead, we minimize the survival regret in the sense of Pareto, i.e., we seek a policy whose cumulative reward cannot be improved for some problem instance without being sacrificed for another one. For that purpose, we identify two key components in the survival regret: the regret given no ruin (which corresponds to the regret in the MAB), and the probability that the procedure is interrupted, called the probability of ruin. We derive a lower bound on the probability of ruin, as well as policies whose probability of ruin matches the lower bound. Finally, based on a doubling trick on those policies, we derive a policy which minimizes the survival regret in the sense of Pareto, providing an answer to the open problem by Perotto et al.

The development of effective algorithms, the tuning of solvers, and the training of machine learning models for MILP resolution all hinge on access to extensive, diverse, and representative data.

We present DIG-MILP, a deep generative framework adept at extracting deep-level structural features from highly limited MILP data and producing instances that closely mirror the target data. Notably, by leveraging the MILP duality, DIG-MILP guarantees a correct and complete generation space as well as ensures the boundedness and feasibility of the generated instances. Our empirical study highlights the novelty and quality of the instances generated by DIG-MILP through two distinct downstream tasks: (S1) Data sharing, where solver solution times correlate highly positive between original and DIG-MILP-generated instances, allowing data sharing for solver tuning without publishing the original data; (S2) Data Augmentation, wherein the DIG-MILP-generated instances bolster the generalization performance of machine learning models tasked with resolving MILP problems",

Based on this realization we propose computing only these unique entries at $\\mathcal{O}(NM)$ costs. Further, we develop two theorems that prescribe sufficient conditions for the complexity reduction to hold generally for a wide range of other approximate GP models, such as the Variational Fourier features approach. The two theorems do this with no assumptions on the data and no additional approximations of the GP models themselves.

From an analysis of Llama-2 7B applied to multistep reasoning over fictional ontologies, we demonstrate that LLMs deploy multiple parallel pathways of answer generation for step-by-step reasoning. These parallel pathways provide sequential answers from the input question context as well as the generated CoT. We observe a functional rift in the middle layers of the LLM. Token representations in the initial half remain strongly biased towards the pretraining prior, with the in-context prior taking over in the later half. This internal phase shift manifests in different functional components: attention heads that write the answer token appear in the later half, attention heads that move information along ontological relationships appear in the initial half, and so on.

Such models are trained to extract features $X_{\\text{inv}}$ where the conditional distribution $Y \\mid X_{\\text{inv}}$ of the label given the extracted features does not change across environments. Invariant models are also supposed to generalize to shifts in the marginal distribution $p(X_{\\text{inv}})$ of the extracted features $X_{\\text{inv}}$, a type of shift we call an invariant covariate shift. However, we show that proposed methods for learning invariant models underperform under invariant covariate shift, either failing to learn invariant models---even for data generated from simple and well-studied linear-Gaussian models---or having poor finite-sample performance. To alleviate these problems, we propose weighted risk invariance (WRI). Our framework is based on imposing invariance of the loss across environments subject to appropriate reweightings of the training examples. We show that WRI provably learns invariant models, i.e. discards spurious correlations, in linear-Gaussian settings. We propose a practical algorithm to implement WRI by learning the density $p(X_{\\text{inv}})$ and the model parameters simultaneously, and we demonstrate empirically that WRI outperforms previous invariant learning methods under invariant covariate shift",

Although local data is not exposed directly, privacy concerns nonetheless exist as clients' sensitive information can be inferred from intermediate computations. Moreover, such information leakage accumulates substantially over time as the same data is repeatedly used during the iterative learning process. As a result, it can be particularly difficult to balance the privacy-accuracy trade-off when designing privacy-preserving FL algorithms. This paper introduces Upcycled-FL, a simple yet effective strategy that applies first-order approximation at every even round of model update. Under this strategy, half of the FL updates incur no information leakage and require much less computational and transmission costs. We first conduct the theoretical analysis on the convergence (rate) of Upcycled-FL and then apply two perturbation mechanisms to preserve privacy. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world data show that the Upcycled-FL strategy can be adapted to many existing FL frameworks and consistently improve the privacy-accuracy trade-off",

Structural recursion is central to the programming language and formal mathematics tasks where symbolic tools currently excel beyond neural models, such as inferring semantic relations between datatypes and emulating program behavior. We introduce a general framework that nicely connects the abstract concepts of structural recursion in the programming language domain to concrete sequence modeling problems and learned models' behavior. The framework includes a representation that captures the general \\textit{syntax} of structural recursion, coupled with two different frameworks for understanding their \\textit{semantics}---one that is more natural from a programming languages perspective and one that helps bridge that perspective with a mechanistic understanding of the underlying transformer architecture. With our framework as a powerful conceptual tool, we identify different issues under various set-ups. The models trained to emulate recursive computations cannot fully capture the recursion yet instead fit short-cut algorithms and thus cannot solve certain edge cases that are under-represented in the training distribution. In addition, it is difficult for state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) to mine recursive rules from in-context demonstrations.

    "abstract": "The inability to linearly classify $\\texttt{XOR}$ has motivated much of deep learning. We revisit this age-old problem and show that $\\textit{linear}$ classification of $\\texttt{XOR}$ is indeed possible. Instead of separating data between halfspaces, we propose a slightly different paradigm, $\\texttt{equality separation}$, that adapts the SVM objective to distinguish data within or outside the margin. Our classifier can then be integrated into neural network pipelines with a smooth approximation. From its properties, we intuit that equality separation is suitable for anomaly detection. To formalize this notion, we introduce $\\textit{closing numbers}$, a quantitative measure on the capacity for classifiers to form closed decision regions for anomaly detection. Springboarding from this theoretical connection between binary classification and anomaly detection, we test our hypothesis on supervised anomaly detection experiments, showing that equality separation can detect both seen and unseen anomalies",

Our approach uses a 1-Wasserstein metric over the tree metric space as an objective function, which enables us to simultaneously learn a data-driven label hierarchy and perform (semi-)supervised learning.

The primary difficulty is fine-tuning the model after pruning, which is needed to recover the lost performance caused by dropping weights. Recent approaches have either ignored fine-tuning entirely, focusing on efficient pruning criteria, or attempted layer-wise weight updates, preserving the behavior of each layer. However, even layer-wise weight updates can be costly for LLMs, and previous works have resorted to various approximations. In our paper, we propose a fast and effective weight update algorithm for pruned layers based on the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM).

GRSSLFS employs an approach for constructing a basis for the feature space, which includes those features with the highest variance. The objective function of GRSSLFS is then developed based on a self-representation framework that combines subspace learning and matrix factorization of the basis matrix. Moreover, these basis features are incorporated into a manifold learning term to preserve the geometrical structure of the underlying data. We provide an effectiveness and performance evaluation on several widely-used benchmark datasets.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Learning to defer (L2D) aims to improve human-AI collaboration systems by learning how to defer decisions to humans when they are more likely to be correct than an ML classifier. Existing research in L2D overlooks key real-world aspects that impede its practical adoption, namely: i) neglecting cost-sensitive scenarios, where type I and type II errors have different costs; ii) requiring concurrent human predictions for every instance of the training dataset; and iii) not dealing with human work-capacity constraints. To address these issues, we propose the \\textit{deferral under cost and capacity constraints framework} (DeCCaF). DeCCaF is a novel L2D approach, employing supervised learning to model the probability of human error under less restrictive data requirements (only one expert prediction per instance) and using constraint programming to globally minimize the error cost, subject to workload limitations. We test DeCCaF in a series of cost-sensitive fraud detection scenarios with different teams of 9 synthetic fraud analysts, with individual work-capacity constraints. The results demonstrate that our approach performs significantly better than the baselines in a wide array of scenarios, achieving an average $8.4\\%$ reduction in the misclassification cost.

This study touches upon one major open theoretical problem in machine learning--why deep neural networks trained with GD methods are efficient in many practical applications? While the solution of this problem is still beyond the reach of general nonlinear deep neural networks, extensive efforts have been invested in studying relevant questions for deep linear neural networks, and many interesting results have been reported to date. For example, recent results on loss landscape show that even though the loss function of deep linear neural networks is non-convex, every local minimizer is also a global minimizer. We focus on the trajectory of GD when applied to deep linear networks and demonstrate that, with appropriate initialization and sufficient width of the hidden layers, the GD trajectory closely matches that of the corresponding convex optimization problem. This result holds regardless of the depth of the network, providing insight into the efficiency of GD in the training of deep neural networks. Furthermore, we show that the GD trajectory for an overparameterized deep linear network automatically avoids bad saddle points",

For many problems, the sparsifying dictionary is not directly given, nor its existence can be assumed. Besides, the sensing matrix can change across different scenarios. Addressing these issues requires solving a sparse representation learning problem, namely dictionary learning, taking into account the epistemic uncertainty of the learned dictionaries and, finally, jointly learning sparse representations and reconstructions under varying sensing matrix conditions. We address both concerns by proposing a variant of the LISTA architecture. First, we introduce Augmented Dictionary Learning ISTA (A-DLISTA), which incorporates an augmentation module to adapt parameters to the current measurement setup. Then, we propose to learn a distribution over dictionaries via a variational approach, dubbed Variational Learning ISTA (VLISTA). VLISTA exploits A-DLISTA as the likelihood model and approximates a posterior distribution over the dictionaries as part of an unfolded LISTA-based recovery algorithm. As a result, VLISTA provides a probabilistic way to jointly learn the dictionary distribution and the reconstruction algorithm with varying sensing matrices.

Quantifying the extent to which a given representation is disentangled is not straightforward; multiple metrics have been proposed.

First, we use hypothetical toy examples to demonstrate the failure modes we identify for existing metrics. Then, we show that similar situations occur in practice. Finally, we validate our metrics on the downstream task of compositional generalization. We measure the performance of six existing disentanglement models on this downstream compositional generalization task, and show that performance is (a) generally quite poor, (b) correlated, to varying degrees, with most disentanglement metrics, and (c) most strongly correlated with our newly proposed metrics.

Recent work has shown that molecular graph generation using recurrent neural networks (RNNs) is advantageous compared to traditional generative approaches which require converting continuous latent representations into graphs. One issue which arises when treating graph generation as sequential generation is the arbitrary order of the sequence which results from a particular choice of graph flattening method: in the chemistry setting, molecular graphs commonly have multiple SMILES strings corresponding to the same molecule. Inspired by the use case of molecular graph generation, we propose using RNNs, taking into account the non-sequential nature of graphs by adding an Orderless Regularization (OLR) term that encourages the hidden state of the recurrent model to be invariant to different valid orderings present under the training distribution. We demonstrate that sequential molecular graph generation models benefit from our proposed regularization scheme, especially when data is scarce. Our findings contribute to the growing body of research on graph generation and provide a valuable tool for various applications requiring the synthesis of realistic and diverse graph structures",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Under-bagging (UB), which combines under-sampling and bagging, is a popular ensemble learning method for training classifiers on an imbalanced data. Using bagging to reduce the increased variance caused by the reduction in sample size due to under-sampling is a natural approach. However, it has recently been pointed out that in generalized linear models, naive bagging, which does not consider the class imbalance structure, and ridge regularization can produce the same results. Therefore, it is not obvious whether it is better to use UB, which requires an increased computational cost proportional to the number of under-sampled data sets, when training linear models. Given such a situation, in this study, we heuristically derive a sharp asymptotics of UB and use it to compare with several other standard methods for learning from imbalanced data, in the scenario where a linear classifier is trained from a two-component mixture data. The methods compared include the under-sampling (US) method, which trains a model using a single realization of the subsampled data, and the simple weighting (SW) method, which trains a model with a weighted loss on the entire data. It is shown that the performance of UB is improved by increasing the size of the majority class while keeping the size of the minority fixed, even though the class imbalance can be large, especially when the size of the minority class is small. This is in contrast to US, whose performance is almost independent of the majority class size. In this sense, bagging and simple regularization differ as methods to reduce the variance increased by under-sampling. On the other hand, the performance of SW with the optimal weighting coefficients is almost equal to UB, indicating that the combination of reweighting and regularization may be similar to UB",

    "abstract": "Machine learning models are susceptible to a variety of attacks that can erode trust, including attacks against the privacy of training data, and adversarial examples that jeopardize model accuracy. Differential privacy and certified robustness are effective frameworks for combating these two threats respectively, as they each provide future-proof guarantees. However, we show that standard differentially private model training is insufficient for providing strong certified robustness guarantees. Indeed, combining differential privacy and certified robustness in a single system is non-trivial, leading previous works to introduce complex training schemes that lack flexibility. In this work, we present DP-CERT, a simple and effective method that achieves both privacy and robustness guarantees simultaneously by integrating randomized smoothing into standard differentially private model training. Compared to the leading prior work, DP-CERT gives up to a 2.5x increase in certified accuracy for the same differential privacy guarantee on CIFAR10. Through in-depth per-sample metric analysis, we find that larger certifiable radii correlate with smaller local Lipschitz constants, and show that DP-CERT effectively reduces Lipschitz constants compared to other differentially private training methods.

Existing approaches involve retraining model or multiple finetuning steps for each deletion request, often constrained by computational limits and restricted data access. In this work, we introduce a novel class unlearning algorithm designed to strategically eliminate specific classes from the learned model. Our algorithm first estimates the Retain and the Forget Spaces using Singular Value Decomposition on the layerwise activations for a small subset of samples from the retain and unlearn classes, respectively. We then compute the shared information between these spaces and remove it from the forget space to isolate class-discriminatory feature space. Finally, we obtain the unlearned model by updating the weights to suppress the class discriminatory features from the activation spaces. We demonstrate our algorithm's efficacy on ImageNet using a Vision Transformer with only ~1.5% drop in retain accuracy compared to the original model while maintaining under 1% accuracy on the unlearned class samples. Furthermore, our algorithm exhibits competitive unlearning performance and resilience against Membership Inference Attacks (MIA). Compared to baselines, it achieves an average accuracy improvement of 1.38% on the ImageNet dataset while requiring up to 10x fewer samples for unlearning. Additionally, under stronger MIA attacks on the CIFAR-100 dataset using a ResNet18 architecture, our approach outperforms the best baseline by 1.8%",

    "abstract": "Following the great success in natural language processing, transformer-based models have emerged as the competitive model against the convolutional neural networks in computer vision. Vision transformer (ViT) and its subsequent variants have exhibited promising performance in tasks such as image classification, object detection and semantic segmentation. The core of vision transformers is the self-attention mechanism, which models the long-range dependency of different tokens. Conventionally, the attention matrix in self-attention is calculated by the scaled dot-product of \\textit{query} (Q) and \\textit{key} (K). In this case, the attention weight would depend on norm of Q and K as well as the angle between them. In this paper, we propose a new attention mechanism named angular self-attention, which replaces the scaled dot-product operation with the angular function in order to effectively model the relationship between tokens. In particular, we propose two forms of functions: quadratic and cosine functions, for our angular self-attention. Based on angular self-attention, we design a new vision transformer architecture called dual-windowed angular vision transformer (\\textbf{DWAViT}). DWAViT is a hierarchical-structured model characterized by the angular self-attention and a new local window mechanism. We evaluate DWAViT on multiple computer vision benchmarks, including image classification on ImageNet-1K, object detection on COCO, and semantic segmentation on ADE20K.

We focus on a fundamental decision-making framework with natural language as input, which is the one of contextual bandits, where the context information consists of text. As a representative of the approaches with no uncertainty estimation, we consider an LLM agent with a greedy policy, which picks the action corresponding to the largest predicted reward. We compare this baseline to LLM agents that make active use of uncertainty estimation by integrating the uncertainty in a Thompson Sampling policy. We employ different techniques for uncertainty estimation, such as Laplace Approximation, Dropout, and Epinets. We empirically show on real-world data that the greedy policy performs worse than the Thompson Sampling policies.

    "abstract": "Perturbation robustness evaluates the vulnerabilities of models, arising from a variety of perturbations, such as data corruptions and adversarial attacks. Understanding the mechanisms of perturbation robustness is critical for global interpretability. We present a model-agnostic, global mechanistic interpretability method to interpret the perturbation robustness of image models. This research is motivated by two key aspects. First, previous global interpretability works, in tandem with robustness benchmarks, *eg.* mean corruption error (mCE), are not designed to directly interpret the mechanisms of perturbation robustness within image models. Second, we notice that the spectral signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) of perturbed natural images exponentially decay over the frequency. This power-law-like decay implies that: Low-frequency signals are generally more robust than high-frequency signals -- yet high classification accuracy can not be achieved by low-frequency signals alone. By applying Shapley value theory, our method axiomatically quantifies the predictive powers of robust features and non-robust features within an information theory framework. Our method, dubbed as **I-ASIDE** (**I**mage **A**xiomatic **S**pectral **I**mportance **D**ecomposition **E**xplanation), provides a unique insight into model robustness mechanisms.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Pairwise comparison of graphs is key to many applications in Machine Learning ranging from clustering, kernel-based classification/regression and more recently supervised graph prediction. Distances between graphs usually rely on informative representations of these structured objects such as bag of substructures or other graph embeddings. A recently popular solution consists in representing graphs as metric measure spaces, allowing to successfully leverage Optimal Transport, which provides meaningful distances allowing to compare them, namely the Gromov-Wasserstein distance and its variant the Fused Gromov-Wasserstein that applies on node attributed graphs. However, this family of distances overlooks edge attributes, which are essential for many structured objects. In this work, we introduce an extension of the Fused Gromov-Wasserstein distance for comparing graphs whose both nodes and edges have features. We propose novel algorithms for distance and barycenter computation. We present a range of studies that illustrate the properties of the proposed distance and empirically demonstrate its effectiveness in supervised graph prediction tasks",

    "title": "Mini-Batch Optimization of Contrastive Loss",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Contrastive learning has gained significant attention as a pre-training method for self-supervised learning due to its ability to leverage large amounts of unlabeled data. A contrastive loss function ensures that embeddings of positive sample pairs (e.g., from the same class or different views of the same data) are similar, while embeddings of negative pairs are dissimilar. However, practical constraints such as large memory requirements make it infeasible to consider all possible positive and negative pairs, leading to the use of mini-batches. In this paper, we investigate the theoretical aspects of mini-batch optimization in contrastive learning with the InfoNCE loss. We show that mini-batch optimization is equivalent to full-batch optimization if and only if all $\\binom{N}{B}$ mini-batches are selected, while sub-optimality may arise when examining only a subset. We then demonstrate that utilizing high-loss mini-batches can speed up SGD convergence and propose a spectral clustering-based approach for identifying these high-loss mini-batches. Our experimental results validate our theoretical findings and demonstrate that our proposed algorithm outperforms vanilla SGD, providing a better understanding of mini-batch optimization in contrastive learning",

    "abstract": "Protein design often begins with the knowledge of a desired function from a motif which motif-scaffolding aims to construct a functional protein around. Recently, generative models have achieved breakthrough success in designing scaffolds for a range of motifs. However, generated scaffolds tend to lack structural diversity, which can hinder success in wet-lab validation. In this work, we extend FrameFlow, an SE(3) flow matching model for protein backbone generation, to perform motif-scaffolding with two complementary approaches. The first is motif amortization, in which FrameFlow is trained with the motif as input using a data augmentation strategy. The second is motif guidance, which performs scaffolding using an estimate of the conditional score from FrameFlow without additional training. On a benchmark of 24 biologically meaningful motifs, we show our method achieves 2.5 times more designable and unique motif-scaffolds compared to state-of-the-art.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Many machine learning applications, such as feature selection, recommendation, and social advertising, require the joint optimization of the global utility and the representativeness for different groups of items or users. To meet such requirements, we propose a novel multi-objective combinatorial optimization problem called Submodular Maximization with Fair Representation (SMFR), which selects subsets from a ground set, subject to a knapsack or matroid constraint, to maximize a submodular (utility) function $f$ as well as a set of $d$ submodular (representativeness) functions $g_1, \\dots, g_d$. We show that the maximization of $f$ might conflict with the maximization of $g_1, \\dots, g_d$, so that no single solution can optimize all these objectives at the same time. Therefore, we propose a Pareto optimization approach to SMFR, which finds a set of solutions to approximate all Pareto-optimal solutions with different trade-offs between the objectives. Our method converts an instance of SMFR into several submodular cover instances by adjusting the weights of the objective functions; then it computes a set of solutions by running the greedy algorithm on each submodular cover instance. We prove that our method provides approximation guarantees for SMFR under knapsack or matroid constraints. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of SMFR and our proposed approach in two real-world problems: maximum coverage and recommendation",

    "abstract": "Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) is an important paradigm for learning representations from unlabelled data, and SSL with neural networks has been highly successful in practice. However current theoretical analysis of SSL is mostly restricted to generalisation error bounds. In contrast, learning dynamics often provide a precise characterisation of the behaviour of neural networks based models but, so far, are mainly known in supervised settings. In this paper, we study the learning dynamics of SSL models, specifically representations obtained by minimising contrastive and non-contrastive losses. We show that a naive extension of the dymanics of multivariate regression to SSL leads to learning trivial scalar representations that demonstrates dimension collapse in SSL. Consequently, we formulate SSL objectives with orthogonality constraints on the weights, and derive the exact (network width independent) learning dynamics of the SSL models trained using gradient descent on the Grassmannian manifold. We also argue that the infinite width approximation of SSL models significantly deviate from the neural tangent kernel approximations of supervised models. We numerically illustrate the validity of our theoretical findings, and discuss how the presented results provide a framework for further theoretical analysis of contrastive and non-contrastive SSL",

While prior research established quantifiable links between model output and training data in diverse settings, interpreting diffusion model outputs in relation to training samples remains underexplored. In particular, diffusion models operate over a sequence of timesteps instead of instantaneous input-output relationships in previous contexts, posing a significant challenge to extend existing frameworks to diffusion models directly. Notably, we present Diffusion-TracIn that incorporates this temporal dynamics and observe that samples' loss gradient norms are highly dependent on timestep. This trend leads to a prominent bias in influence estimation, and is particularly severe for samples trained on large-norm-inducing timesteps, causing them to be generally influential. To mitigate this bias, we introduce Diffusion-ReTrac as a re-normalized adaptation that retrieves training samples targeted to the test sample of interest, enabling a localized measurement of influence and considerably more intuitive visualization.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Federated learning (FL) has demonstrated great potential in revolutionizing distributed machine learning, and tremendous efforts have been made to extend it beyond the original focus on supervised learning. Among many directions, federated contextual bandits (FCB), a pivotal integration of FL and sequential decision-making, has garnered significant attention in recent years. Despite substantial progress, existing FCB approaches have largely employed their tailored FL components, often deviating from the canonical FL framework. Consequently, even renowned algorithms like FedAvg remain under-utilized in FCB, let alone other FL advancements. Motivated by this disconnection, this work takes one step towards building a tighter relationship between the canonical FL study and the investigations on FCB. In particular, a novel FCB design, termed FedIGW, is proposed to leverage a regression-based CB algorithm, i.e., inverse gap weighting. Compared with existing FCB approaches, the proposed FedIGW design can better harness the entire spectrum of FL innovations, which is concretely reflected as (1) flexible incorporation of (both existing and forthcoming) FL protocols; (2) modularized plug-in of FL analyses in performance guarantees; (3) seamless integration of FL appendages (such as personalization, robustness, and privacy).

To address this issue, we introduce a new masked multi-prediction (MMP) approach that produces multiple likely normal outcomes, and show both theoretically and experimentally that it improves normality learning and leads to a better anomaly detection performance. In addition, we observed that normality can be characterized from multiple aspects, depending on the types of anomalies to be detected. Therefore, we propose an adaptation (MMP-AMS) of our approach to cover multiple aspects of normality such as appearance, motion, semantics and location. Since we model each aspect separately, our approach has the advantage of being interpretable and modular, as we can select only a subset of normality aspects.

With the advancement of foundation models, CL research has pivoted from the initial learning-from-scratch paradigm towards utilizing generic features from large-scale pre-training. However, existing approaches to CL with pre-trained models primarily focus on separating class-specific features from the final representation layer and neglect the potential of intermediate representations to capture low- and mid-level features, which are more invariant to domain shifts. In this work, we propose LayUP, a new prototype-based approach to CL that leverages second-order feature statistics from multiple intermediate layers of a pre-trained network. Our method is conceptually simple, does not require access to prior data, and works out of the box with any foundation model. LayUP surpasses the state of the art in four of the seven class-incremental learning benchmarks, all three domain-incremental learning benchmarks and in six of the seven online continual learning benchmarks, while significantly reducing memory and computational requirements compared to existing baselines.

Combining neural ODEs with traditional RNN models has provided the best representation for irregular time series. However, ODEs-based models typically require the trajectory of hidden states to be defined based on either the initial observed value or the most recent observation, raising questions about their effectiveness when dealing with longer sequences and extended time intervals. In this article, we explore the behaviour of the ODEs-based models in the context of time series data with varying degrees of sparsity. We introduce SeqLink, an innovative neural architecture designed to enhance the robustness of sequence representation. Unlike traditional approaches that solely rely on the hidden state generated from the last observed value, SeqLink leverages ODE latent representations derived from multiple data samples, enabling it to generate robust data representations regardless of sequence length or data sparsity level. The core concept behind our model is the definition of hidden states for the unobserved values based on the relationships between samples (links between sequences). Through extensive experiments on partially observed synthetic and real-world datasets, we demonstrate that SeqLink improves the modelling of intermittent time series, consistently outperforming state-of-the-art approaches",

To mitigate this, we propose a simple yet efficient cross-model framework to leverage on the unlabeled samples achieving significant gain in model performance. Specifically, we employ a semi-supervised prompt learning approach which makes the learned prompts invariant to the different views of a given unlabeled sample. The multiple views are obtained using different augmentations on the images as well as by varying the lengths of visual and text prompts attached to these samples. Experimenting with this simple yet surprisingly effective approach over a large number of benchmark datasets, we observe a considerable improvement in the quality of soft prompts thereby making an immense gain in image classification performance.

Given these properties, they are a natural fit for _active learning_ (AL), which aims to maximize labeling efficiency.

In this work, we evaluate how foundation models influence three critical components of effective AL, namely, 1) initial labeled pool selection, 2) ensuring diverse sampling, and 3) the trade-off between representative and uncertainty sampling. We systematically study how the robust representations of foundation models (DINOv2, OpenCLIP) challenge existing findings in active learning. Our observations inform the principled construction of a new simple and elegant AL strategy that balances uncertainty estimated via dropout with sample diversity. We extensively test our strategy on many challenging image classification benchmarks, including natural images as well as out-of-domain biomedical images that are relatively understudied in the AL literature.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Decentralized learning enables serverless training of deep neural networks (DNNs) in a distributed manner on multiple nodes. One of the key challenges with decentralized learning is heterogeneity in the data distribution across the nodes. Data heterogeneity results in slow and unstable global convergence and therefore poor generalization performance. In this paper, we propose In-Distribution Knowledge Distillation (IDKD) to address the challenge of heterogeneous data distribution. The goal of IDKD is to homogenize the data distribution across the nodes. While such data homogenization can be achieved by exchanging data among the nodes sacrificing privacy, IDKD achieves the same objective using a common public dataset across nodes without breaking the privacy constraint. This public dataset is different from the training dataset and is used to distill the knowledge from each node and communicate it to its neighbors through the generated labels. With traditional knowledge distillation, the generalization of the distilled model is reduced due to misalignment between the private and public data distribution. Thus, we introduce an Out-of-Distribution (OoD) detector at each node to label a subset of the public dataset that maps close to the local training data distribution. Our experiments on multiple image classification datasets and graph topologies show that the proposed IDKD scheme is more effective than traditional knowledge distillation and achieves state-of-the-art generalization performance on heterogeneously distributed data with minimal communication overhead",

These scores encompass a wide range of techniques that leverage the self-confidence of deep learning models and the anomalous behavior of features in the latent space. Not surprisingly, combining such a varied population using simple statistics proves inadequate. To overcome this challenge, we propose a quantile normalization to map these scores into p-values, effectively framing the problem into a multi-variate hypothesis test. Then, we combine these tests using established meta-analysis tools, resulting in a more effective detector with consolidated decision boundaries. Furthermore, we create a probabilistic interpretable criterion by mapping the final statistics into a distribution with known parameters. Through empirical investigation, we explore different types of shifts, each exerting varying degrees of impact on data. Our results demonstrate that our approach significantly improves overall robustness and performance across diverse OOD detection scenarios.

    "abstract": "In this paper, we address the problem of capturing graph directionality using transformers. Most existing graph transformers typically capture distances between graph nodes and do not take edge direction into account. This is a limiting assumption since many graph applications need to exploit sophisticated relationships in graph data, such as time, causality, or generic dependency constraints. We introduce a novel graph transformer architecture that explicitly takes into account the directionality between connected graph nodes. To achieve this, we make use of dual encodings to represent both potential roles, i.e., source or target, of each pair of vertices linked by a directed edge. These encodings are learned by leveraging the latent adjacency information extracted from a directional attention module, localized with $k$-hop neighborhood information. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real graph datasets show that our approach can have significant accuracy gains over previous graph transformer (GT) and graph neural network (GNN) approaches, providing state-of-the-art (SOTA) results on inherently directed graphs",

However, IRL is computationally expensive when applied to large populations of demonstrators, as existing IRL algorithms require solving a separate reinforcement learning (RL) problem for each individual. We propose a new IRL approach that relies on contextual RL, where an optimal policy is learned for multiple contexts. We first learn a contextual policy that provides the RL solution directly for a parametric family of reward functions, and then re-use it for IRL on each individual within the population. We motivate our method within the scenario of AI-driven playtesting of videogames, and focus on an interpretable family of reward functions. We evaluate the method on a navigation task and the battle arena game Derk, where it successfully recovers distinct player reward preferences from a simulated population and provides substantial time savings compared to a solid baseline of adversarial IRL",

    "abstract": "Recent research on time-series self-supervised models shows great promise in learning semantic representations. However, it has been limited to small-scale datasets, e.g., thousands of temporal sequences. In this work, we make key technical contributions that are tailored to the numerical properties of time-series data and allow the model to scale to large datasets, e.g., millions of temporal sequences. We adopt the Transformer architecture by first partitioning the input into non-overlapping windows. Each window is then characterized by its normalized shape and two scalar values denoting the mean and standard deviation within each window. To embed scalar values that may possess arbitrary numerical amplitudes to high-dimensional vectors, we propose a numerically multi-scaled embedding module enumerating all possible numerical scales for the scalars. The model undergoes pretraining with a simple contrastive objective on a large-scale dataset over a million sequences collected by merging existing public data. We study its transfer performance on a number of univariate and multivariate classification tasks, few shot learning, unsupervised clustering and anomaly detection benchmarks. Our method exhibits remarkable improvement against previous pretraining approaches and establishes the new state of the art, even compared with domain-specific non-learning-based methods",

    "abstract": "Vision-language models have in short time been established as powerful networks, demonstrating strong performance on a wide range of downstream tasks. A key factor behind their success is the learning of a joint embedding space where pairs of images and textual descriptions are contrastively aligned. Recent work has explored the geometry of the joint embedding space, finding that hyperbolic embeddings provide a compelling alternative to the commonly used Euclidean embeddings. Specifically, hyperbolic embeddings yield improved zero-shot generalization, better visual recognition, and more consistent semantic interpretations. In this paper, we conduct a deeper study into the hyperbolic embeddings and find that they open new doors for vision-language models. In particular, we find that hyperbolic vision-language models provide spatial awareness that Euclidean vision-language models lack, are better capable of dealing with ambiguity, and effectively discriminate between distributions.

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) present an intriguing avenue for exploration in the field of formal theorem proving. Nevertheless, their full potential, particularly concerning the mitigation of hallucinations and refinement through prover error messages, remains an area that has yet to be thoroughly investigated. To enhance the effectiveness of LLMs in the field, we introduce the Lyra, a new framework that employs two distinct correction mechanisms: Tool Correction (TC) and Conjecture Correction (CC). To implement Tool Correction in the post-processing of formal proofs, we leverage prior knowledge to utilize predefined prover tools (e.g., Sledgehammer) for guiding the replacement of incorrect tools. Tool Correction significantly contributes to mitigating hallucinations, thereby improving the overall accuracy of the proof. In addition, we introduce Conjecture Correction, an error feedback mechanism designed to interact with prover to refine formal proof conjectures with prover error messages. Compared to the previous refinement framework, the proposed Conjecture Correction refines generation with instruction but does not collect paired (generation, error & refinement) prompts. Our method has achieved state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on both miniF2F validation (48.0% → 55.3%) and test (45.5% → 51.2%). We also present 3 IMO problems solved by Lyra.

    "abstract": "Transfer learning is a powerful technique for knowledge-sharing between different tasks. Recent work has found that the representations of models with certain invariances, such as to adversarial input perturbations, achieve higher performance on downstream tasks. These findings suggest that invariance may be an important property in the context of transfer learning. However, the relationship of invariance with transfer performance is not fully understood yet and a number of questions remain. For instance, how important is invariance compared to other factors of the pretraining task? How transferable is learned invariance? In this work, we systematically investigate the importance of representational invariance for transfer learning, as well as how it interacts with other parameters during pretraining. To do so, we introduce a family of synthetic datasets that allow us to precisely control factors of variation both in training and test data. Using these datasets, we a) show that for learning representations with high transfer performance, invariance to the right transformations is as, or often more, important than most other factors such as the number of training samples, the model architecture and the identity of the pretraining classes, b) show conditions under which invariance can harm the ability to transfer representations and c) explore how transferable invariance is between tasks.

We outline the challenge posed by its non-convex objective and data heterogeneity in the federated framework. To tackle these challenges, we adopt a new perspective by studying the structures of local solutions in k-means and propose a one-shot algorithm called FeCA (Federated Centroid Aggregation). FeCA adaptively refines local solutions on clients, then aggregates these refined client solutions to recover the global solution of the entire dataset in a single round. We empirically demonstrate the robustness of FeCA under various federated scenarios on both synthetic and real-world data.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Sparse basis recovery is a classical and important statistical learning problem when the number of model dimensions $p$ is much larger than the number of samples $n$. However, there has been little work that studies sparse basis recovery in the Federated Learning (FL) setting, where the client data's differential privacy (DP) must also be simultaneously protected. In particular, the performance guarantees of existing DP-FL algorithms (such as DP-SGD) will degrade significantly when $p \\gg n$, and thus, they will fail to learn the true underlying sparse model accurately. In this work, we develop a new differentially private sparse basis recovery algorithm for the FL setting, called SPriFed-OMP. SPriFed-OMP converts OMP (Orthogonal Matching Pursuit) to the FL setting. Further, it combines SMPC (secure multi-party computation) and DP to ensure that only a small amount of noise needs to be added in order to achieve differential privacy. As a result, SPriFed-OMP can efficiently recover the true sparse basis for a linear model with only $n = \\mathcal{O}(\\sqrt{p})$ samples. We further present an enhanced version of our approach, SPriFed-OMP-GRAD, based on gradient privatization, that improves the performance of SPriFed-OMP. Our theoretical analysis and empirical results demonstrate that both SPriFed-OMP and SPriFed-OMP-GRAD terminate in a small number of steps, and they significantly outperform the previous state-of-the-art DP-FL solutions in terms of the accuracy-privacy trade-off",

To address the problem, we devise the first \\emph{active sequential two-sample testing framework} that not only sequentially but also \\emph{actively queries}. Our test statistic is a likelihood ratio where one likelihood is found by maximization over all class priors, and the other is provided by a probabilistic classification model. The classification model is adaptively updated and used to predict where the (unlabelled) features have a high dependency on labels; labeling the ``high-dependency'' features leads to the increased power of the proposed testing framework. In theory, we provide the proof that our framework produces an \\emph{anytime-valid} $p$-value. In addition, we characterize the proposed framework's gain in testing power by analyzing the mutual information between the feature and label variables in asymptotic and finite-sample scenarios. In practice, we introduce an instantiation of our framework and evaluate it using several experiments; the experiments on the synthetic, MNIST, and application-specific datasets demonstrate that the testing power of the instantiated active sequential test significantly increases while the Type I error is under control",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) are routinely pre-trained on billions of tokens, only to start the process over again once new data becomes available. A much more efficient solution is to continually pre-train these models—saving significant compute compared to re-training. However, the distribution shift induced by new data typically results in degraded performance on previous data or poor adaptation to the new data. In this work, we show that a simple and scalable combination of learning rate (LR) re-warming, LR re-decaying, and replay of previous data is sufficient to match the performance of fully re-training from scratch on all available data, as measured by the final loss and the average score on several language model (LM) evaluation benchmarks. Specifically, we show this for a weak but realistic distribution shift between two commonly used LLM pre-training datasets (English$\\rightarrow$English) and a stronger distribution shift (English$\\rightarrow$German) at the $405$M parameter model scale with large dataset sizes (hundreds of billions of tokens). Selecting the weak but realistic shift for larger-scale experiments, we also find that our continual learning strategies match the re-training baseline for a 10B parameter LLM. Our results demonstrate that autoregressive transformer-based LLMs can be successfully updated via simple and scalable continual learning strategies, matching the re-training baseline using only a fraction of the compute. Finally, inspired by previous work, we propose alternatives to the cosine learning rate schedule that help circumvent forgetting induced by LR re-warming and that are not bound to a fixed token budget",

One critical factor that has been shown to influence systematic generalization is the diversity of training data. However, diversity can be defined in various ways, as data have many factors of variation. A more granular understanding of how different aspects of data diversity affect systematic generalization is lacking. We present new evidence in the problem of Visual Question Answering (VQA) that reveals that the diversity of simple tasks (i.e. tasks formed by a few subtasks and concepts) plays a key role in achieving systematic generalization. This implies that it may not be essential to gather a large and varied number of complex tasks, which could be costly to obtain. We demonstrate that this result is independent of the similarity between the training and testing data and applies to well-known families of neural network architectures for VQA (i.e. monolithic architectures and neural module networks). Additionally, we observe that neural module networks leverage all forms of data diversity we evaluated, while monolithic architectures require more extensive amounts of data to do so.

    "abstract": "Feature removal is a central building block for eXplainable AI (XAI), both for occlusion-based explanations (Shapley values) as well as their evaluation (pixel flipping, PF). However, occlusion strategies can vary significantly from simple mean replacement up to inpainting with state-of-the-art diffusion models. This ambiguity limits the usefulness of occlusion-based approaches. For example, PF benchmarks lead to contradicting rankings. This is amplified by competing PF measures: Features are either removed starting with most influential first (MIF) or least influential first (LIF). This study proposes two complementary perspectives to resolve this disagreement problem. Firstly, we address the common criticism of occlusion-based XAI, that artificial samples lead to unreliable model evaluations. We propose to measure the reliability by the R(eference)-Out-of-Model-Scope (OMS) score. The R-OMS score enables a systematic comparison of occlusion strategies and resolves the disagreement problem by grouping consistent PF rankings. Secondly, we show that the insightfulness of MIF and LIF is conversely dependent on the R-OMS score. To leverage this, we combine the MIF and LIF measures into the symmetric relevance gain (SRG) measure. This breaks the inherent connection to the underlying occlusion strategy and leads to consistent rankings. This resolves the disagreement problem of PF benchmarks, which we verify for a set of 40 different occlusion strategies",

Recent studies suggest and predominantly use LLMs for reference-free evaluation of open-ended question answering. More specifically, they use the recognized \"strongest\" LLM as the evaluator, which conducts pairwise comparisons of candidate models' answers and provides a ranking score. However, this intuitive method has multiple problems, such as bringing in self-enhancement (favoring its own answers) and positional bias. We draw insights and lessons from the educational domain (Cho & MacArthur, 2011; Walsh, 2014) to improve LLM-based evaluations. Specifically, we propose (1) the peer rank (PR) algorithm that takes into account each peer LLM's pairwise preferences of all answer pairs, and outputs a final ranking of models; and (2) peer discussion (PD), where we prompt two LLMs to discuss and try to reach a mutual agreement on the preferences of two answers. We conduct experiments on two benchmark datasets. We find that our approaches achieve higher accuracy and align better with human judgments. Interestingly, PR can induce a relatively accurate self-ranking of models under the anonymous setting, where each model's name is unrevealed.

This work develops a Sequential Importance Sampling framework that approximates the posterior probability density function through weighted samples (or particles), which can be used to find the mean, variance, or higher-order moments of the posterior distribution. We demonstrate that propagating particles, which capture information about the higher-order moments, through the layers of the DL model results in increased robustness to natural and malicious noise (adversarial attacks). The variance computed from these particles effectively quantifies the model's decision uncertainty, demonstrating well-calibrated and accurate predictive confidence",

We show that such architectural biases entail properties that facilitate the manipulation and conditioning of the generative process and allow for regularizing the training procedure. The proposed conditioning framework is implemented by means of a neural network that learns to generate a 2D, multi-channel, layout mask of the objects, which can be used as a soft inductive bias in the downstream generative task. To do so, we leverage both 2D and graph convolutional operators.

    "abstract": "Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection seeks to identify test samples that deviate from the training data, which is critical to ensuring the safety and reliability of machine learning (ML) systems. While a plethora of methods have been developed to detect uni-modal OOD samples, only a few have focused on multi-modal OOD detection. Current contrastive learning-based methods primarily address multi-modal OOD detection in a scenario where an image is not related to the class labels in training data. However, ML systems in the real-world applications may encounter a broader spectrum of anomalies caused by different factors like systematic errors in labeling, environmental changes, and sensor malfunctions. Hence, we propose a new method to be able to simultaneously detect anomalies from multiple different OOD scenarios, arising from fine-grained image features and textual descriptions, instead of large categorical information. To achieve this goal, we propose a general-purpose weakly-supervised OOD detection framework, called WOOD, that combines a binary classifier and a contrastive learning module to reap the benefits of both. In order to better distinguish in-distribution (ID) samples from OOD ones, we employ the Hinge loss to constrain the similarity of their latent representations. Moreover, we devise a new scoring metric that fuses predictions from both the binary classifier and contrastive learning to enhance OOD detection. Extensive experimental results on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed WOOD significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods for multi-modal OOD detection. Importantly, our approach can achieve superior detection performance in a variety of OOD scenarios",

    "title": "Federated TD Learning with Linear Function Approximation under Environmental Heterogeneity",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "We initiate the study of federated reinforcement learning under environmental heterogeneity by considering a policy evaluation problem. Our setup involves $N$ agents interacting with environments that share the same state and action space but differ in their reward functions and state transition kernels. Assuming agents can communicate via a central server, we ask: \\textit{Does exchanging information expedite the process of evaluating a common policy?} To answer this question, we provide the first comprehensive finite-time analysis of a federated temporal difference (TD) learning algorithm with linear function approximation, while accounting for Markovian sampling, heterogeneity in the agents' environments, and multiple local updates to save communication. Our analysis crucially relies on several novel ingredients: (i) deriving perturbation bounds on TD fixed points as a function of the heterogeneity in the agents' underlying Markov decision processes (MDPs); (ii) introducing a virtual MDP to closely approximate the dynamics of the federated TD algorithm; and (iii) using the virtual MDP to make explicit connections to federated optimization. Putting these pieces together, we prove that in a low-heterogeneity regime, exchanging model estimates leads to linear convergence speedups in the number of agents. Our theoretical contribution is significant in that it is the first result of its kind in multi-agent/federated reinforcement learning that complements the numerous analogous results in heterogeneous federated optimization",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Image-to-video (I2V) generation aims to use the initial frame (alongside a text prompt) to create a video sequence. A grand challenge in I2V generation is to maintain visual consistency throughout the video: existing methods often struggle to preserve the integrity of the subject, background, and style from the first frame, as well as ensure a fluid and logical progression within the video narrative. To mitigate these issues, we propose ConsistI2V, a diffusion-based method to enhance visual consistency for I2V generation. Specifically, we introduce (1) spatiotemporal attention over the first frame to maintain spatial and motion consistency, (2) noise initialization from the low-frequency band of the first frame to enhance layout consistency. These two approaches enable ConsistI2V to generate highly consistent videos. We also extend the proposed approaches to show their potential to improve consistency in auto-regressive long video generation and camera motion control. To verify the effectiveness of our method, we propose I2V-Bench, a comprehensive evaluation benchmark for I2V generation. Our automatic and human evaluation results demonstrate the superiority of ConsistI2V over existing methods",

We consider a backward factorization of the variational distributions to analyze the excess risk associated with VAE. Such backward factorizations were recently proposed to perform online variational learning and to obtain upper bounds on the variational estimation error. When independent trajectories of sequences are observed and under strong mixing assumptions on the state space model and on the variational distribution, we provide an oracle inequality explicit in the number of samples and in the length of the observation sequences. We then derive consequences of this theoretical result. In particular, when the data distribution is given by a state space model, we provide an upper bound for the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the data distribution and its estimator and between the variational posterior and the estimated state space posterior distributions. Under classical assumptions, we prove that our results can be applied to Gaussian backward kernels built with dense and recurrent neural networks",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Linear principal component analysis (PCA) learns (semi-)orthogonal transformations by orienting the axes to maximize variance. Consequently, it can only identify orthogonal axes whose variances are clearly distinct, but it cannot identify the subsets of axes whose variances are roughly equal. It cannot eliminate the subspace rotational indeterminacy: it fails to disentangle components with equal variances (eigenvalues), resulting, in each eigen subspace, in randomly rotated axes. In this paper, we propose $\\sigma$-PCA, a method that (1) formulates a unified model for linear and nonlinear PCA, the latter being a special case of linear independent component analysis (ICA), and (2) introduces a missing piece into nonlinear PCA that allows it to eliminate, from the canonical linear PCA solution, the subspace rotational indeterminacy — without whitening the inputs. Whitening, a preprocessing step which converts the inputs into unit-variance inputs, has generally been a prerequisite step for linear ICA methods, which meant that conventional nonlinear PCA could not necessarily preserve the orthogonality of the overall transformation, could not directly reduce dimensionality, and could not intrinsically order by variances. We offer insights on the relationship between linear PCA, nonlinear PCA, and linear ICA — three methods with autoencoder formulations for learning special linear transformations from data, transformations that are (semi-)orthogonal for PCA, and arbitrary unit-variance for ICA. As part of our formulation, nonlinear PCA can be seen as a method that maximizes both variance and statistical independence, lying in the middle between linear PCA and linear ICA, serving as a building block for learning linear transformations that are identifiable",

    "abstract": "Modern deep learning approaches usually utilize modality-specific processing. For example, the most common deep learning approach to image classification involves decoding image file bytes into an RGB tensor which is passed into a neural network. Instead, we investigate modality-independent representation learning by performing classification directly on file bytes, without the need for decoding files at inference time. This enables models to operate on various modalities without any hand-designed, modality-specific processing. Our model, ByteFormer, improves ImageNet Top-1 classification accuracy by $5\\%$ (from $72.2\\%$ to $77.33\\%$) relative to DeIT models of similar size. Compared to Perceiver IO, our model requires absolutely no modality-specific processing at inference time, and uses an order of magnitude fewer parameters at equivalent accuracy on ImageNet. We demonstrate that the same ByteFormer architecture can perform audio classification without modifications or modality-specific preprocessing. We achieve $95.42\\%$ classification accuracy on the Speech Commands V2 dataset (comparable to the state-of-the-art accuracy of $98.7\\%$). Additionally, we demonstrate that ByteFormer can operate jointly on images and audio, handling joint classification without explicit knowledge of the input modality.

In the multi-objective framework, a single algorithm adapting to different user preferences based on a pre-defined reward function and a subjectively defined scalarisation function may be developed. The scalarisation function approximation can be done by fitting a meta-model with information gained from the interaction between the user and the environment or the agent. The interaction requires exact formulation of a constructive feedback, which is also simple for the user to give. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm, Conciliator steering, that leverages priority order and reward transfer to seek optimal user-preferred policies in multi-objective reinforcement learning under expected scalarised returns criterion. We test Conciliator steering on DeepSeaTreasure v1 benchmark problem and demonstrate that it can find user-preferred policies with effortless and simple user-agent interaction and negligible bias, which has not been possible before.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) are gaining increasing attention for their capability to process graphs with rich text attributes, especially in a zero-shot fashion. Recent studies demonstrate that LLMs obtain decent text classification performance on common text-rich graph benchmarks, and the performance can be improved by appending encoded structural information as natural languages into prompts. We aim to understand why the incorporation of structural information inherent in graph data can improve the prediction performance of LLMs. First, we rule out the concern of data leakage by curating a novel leakage-free dataset and conducting a comparative analysis alongside a previously widely-used dataset. Second, as past work usually encodes the ego-graph by describing the graph structure in natural language, we ask the question: do LLMs understand the prompts in graph structures? Third, we investigate why LLMs can improve their performance after incorporating structural information. Our exploration of these questions reveals that (i) there is no substantial evidence that the performance of LLMs is significantly attributed to data leakage; (ii) instead of understanding prompts as graph structures, LLMs tend to process prompts more as contextual paragraphs and (iii) the most efficient elements of the local neighborhood included in the prompt are phrases that are pertinent to the node label, rather than the graph structure",

    "abstract": "Across various sectors such as healthcare, criminal justice, national security, finance, and technology, large-scale machine learning (ML) systems are being deployed to make critical data-driven decisions. Many have asked if we can and should trust these ML systems to be making these decisions. Two critical components are prerequisites for trust in ML systems: interpretability, or the ability to understand why the ML system makes the decisions it does, and fairness, which ensures that ML systems do not exhibit bias against certain individuals or groups. While both interpretability and fairness have garnered substantial attention in the ML literature, methods directly interpreting models in terms of fairness remain limited. This paper considers a popular interpretation for a widely used class of ML models: feature importance scores for decision trees and tree-based models. We introduce a novel Fair Tree Feature Importance Score to assess each feature's impact on fairness or bias in decision trees. Analogous to the mean decrease in impurity for trees, our score quantifies the mean increase (or decrease) in group bias, and extends to interpret tree-based ensembles or surrogates of complex ML systems. Through simulations and real examples on benchmark fairness datasets, we show the validity of our Fair Tree Feature Importance Score, offering meaningful interpretations for both tree-based ensembles and tree-based surrogates of other ML systems",

Consequently, we introduce Todyformer—a novel Transformer-based neural network tailored for dynamic graphs. It unifies the local encoding capacity of Message-Passing Neural Networks (MPNNs) with the global encoding of Transformers through i) a novel patchifying paradigm for dynamic graphs to improve over-squashing, ii) a structure-aware parametric tokenization strategy leveraging MPNNs, iii) a Transformer with temporal positional-encoding to capture long-range dependencies, and iv) an encoding architecture that alternates between local and global contextualization, mitigating over-smoothing in MPNNs. Experimental evaluations on public benchmark datasets demonstrate that Todyformer consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art methods for downstream tasks.

    "abstract": "As various post hoc explanation methods are increasingly being leveraged to explain complex models in high-stakes settings, it becomes critical to develop a deeper understanding of if and when the explanations output by these methods disagree with each other, and how such disagreements are resolved in practice. However, there is little to no research that provides answers to these critical questions. In this work, we introduce and study the disagreement problem in explainable machine learning. More specifically, we formalize the notion of disagreement between explanations, analyze how often such disagreements occur in practice, and how practitioners resolve these disagreements. We first conduct interviews with data scientists to understand what constitutes disagreement between explanations generated by different methods for the same model prediction and introduce a novel quantitative framework to formalize this understanding. We then leverage this framework to carry out a rigorous empirical analysis with four real-world datasets, six state-of-the-art post hoc explanation methods, and six different predictive models, to measure the extent of disagreement between the explanations generated by various popular explanation methods. In addition, we carry out an online user study with data scientists to understand how they resolve the aforementioned disagreements. Our results indicate that (1) state-of-the-art explanation methods often disagree in terms of the explanations they output, and (2) machine learning practitioners often employ ad hoc heuristics when resolving such disagreements. These findings suggest that practitioners may be relying on misleading explanations when making consequential decisions. They also underscore the importance of developing principled frameworks for effectively evaluating and comparing explanations output by various explanation techniques",

In order to explain this seemingly unreasonable effectiveness of FedAvg that contradicts previous theoretical predictions, this paper introduces the client consensus hypothesis: on certain federated datasets, the average of local models updates on clients starting from the optimum is close to zero. We prove that under this hypothesis, data heterogeneity does not exacerbate the convergence of FedAvg. Moreover, we show that this hypothesis holds for a linear regression problem and some naturally heterogeneous datasets such as FEMNIST and StackOverflow.

In CL, historical data are not available during the current stage due to a number of reasons, such as limited storage, GDPR1 data retention policy, to name a few. A few recent works study this problem, however, they overlook the uniqueness of continual graph learning (CGL), compared to well-studied continual image classification: the unavailability of previous training data further poses challenges to inference in CGL, in additional to the well-known catastrophic forgetting problem. While existing works make a strong assumption that full access of historical data is unavailable during training but provided during inference, which potentially contradicts the continual learning paradigm Van de Ven & Tolias (2019), we study continual graph learning without this strong and contradictory assumption. In this case, without being re-inserted into previous training graphs for inference, streaming test nodes are often more sparsely connected, which makes the inference more difficult due to insufficient neighborhood information. In this work, we propose ReplayGNN (ReGNN) to jointly solve the above two challenges without memory buffers: catastrophic forgetting and poor neighbor information during inference. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our model over baseline models and its effectiveness in different cases with different levels of neighbor information available",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Data augmentation is widely used in scenarios where one needs to train a neural network given little labeled data. A common practice of augmentation training is applying a composition of multiple transformations sequentially to the data. Existing augmentation methods such as RandAugment rely on domain expertise to select a list of transformations, while other methods such as AutoAugment formulate an optimization problem over a search space of size $k^d$, which is the number of sequences of length $d$, given a list of $k$ transformation functions. In this paper, we focus on designing efficient algorithms whose running time complexity is much faster than the worst-case complexity of $O(k^d)$, provably. We propose a new algorithm to search for a binary tree-structured composition of $k$ transformations, where each tree node corresponds to one transformation. The binary tree generalizes sequential augmentations, such as the one constructed by SimCLR. Using a top-down, recursive search procedure, our algorithm achieves a runtime complexity of $O(2^d k)$, which is much faster than $O(k^d)$ as $k$ increases above $2$. We apply the algorithm to tackle data distributions with heterogeneous subpopulations, by searching for one tree in each subpopulation, and then learn a weighted combination, leading to a forest of the trees. We validate the proposed algorithms on numerous graph and image data sets, including a multi-label graph classification data set we collected. The data set exhibits significant variations in the sizes of graphs and their average degrees, making it ideal for studying data augmentation. We show that our approach can reduce the computation cost (measured by GPU hours) by 43% over existing augmentation search methods while improving performance by 4.3%. Extensive experiments on contrastive learning also validate the benefit of our approach. The tree structures can be used to interpret the relative importance of each transformation, such as identifying the important transformations on small vs. large graphs",

    "abstract": "Most modern reinforcement learning algorithms optimize a cumulative single-step cost along a trajectory. The optimized motions are often ‘unnatural', representing, for example, behaviors with sudden accelerations that waste energy and lack predictability. In this work, we present a novel paradigm of controlling nonlinear systems via the minimization of the Koopman spectrum cost: a cost over the Koopman operator of the controlled dynamics. This induces a broader class of dynamical behaviors that evolve over stable manifolds such as nonlinear oscillators, closed loops, and smooth movements. We demonstrate that some dynamics characterizations that are not possible with a cumulative cost are feasible in this paradigm, which generalizes the classical eigenstructure and pole assignments to nonlinear decision making. Moreover, we present a sample efficient online learning algorithm for our problem that enjoys a sub-linear regret bound under some structural assumptions",

    "title": "Accurate Neural Network Pruning Requires Rethinking Sparse Optimization",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Obtaining versions of deep neural networks that are both highly-accurate and highly-sparse % is one of the main challenges in the area of model compression, and several high-performance pruning techniques have been investigated by the community. Yet, much less is known about the interaction between sparsity and the standard stochastic optimization techniques used for training sparse networks, and most existing work uses standard dense schedules and hyperparameters for training sparse networks. In this work, we examine the impact of high sparsity on model training using the standard computer vision and natural language processing sparsity benchmarks. We begin by showing that using standard dense training recipes for sparse training is suboptimal, and provide evidence that this results in *under-training*, loosely defined as using a suboptimal number of passes over the training data. We present training recipes for mitigating this issue for both sparse pre-training of vision models (e.g. ResNet50/ImageNet) and sparse fine-tuning of language models (e.g. BERT/GLUE), achieving state-of-the-art results in both settings in the high-sparsity regime, and providing detailed analyses for the difficulty of sparse training in both scenarios. Our work sets a new benchmark in terms of the accuracies that can be achieved under high sparsity, and should inspire further research into improving sparse model training, to reach higher accuracies under high sparsity, but also to do so efficiently",

Despite its broad utility, accurately estimating Granger causality graphs in high-dimensional scenarios with few samples remains a persistent chal- lenge. In response, this study introduces a novel model that leverages prior knowledge in the form of a noisy undirected graph to facilitate the learning of Granger causality graphs, while assuming sparsity. In this study we introduce an optimization problem, we propose to solve it with an alternative minimization approach and we proved the convergence of our fitting algorithm, highlighting its effectiveness. Furthermore, we present experimental results derived from both synthetic and real-world datasets. These results clearly illustrate the advantages of our proposed method over existing alternatives, particularly in situations where few samples are available.

    "abstract": "This study investigates the problem of $K$-armed linear contextual bandits, an instance of the multi-armed bandit problem, under an adversarial corruption. At each round, a decision-maker observes an independent and identically distributed context and then selects an arm based on the context and past observations. After selecting an arm, the decision-maker incurs a loss corresponding to the selected arm. The decision-maker aims to minimize the cumulative loss over the trial. The goal of this study is to develop a strategy that is effective in both stochastic and adversarial environments, with theoretical guarantees. We first formulate the problem by introducing a novel setting of bandits with adversarial corruption, referred to as the contextual adversarial regime with a self-bounding constraint. We assume linear models for the relationship between the loss and the context. Then, we propose a strategy that extends the {\\tt RealLinExp3} by \\citet{Neu2020} and the Follow-The-Regularized-Leader (FTRL).

    "abstract": "In this article, we propose a new paradigm for training spiking neural networks (SNNs), spike accumulation forwarding (SAF). It is known that SNNs are energy-efficient but difficult to train. Consequently, many researchers have proposed various methods to solve this problem, among which online training through time (OTTT) is a method that allows inferring at each time step while suppressing the memory cost. However, to compute efficiently on GPUs, OTTT requires operations with spike trains and weighted summation of spike trains during forwarding. In addition, OTTT has shown a relationship with the Spike Representation, an alternative training method, though theoretical agreement with Spike Representation has yet to be proven. Our proposed method can solve these problems; namely, SAF can halve the number of operations during the forward process, and it can be theoretically proven that SAF is consistent with the Spike Representation and OTTT, respectively. Furthermore, we confirmed the above contents through experiments and showed that it is possible to reduce memory and training time while maintaining accuracy",

    "abstract": "The performance of image classification on well-known benchmarks such as ImageNet is remarkable, but in safety-critical situations, the accuracy often drops significantly under adverse conditions. To counteract these performance drops, we propose a very simple modification to the models: we pre-pend a single, dimension preserving convolutional layer with a large linear kernel whose purpose it is to extract the information that is essential for image classification. We show that our simple modification can increase the robustness against common corruptions significantly, especially for corruptions of high severity. We demonstrate the impact of our channel-specific layers on ImageNet-100 and ImageNette classification tasks and show an increase of up to 30% accuracy on corrupted data in the top1 accuracy. Further, we conduct a set of designed experiments to qualify the conditions for our findings. Our main result is that a data- and network-dependent linear subspace carries the most important classification information (the essential), which our proposed pre-processing layer approximately identifies for most corruptions, and at very low cost",

While recent methods have explored the use of diffusion models, they still require the manual tuning of many hyperparameters for different inverse problems. In this work, we propose a training-free method for solving linear inverse problems by using pretrained flow models, leveraging the simplicity and efficiency of Flow Matching models, using theoretically-justified weighting schemes, and thereby significantly reducing the amount of manual tuning. In particular, we draw inspiration from two main sources: adopting prior gradient correction methods to the flow regime, and a solver scheme based on conditional Optimal Transport paths. As pretrained diffusion models are widely accessible, we also show how to practically adapt diffusion models for our method. Empirically, our approach requires no problem-specific tuning across an extensive suite of noisy linear inverse problems on high-dimensional datasets, ImageNet-64/128 and AFHQ-256, and we observe that our flow-based method for solving inverse problems improves upon closely-related diffusion-based methods in most settings",

However, the calibration produced is often biased due to the binning mechanism. In this work, we propose to learn better-calibrated models via meta-regularization, which has two components: (1) gamma network (gamma-net), a meta learner that outputs sample-wise gamma value (continuous variable) for Focal loss for regularizing the backbone network; (2) smooth expected calibration error (SECE), a Gaussian-kernel based, unbiased, and differentiable surrogate to ECE that enables the smooth optimization of gamma-net. We evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in regularizing neural networks towards improved and unbiased calibration on three computer vision datasets. We empirically demonstrate that: (a) learning sample-wise $\\gamma$ as continuous variables can effectively improve calibration; (b) SECE smoothly optimizes gamma-net towards unbiased and robust calibration with respect to the binning schemes; and (c) the combination of gamma-net and SECE achieves the best calibration performance across various calibration metrics while retaining very competitive predictive performance as compared to multiple recently proposed methods",

    "title": "SpikeGPT: Generative Pre-trained Language Model with Spiking Neural Networks",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "As the size of large language models continue to scale, so does the computational resources required to run them. Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have emerged as an energy-efficient approach to deep learning that leverage sparse and event-driven activations to reduce the computational overhead associated with model inference. While they have become competitive with non-spiking models on many computer vision tasks, SNNs have proven to be more challenging to train. As a result, their performance lags behind modern deep learning, and until now, SNNs have yet to succeed at language generation on large-scale datasets. In this paper, inspired by the Receptance Weighted Key Value (RWKV) language model, we successfully implement `SpikeGPT', a generative language model with binary, event-driven spiking activation units. We train the proposed model on two model variants: 46M and 216M parameters. To the best of our knowledge, SpikeGPT is the largest backpropagation-trained SNN model when released, rendering it suitable for both the generation and comprehension of natural language. We achieve this by modifying the transformer block to replace multi-head self-attention to reduce quadratic computational complexity $\\mathcal{O}(T^2)$ to linear complexity $\\mathcal{O}(T)$ with increasing sequence length. Input tokens are instead streamed in sequentially to our attention mechanism (as with typical SNNs). Our experiments show that SpikeGPT remains competitive with non-spiking models on tested benchmarks, while maintaining 32.2$\\times$ fewer operations when processed on neuromorphic hardware that can leverage sparse, event-driven activations.

Although AD can be incorrect, recent research has shown that it coincides with the derivative almost everywhere, even in the presence of nonsmooth operations. On the other hand, in practice, AD operates with floating-point numbers, and there is, therefore, a need to explore subsets on which AD can be {\\em numerically} incorrect. Recently, \\cite{bertoin2021numerical} empirically studied how the choice of $\\ReLU'(0)$ changes the output of AD and define a numerical bifurcation zone where using $\\ReLU('0) = 0$ differs from using $\\ReLU'(0) = 1$. To extend this for a broader class of nonsmooth operations, we propose a new numerical bifurcation zone (where AD is incorrect over real numbers) and define a compensation zone (where AD is incorrect over floating-point numbers but correct over reals). Using SGD for training, we found that nonsmooth MaxPool Jacobians with lower norms maintain stable and efficient test accuracy, while higher norms can result in instability and decreased performance. We can use batch normalization, Adam-like optimizers, or increase precision to reduce MaxPool Jacobians influence",

In particular, we compute pairwise correlations of neuron activations over 100 million tokens for every neuron pair across five different seeds and find that 1-5\\% of neurons are universal, that is, pairs of neurons which consistently activate on the same inputs. We then study these universal neurons in detail, finding that they usually have clear interpretations and taxonomize them into a small number of neuron families. We conclude by studying patterns in neuron weights to establish several universal functional roles of neurons in simple circuits: deactivating attention heads, changing the entropy of the next token distribution, and predicting the next token to (not) be within a particular set",

In this paper, we propose a data augmentation procedure, the GOLIATH algorithm, based on kernel density estimates and especially dedicated to the problem of imbalanced data. This general approach encompasses two large families of synthetic oversampling: those based on perturbations, such as Gaussian Noise, and those based on interpolations, such as SMOTE. It also provides an explicit form of such machine learning algorithms. New synthetic data generators are deduced. We apply GOLIATH in imbalanced regression combining such generator procedures with a new wild-bootstrap resampling technique for the target values.

In this work, we first show that the performance degradation may also be contributed by the increasing modes of target distributions brought by invariant architectures since 1) the optimal one-step denoising scores are score functions of Gaussian mixtures models (GMMs) whose components center on these modes and 2) learning the scores of GMMs with more components is often harder. Motivated by the analysis, we propose SwinGNN along with a simple yet provable trick that enables permutation-invariant sampling. It benefits from more flexible (non-invariant) architecture designs and permutation-invariant sampling. We further design an efficient 2-WL message passing network using the shifted-window self-attention.

    "abstract": "Binary Neural Networks (BNNs), operating with ultra-low precision weights, incur a significant reduction in storage and compute cost compared to the traditional Deep Neural Networks (DNNs). However, vulnerability of such models against various hardware attacks are yet to be fully unveiled. Towards understanding the potential threat imposed on such highly efficient models, in this paper, we explore a novel adversarial attack paradigm pertaining to BNNs. In specific, we assume the attack to be executed during deployment phase, prior to inference, to achieve malicious intentions, via manipulation of accessible network parameters. We aim to accomplish a graceless degradation in BNN accuracy to a point, where the fully functional network can behave as a random output generator at best, thus subverting the confidence in the system. To this end, we propose an Outlier Gradient-based Evolutionary (OGE) attack, that learns injection of minimal amount of critical bit flips in the pre-trained binary network weights, to introduce classification errors in the inference execution. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that leverages the outlier gradient weights to orchestrate a hardware-based bit-flip attack, that is highly effective against the typically resilient low-quantization BNNs. Exhaustive evaluations on popular image recognition datasets including Fashion-MNIST, CIFAR10, GTSRB, and ImageNet demonstrate that, OGE can drop up to 68.1% of the test images mis-classification, by flipping as little as 150 binary weights, out of 10.3 millions in a BNN architecture",

Our proposed Targeted Negative Training (TNT) results in updates that keep the new distribution close to the original, unlike existing losses for negative signal which push down probability but do not control what the updated distribution will be. In experiments, we demonstrate that TNT yields a better trade-off between reducing unwanted behavior and maintaining model generation behavior than baselines, paving the way towards a modeling paradigm based on iterative training updates that constrain models from generating undesirable outputs while preserving their impressive capabilities",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Machine learning models traditionally assume that training and test data are independently and identically distributed. However, in real-world applications, the test distribution often differs from training. This problem, known as out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization, challenges conventional models. Invariant Risk Minimization (IRM) emerges as a solution that aims to identify invariant features across different environments to enhance OOD robustness. However, IRM's complexity, particularly its bi-level optimization, has led to the development of various approximate methods. Our study investigates these approximate IRM techniques, using the consistency and variance of calibration across environments as metrics to measure the invariance aimed for by IRM. Calibration, which measures the reliability of model prediction, serves as an indicator of whether models effectively capture environment-invariant features by showing how uniformly over-confident the model remains across varied environments. Through a comparative analysis of datasets with distributional shifts, we observe that Information Bottleneck-based IRM achieves consistent calibration across different environments. This observation suggests that information compression techniques, such as IB, are potentially effective in achieving model invariance. Furthermore, our empirical evidence indicates that models exhibiting consistent calibration across environments are also well-calibrated. This demonstrates that invariance and cross-environment calibration are empirically equivalent. Additionally, we underscore the necessity for a systematic approach to evaluating OOD generalization. This approach should move beyond traditional metrics, such as accuracy and F1 scores, which fail to account for the model's degree of over-confidence, and instead focus on the nuanced interplay between accuracy, calibration, and model invariance",

    "abstract": "This paper addresses a cross-modal learning framework, where the objective is to enhance the performance of supervised learning in the primary modality using an unlabeled, unpaired secondary modality. Taking a probabilistic approach for missing information estimation, we show that the extra information contained in the secondary modality can be estimated via Nadaraya-Watson (NW) kernel regression, which can further be expressed as a kernelized cross-attention module (under linear transformation). This expression lays the foundation for introducing The Attention Patch (TAP), a simple neural network add-on that can be trained to allow data-level knowledge transfer from the unlabeled modality. We provide extensive numerical simulations using real-world datasets to show that TAP can provide statistically significant improvement in generalization across different domains and different neural network architectures, making use of seemingly unusable unlabeled cross-modal data",

    "title": "Mildly Constrained Evaluation Policy for Offline Reinforcement Learning",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Offline reinforcement learning (RL) methodologies enforce constraints on the policy to adhere closely to the behavior policy, thereby stabilizing value learning and mitigating the selection of out-of-distribution (OOD) actions during test time. Conventional approaches apply identical constraints for both value learning and test time inference. However, our findings indicate that the constraints suitable for value estimation may in fact be excessively restrictive for action selection during test time. To address this issue, we propose a Mildly Constrained Evaluation Policy (MCEP) for test time inference with a more constrained target policy for value estimation. Since the target policy has been adopted in various prior approaches, MCEP can be seamlessly integrated with them as a plug-in. We instantiate MCEP based on TD3BC (Fujimoto & Gu, 2021), AWAC (Nair et al., 2020) and DQL (Wang et al., 2023) algorithms. The empirical results on D4RL MuJoCo locomotion, high-dimensional humanoid and a set of 16 robotic manipulation tasks show that the MCEP brought significant performance improvement on classic offline RL methods and can further improve SOTA methods.

To tackle those challenges, we develop Deep End-to-end Causal Inference (DECI) framework, a flow based non-linear additive noise model combined with variational inference, which can perform both Bayesian causal discovery and inference. Theoretically, we show that DECI unifies many existing structural equation model (SEM) based causal inference techniques and can recover the ground truth mechanism under standard assumptions. Motivated by the challenges in the real world, we further extend DECI to heterogeneous, mixed-type data with missing values, allowing for both continuous and discrete treatment decisions. Empirically, we conduct extensive experiments (over a thousand) to show the competitive performance of DECI when compared to relevant baselines for both causal discovery and inference with both synthetic and causal machine learning benchmarks across data types and levels of missingness",

Real-world biases can be embedded in the data used to train models, and prior studies have shown that ML models can learn and even amplify these biases. This can result in unfair treatment of individuals based on their inherent characteristics or sensitive attributes such as gender, race, or age. Ensuring fairness is crucial with the increasing use of ML models in high-stakes scenarios and has gained significant attention from researchers in recent years. However, the challenge of ensuring fairness becomes much greater when the assumption of full access to sensitive attributes does not hold. The settings where the hypothesis does not hold include cases where (1) only limited or noisy demographic information is available or (2) demographic information is entirely unobserved due to privacy restrictions. This survey reviews recent research efforts to enforce fairness when sensitive attributes are missing. We propose a taxonomy of existing works and, more importantly, highlight current challenges and future research directions to stimulate research in ML fairness in the setting of missing sensitive attributes",

Multiple recent studies ascribe representations a certain level of innate robustness against forgetting - that they only forget minimally in comparison with forgetting at the output level. We revisit and expand upon the experiments that revealed this difference in forgetting and illustrate the coexistence of two phenomena that affect the quality of continually learned representations: knowledge accumulation and feature forgetting. Taking both aspects into account, we show that, even though forgetting in the representation (i.e. feature forgetting) can be small in absolute terms, when measuring relative to how much was learned during a task, forgetting in the representation tends to be just as catastrophic as forgetting at the output level. Next we show that this feature forgetting is problematic as it substantially slows down the incremental learning of good general representations (i.e. knowledge accumulation). Finally, we study how feature forgetting and knowledge accumulation are affected by different types of continual learning methods",

Our results, validated across binary and multi-class text classification tasks, show that the proposed method's estimates of class separability align with those obtained from supervised methods.

In offline MBO we wish to do so without assuming access to such an oracle during training or validation, with makes evaluation non-straightforward. While an approximation to the ground oracle can be trained and used in place of it during model validation to measure the mean reward over generated candidates, the evaluation is approximate and vulnerable to adversarial examples. Measuring the mean reward of generated candidates over this approximation is one such `validation metric', whereas we are interested in a more fundamental question which is finding which validation metrics correlate the most with the ground truth. This involves proposing validation metrics and quantifying them over many datasets for which the ground truth is known, for instance simulated environments. This is encapsulated under our proposed evaluation framework which is also designed to measure extrapolation, which is the ultimate goal behind leveraging generative models for MBO. While our evaluation framework is model agnostic we specifically evaluate denoising diffusion models due to their state-of-the-art performance, as well as derive interesting insights such as ranking the most effective validation metrics as well as discussing important hyperparameters",

    "title": "A Simple Video Segmenter by Tracking Objects Along Axial Trajectories",

    "abstract": "Video segmentation requires consistently segmenting and tracking objects over time. Due to the quadratic dependency on input size, directly applying self-attention to video segmentation with high-resolution input features poses significant challenges, often leading to GPU Out-Of-Memory errors. Consequently, modern video segmenters either extend an image segmenter without incorporating any temporal attention or resort to window space-time attention in a naive manner. In this work, we present Axial-VS, a general and simple framework that enhances video segmenters by tracking objects along axial trajectories. The framework tackles video segmentation through two sub-tasks: short-term within-clip segmentation and long-term cross-clip tracking. In the first step, Axial-VS augments an off-the-shelf clip-level video segmenter with the proposed axial-trajectory attention, sequentially tracking objects along the height- and width-trajectories within a clip, thereby enhancing temporal consistency by capturing motion trajectories. The axial decomposition significantly reduces the computational complexity for dense features, and outperforms the window space-time attention in segmentation quality. In the second step, we further employ axial-trajectory attention to the object queries in clip-level segmenters, which are learned to encode object information, thereby aiding object tracking across different clips and achieving consistent segmentation throughout the video. Without bells and whistles, Axial-VS showcases state-of-the-art results on video segmentation benchmarks, emphasizing its effectiveness in addressing the limitations of modern clip-level video segmenters.

The main innovation is that during domain-specific pretraining, an open-domain encoder is continually pre-trained using sentence-level embeddings as inputs (to accommodate long documents), however, fine-tuning is done with token-level embeddings as inputs to this encoder. We perform such domain-specific pre-training on three different domains namely customer support, scientific, and legal domains, and compare performance on 6 different downstream tasks and 9 different datasets. The novel use of document-level supervision along with sentence-level embedding input for pre-training reduces pre-training compute by around 1,000, 4,500, and 500 times compared to MLM and/or NSP in Customer Support, Scientific, and Legal Domains, respectively. The reduced training time does not lead to a deterioration in performance. In fact we show that FastDoc either outperforms or performs on par with several competitive transformer-based baselines in terms of character-level F1 scores and other automated metrics in the Customer Support, Scientific, and Legal Domains. Moreover, reduced training aids in mitigating the risk of catastrophic forgetting. Thus, unlike baselines, FastDoc shows a negligible drop in performance on open domain",

Studies have attempted to bridge two extreme analyses of robustness; one is the worst-case analysis, which often gives too pessimistic certification, and the other is the average-case analysis, which often fails to give a tight guarantee of robustness. Among them, \\textit{Randomized Smoothing} became prominent by certifying a worst-case region of a classifier under input noise. However, the method still suffers from several limitations, probably due to the lack of a larger underlying framework to locate it. Here, inspired by the \\textit{Smoothed Analysis} of algorithmic complexity, which bridges the worst-case and average-case analyses of algorithms, we provide a theoretical framework for robustness analyses of classifiers, which contains \\textit{Randomized Smoothing} as a special case. Using the framework, we also propose a novel robustness analysis that works even in the small noise regime and thus provides a more confident robustness certification than \\textit{Randomized Smoothing}. To validate the approach, we evaluate the robustness of fully connected and convolutional neural networks on the MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets, respectively, and find that it indeed improves both adversarial and noise robustness",

Features with vary- ing relationships to the label are nuisances.

Models that exploit nuisance-label relationships face performance degradation when these relationships change. Building mod- els robust to such changes requires additional knowledge beyond samples of the features and labels. For example, existing work uses annotations of nuisances or assumes erm-trained models depend on nuisances. Approaches to integrate new kinds of additional knowledge enlarge the settings where robust models can be built. We develop an approach to use knowledge about the semantics via data augmentations. These data augmentations cor- rupt semantic information to produce models that identify and adjust for where nuisances drive predictions.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "We propose PRISM to enable users of machine translation systems to preserve the privacy of data on their own initiative. There is a growing demand to apply machine translation systems to data that require privacy protection. While several machine translation engines claim to prioritize privacy, the extent and specifics of such protection are largely ambiguous. First, there is often a lack of clarity on how and to what degree the data is protected. Even if service providers believe they have sufficient safeguards in place, sophisticated adversaries might still extract sensitive information. Second, vulnerabilities may exist outside of these protective measures, such as within communication channels, potentially leading to data leakage. As a result, users are hesitant to utilize machine translation engines for data demanding high levels of privacy protection, thereby missing out on their benefits. PRISM resolves this problem. Instead of relying on the translation service to keep data safe, PRISM provides the means to protect data on the user's side. This approach ensures that even machine translation engines with inadequate privacy measures can be used securely. For platforms already equipped with privacy safeguards, PRISM acts as an additional protection layer, reinforcing their security furthermore. PRISM adds these privacy features without significantly compromising translation accuracy. We prove that PRISM enjoys the theoretical guarantee of word-level differential privacy. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of PRISM using real-world translators, T5 and ChatGPT (GPT-3.5-turbo), and the datasets with two languages. PRISM effectively balances privacy protection with translation accuracy over other user-side privacy protection protocols and helps users grasp the content written in a foreign language without leaking the original content",

Existing approaches adopt a pessimistic stance towards uncertainty by penalizing rewards of under-explored state-action pairs to estimate value functions conservatively. In this paper, we show that the distributionally robust optimization (DRO) based approach can also address these challenges and is {asymptotically minimax optimal}. Specifically, we directly model the uncertainty in the transition kernel and construct an uncertainty set of statistically plausible transition kernels. We then show that the policy that optimizes the worst-case performance over this uncertainty set has a near-optimal performance in the underlying problem. We first design a metric-based distribution-based uncertainty set such that with high probability the true transition kernel is in this set. We prove that to achieve a sub-optimality gap of $\\epsilon$, the sample complexity is $\\mathcal{O}(S^2C^{\\pi^*}\\epsilon^{-2}(1-\\gamma)^{-4})$, where $\\gamma$ is the discount factor, $S$ is the number of states, and $C^{\\pi^*}$ is the single-policy clipped concentrability coefficient which quantifies the distribution shift. To achieve the optimal sample complexity, we further propose a less conservative value-function-based uncertainty set, which, however, does not necessarily include the true transition kernel. We show that an improved sample complexity of $\\mathcal{O}(SC^{\\pi^*}\\epsilon^{-2}(1-\\gamma)^{-3})$ can be obtained, which asymptotically matches with the minimax lower bound for offline reinforcement learning, and thus is asymptotically minimax optimal",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Adaptive gradient-based optimizers, notably Adam, have left their mark in training large-scale deep learning models, offering fast convergence and robustness to hyperparameter settings. However, they often struggle with generalization, attributed to their tendency to converge to sharp minima in the loss landscape. To address this, we propose a new memory-augmented version of Adam that encourages exploration towards flatter minima by incorporating a buffer of critical momentum terms during training. This buffer prompts the optimizer to overshoot beyond narrow minima, promoting exploration. Through comprehensive analysis in simple settings, we illustrate the efficacy of our approach in increasing exploration and bias towards flatter minima. We empirically demonstrate that it can improve model performance for image classification on ImageNet and CIFAR10/100, language modelling on Penn Treebank, and online learning tasks on TinyImageNet and 5-dataset.

    "abstract": "Diffusion models have recently emerged as a potent tool in generative modeling. However, their inherent iterative nature often results in sluggish image generation due to the requirement for multiple model evaluations. Recent progress has unveiled the intrinsic link between diffusion models and Probability Flow Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs), thus enabling us to conceptualize diffusion models as ODE systems. Simultaneously, Physics Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have substantiated their effectiveness in solving intricate differential equations through implicit modeling of their solutions. Building upon these foundational insights, we introduce Physics Informed Distillation (PID), which employs a student model to represent the solution of the ODE system corresponding to the teacher diffusion model, akin to the principles employed in PINNs. Through experiments on CIFAR 10 and ImageNet 64x64, we observe that PID achieves performance comparable to recent distillation methods. Notably, it demonstrates predictable trends concerning method-specific hyperparameters and eliminates the need for synthetic dataset generation during the distillation process. Both of which contribute to its easy-to-use nature as a distillation approach for Diffusion Models",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "With the ever-increasing complexity of large-scale pre-trained models coupled with a shortage of labeled data for downstream training, transfer learning has become the primary approach in many fields, including natural language processing, computer vision, and multi-modal learning. Despite recent progress, the fine-tuning process for large-scale pre-trained models in vision still mostly relies on trial and error. This work investigates the relationship between neural collapse (NC) and transfer learning for classification problems. NC is an intriguing while prevalent phenomenon that has been recently discovered in terms of the final-layer features and linear classifiers of trained neural networks. Specifically, during the terminal phase of training, NC implies that the variability of the features within each class diminishes to zero, while the means of features between classes are maximally and equally distanced. In this work, we examine the NC attributes of pre-trained models on both downstream and training data for transfer learning, and we find strong correlation between feature collapse and downstream performance. In particular, we discovered a systematic pattern that emerges when linear probing pre-trained models on downstream training data: the more feature collapse of pre-trained models on downstream data, the higher the transfer accuracy. Additionally, we also studied the relationship between NC and transfer accuracy on the training data. Moreover, these findings allow us to develop a principled, parameter-efficient fine-tuning method that employs skip-connection to induce the last-layer feature collapse on downstream data. Our proposed fine-tuning methods deliver good performances while reducing fine-tuning parameters by at least 90\\% and mitigating overfitting in situations especially when the downstream data is scarce",

    "abstract": "In recent years, continual learning (CL) techniques have made significant progress in learning from streaming data while preserving knowledge across sequential tasks, particularly in the realm of euclidean data. To foster fair evaluation and recognize challenges in CL settings, several evaluation frameworks have been proposed, focusing mainly on the single- and multi-label classification task on euclidean data. However, these evaluation frameworks are not trivially applicable when the input data is graph-structured, as they do not consider the topological structure inherent in graphs. Existing continual graph learning (CGL) evaluation frameworks have predominantly focussed on single-label scenarios in the node classification (NC) task. This focus has overlooked the complexities of multi-label scenarios, where nodes may exhibit affiliations with multiple labels, simultaneously participating in multiple tasks. We develop a graph-aware evaluation (AGALE) framework that accommodates both single-labeled and multi-labeled nodes, addressing the limitations of previous evaluation frameworks. In particular, we define new incremental settings and devise data partitioning algorithms tailored to CGL datasets. We perform extensive experiments comparing methods from the domains of continual learning, continual graph learning, and dynamic graph learning (DGL). We theoretically analyze \\agale and provide new insights about the role of homophily in the performance of compared methods. We release our framework at https://github.com/Tianqi-py/AGALE",

Comparatively, recent link classification, i.e., to what class an emerging edge belongs to, is investigated much less even though it exists in many industrial settings. In this work, we first formalize recent link classification on temporal graphs as a benchmark downstream task and introduce corresponding benchmark datasets. Secondly, we evaluate the performance of state-of-the-art methods with a statistically meaningful metric Matthews Correlation Coefficient, which is more robust to imbalanced datasets, in addition to the commonly used average precision and area under the curve. We propose several design principles for tailoring models to specific requirements of the task and the dataset including modifications on message aggregation schema, readout layer and time encoding strategy which obtain significant improvement on benchmark datasets. Finally, we propose an architecture that we call Graph Profiler, which is capable of encoding previous events' class information on source and destination nodes. The experiments show that our proposed model achieves an improved Matthews Correlation Coefficient on most cases under interest. We believe the introduction of recent link classification as a benchmark task for temporal graph learning will be useful for the evaluation of prospective methods within the field",

Along with it comes a need for algorithms capable of solving fundamental tasks, such as classification, in hyperbolic space. Recently, multiple papers have investigated hyperbolic alternatives to hyperplane-based classifiers, such as logistic regression and SVMs. While effective, these approaches struggle with more complex hierarchical data. We, therefore, propose to generalize the well-known random forests to hyperbolic space. We do this by redefining the notion of a split using horospheres. Since finding the globally optimal split is computationally intractable, we find candidate horospheres through a large-margin classifier. To make hyperbolic random forests work on multi-class data and imbalanced experiments, we furthermore outline new methods for combining classes based on the lowest common ancestor and class-balanced large-margin losses.

Our method aims to deliver robust policy evaluation results in the presence of discrepancies in both context and policy distribution between logging and target data. Central to our methodology is the application of robust regression — a distributionally robust technique tailored here to improve the estimation of conditional reward distribution from logging data. Utilizing the reward model obtained from robust regression, we develop a comprehensive suite of policy value estimators, by integrating our reward model into established evaluation frameworks, namely direct methods and doubly robust methods. Through theoretical analysis, we further establish that the proposed policy value estimators offer a finite sample upper bound for the bias, providing a clear advantage over traditional methods, especially when the shift is large. Finally, we designed an extensive range of policy evaluation scenarios, covering diverse magnitudes of shifts and a spectrum of logging and target policies. Our empirical results indicate that our approach significantly outperforms baseline methods, most notably in 90% of the cases under the policy shift-only settings and 72% of the scenarios under the general covariate shift settings",

While traditional statistical approaches like approximate Bayesian computation and Bayesian synthetic likelihood have been studied under well-specified and misspecified settings, they often suffer from inefficiencies due to wasted model simulations. Neural approaches, such as sequential neural likelihood (SNL) avoid this wastage by utilising all model simulations to train a neural surrogate for the likelihood function. However, the performance of SNL under model misspecification is unreliable and can result in overconfident posteriors centred around an inaccurate parameter estimate. In this paper, we propose a novel SNL method, which through the incorporation of additional adjustment parameters, is robust to model misspecification and capable of identifying features of the data that the model is not able to recover. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach through several illustrative examples, where our method gives more accurate point estimates and uncertainty quantification than SNL",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Compact and energy-efficient models have become essential in this era when deep learning-based solutions are widely used for various real-life tasks. In this paper, we propose rotating the ReLU activation to give an additional degree of freedom in conjunction with the appropriate initialization of the rotation. This combination leads to implicit sparsification without the use of a regularizer. We show that this rotated ReLU (RReLU) activation improves the representation capability of the parameters/filters in the network and eliminates those parameters/filters that are not crucial for the task, giving rise to significant savings in memory and computation. While the state-of-the-art regularization-based Network-Slimming method achieves $32.33\\%$ saving in memory and $26.38\\%$ saving in computation with ResNet-$164$, RReLU achieves a saving of $35.92\\%$ in memory and $25.97\\%$ in the computation with a better accuracy. The savings in memory and computation further increase by $64.67\\%$ and $52.96\\%$, respectively, with the introduction of $L_1$ regularization to the RReLU slopes. We note that the slopes of the rotated ReLU activations act as coarse feature extractors and can eliminate unnecessary features before retraining. Our studies indicate that features always choose to pass through a lesser number of filters. We demonstrate the results with popular datasets such as MNIST, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, SVHN, and Imagenet with different architectures, including Vision Transformers and EfficientNet. We also briefly study the impact of adversarial attacks on RReLU-based ResNets and observe that we get better adversarial accuracy for the architectures with RReLU than ReLU. We also demonstrate how this concept of rotation can be applied to the GELU and SiLU activation functions, commonly utilized in Transformer and EfficientNet architectures, respectively. The proposed method can be utilized by combining with other structural pruning methods resulting in better sparsity. For the GELU-based multi-layer perceptron (MLP) part of the Transformer, we obtain $2.6\\%$ improvement in accuracy with $6.32\\%$ saving in both memory and computation",

We then exhaustively assess the validity of these theoretical conclusions on a large corpus of synthetic, semi-real, and real datasets.

    "abstract": "Estimating treatment effects from observational data is often subject to a covariate shift problem incurred by selection bias. Recent research has sought to mitigate this problem by leveraging representation balancing methods that aim to extract balancing patterns from observational data and utilize them for outcome prediction. The underlying theoretical rationale is that minimizing the unobserved counterfactual error can be achieved through two principles: (I) reducing the risk associated with predicting factual outcomes and (II) mitigating the distributional discrepancy between the treated and controlled samples. However, an inherent trade-off between the two principles can lead to a potential loss of information useful for factual outcome predictions and, consequently, deteriorating treatment effect estimations. In this paper, we propose a novel representation balancing model, DIGNet, for treatment effect estimation. DIGNet incorporates two key components, PDIG and PPBR, which effectively mitigate the trade-off problem by improving one aforementioned principle without sacrificing the other. Specifically, PDIG captures more effective balancing patterns (Principle II) without affecting factual outcome predictions (Principle I), while PPBR enhances factual outcome prediction (Principle I) without affecting the learning of balancing patterns (Principle II). The ablation studies verify the effectiveness of PDIG and PPBR in improving treatment effect estimation, and experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate the superior performance of our DIGNet model compared to baseline models",

    "abstract": "A peculiarity of conversational search systems is that they involve mixed-initiatives such as system-generated query clarifying questions. Evaluating those systems at a large scale on the end task of IR is very challenging, requiring adequate datasets containing such interactions. However, current datasets only focus on either traditional ad-hoc IR tasks or query clarification tasks, the latter being usually seen as a reformulation task from the initial query. Only few datasets are known to contain both document relevance judgments and the associated clarification interactions such as Qulac and ClariQ. Both are based on the TREC Web Track 2009-12 collection but cover a very limited number of topics (237 topics), far from being enough for training and testing conversational IR models. To fill the gap, we propose a methodology to automatically build large-scale conversational IR datasets from ad-hoc IR datasets in order to facilitate explorations on conversational IR. Our methodology is based on two processes: 1) generating query clarification interactions through query clarification and answer generators, and 2) augmenting ad-hoc IR datasets with simulated interactions. In this paper, we focus on MsMarco and augment it with query clarification and answer simulations. We perform a thorough evaluation showing the quality and the relevance of the generated interactions for each initial query.

    "abstract": "Modern image classification is based on directly predicting classes via large discriminative networks, which do not directly contain information about the intuitive visual features that may constitute a classification decision. Recently, work in vision-language models (VLM) such as CLIP has provided ways to specify natural language descriptions of image classes, but typically focuses on providing single descriptions for each class. In this work, we demonstrate that an alternative approach, in line with humans' understanding of multiple visual features per class, can also provide compelling performance in the robust few-shot learning setting. In particular, we introduce a novel method, \\textit{SLR-AVD (Sparse Logistic Regression using Augmented Visual Descriptors)}. This method first automatically generates multiple visual descriptions of each class via a large language model (LLM), then uses a VLM to translate these descriptions to a set of visual feature embeddings of each image, and finally uses sparse logistic regression to select a relevant subset of these features to classify each image. Core to our approach is the fact that, information-theoretically, these descriptive features are more invariant to domain shift than traditional image embeddings, even though the VLM training process is not explicitly designed for invariant representation learning. These invariant descriptive features also compose a better input compression scheme. When combined with finetuning, we show that SLR-AVD is able to outperform existing state-of-the-art finetuning approaches in both in-distribution and out-of-distribution tasks",

With this contextual information, our method, named S4MC, increases the amount of unlabeled data used during training while maintaining the quality of the pseudo-labels, all with negligible computational overhead. Through extensive experiments on standard benchmarks, we demonstrate that S4MC outperforms existing state-of-the-art semi-supervised learning approaches, offering a promising solution for reducing the cost of acquiring dense annotations. For example, S4MC achieves a 1.39 mIoU improvement over the prior art on PASCAL VOC 12 with 366 annotated images. The code to reproduce our experiments is available at https://s4mcontext.github.io/",

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive performance on complex reasoning by leveraging chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting to generate intermediate reasoning chains as the rationale to infer the answer. However, existing CoT studies have primarily focused on the language modality. We propose Multimodal-CoT that incorporates language (text) and vision (images) modalities into a two-stage framework that separates rationale generation and answer inference. In this way, answer inference can leverage better generated rationales that are based on multimodal information. Experimental results on ScienceQA and A-OKVQA benchmark datasets show the effectiveness of our proposed approach. With Multimodal-CoT, our model under 1 billion parameters achieves state-of-the-art performance on the ScienceQA benchmark. Our analysis indicates that Multimodal-CoT offers the advantages of mitigating hallucination and enhancing convergence speed. Code is publicly available at https://github.com/amazon-science/mm-cot",

By leveraging graph message-passing layers, graph feature augmentation and contrastive learning, the proposed CGAE embeds highly discriminative latent embeddings by reconstructing graph features w.r.t. the graph representations of input polygons, outperforming existing graph-based autoencoders (GAEs) in geometry retrieval of similar polygons. Experimentally, we demonstrate this capability based on template query shapes on real-world datasets and show its high robustness to geometric transformations in contrast to existing GAEs, indicating the strong generalizability and versatility of CGAE, including on complex real-world building footprints",

    "abstract": "Explainable AI (XAI) has unfolded in two distinct research directions with, on the one hand, post-hoc methods that explain the predictions of a pre-trained black-box model and, on the other hand, self-explainable models (SEMs) which are trained directly to provide explanations alongside their predictions. While the latter is preferred in safety-critical scenarios, post-hoc approaches have received the majority of attention until now, owing to their simplicity and ability to explain base models without retraining. Current SEMs, instead, require complex architectures and heavily regularized loss functions, thus necessitating specific and costly training. To address this shortcoming and facilitate wider use of SEMs, we propose a simple yet efficient universal method called KMEx (K-Means Explainer), which can convert any existing pre-trained model into a prototypical SEM. The motivation behind KMEx is to enhance transparency in deep learning-based decision-making via class-prototype-based explanations that are diverse and trustworthy without retraining the base model. We compare models obtained from KMEx to state-of-the-art SEMs using an extensive qualitative evaluation to highlight the strengths and weaknesses of each model, further paving the way toward a more reliable and objective evaluation of SEMs\\footnote{The code is available at https://github.com/SrishtiGautam/KMEx}",

    "title": "Conservative Prediction via Data-Driven Confidence Minimization",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "In safety-critical applications of machine learning, it is often desirable for a model to be \\textit{conservative}, abstaining from making predictions on ``unknown'' inputs which are not well-represented in the training data. However, detecting unknown examples is challenging, as it is impossible to anticipate all potential inputs at test time. To address this, prior work minimizes model confidence on an auxiliary outlier dataset carefully curated to be disjoint from the training distribution. We theoretically analyze the choice of auxiliary dataset for confidence minimization, revealing two actionable insights: (1) if the auxiliary set contains unknown examples similar to those seen at test time, confidence minimization leads to provable detection of unknown test examples, and (2) if the first condition is satisfied, it is unnecessary to filter out known examples for out-of-distribution (OOD) detection. Motivated by these guidelines, we propose the Data-Driven Confidence Minimization (DCM) framework, which minimizes confidence on an \\textit{uncertainty dataset}. We apply DCM to two problem settings in which conservative prediction is paramount -- selective classification and OOD detection -- and provide a realistic way to gather uncertainty data for each setting. In our experiments, DCM consistently outperforms existing selective classification approaches on 4 datasets when tested on unseen distributions and outperforms state-of-the-art OOD detection methods on 12 ID-OOD dataset pairs, reducing FPR (at TPR $95\\%$) by $6.3\\%$ and $58.1\\%$ on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 compared to Outlier Exposure",

We introduce the \\textbf{C}ommonSense \\textbf{O}bject \\textbf{A}ffordance \\textbf{T}ask \\textbf{(COAT)}, a novel framework designed to analyze reasoning capabilities in commonsense scenarios. This approach is centered on understanding how these agents can effectively identify and utilize alternative objects when executing household tasks, thereby offering insights into the complexities of practical decision-making in real-world environments. Drawing inspiration from factors affecting human decision-making, we explore how large language models tackle this challenge through four meticulously crafted commonsense question-and-answer datasets featuring refined rules and human annotations. Our evaluation of state-of-the-art language models on these datasets sheds light on three pivotal considerations: 1) aligning an object's inherent utility with the task at hand, 2) navigating contextual dependencies (societal norms, safety, appropriateness, and efficiency), and 3) accounting for the current physical state of the object. To maintain accessibility, we introduce five abstract variables reflecting an object's physical condition, modulated by human insights, to simulate diverse household scenarios. Our contributions include insightful human preference mappings for all three factors and four extensive QA datasets (2K, 15k, 60k, 70K questions) probing the intricacies of utility dependencies, contextual dependencies and object physical states.

    "abstract": "We propose a methodology for planting watermarks in text from an autoregressive language model that are robust to perturbations without changing the distribution over text up to a certain maximum generation budget. We generate watermarked text by mapping a sequence of random numbers—which we compute using a randomized watermark key—to a sample from the language model. To detect watermarked text, any party who knows the key can align the text to the random number sequence. We instantiate our watermark methodology with two sampling schemes: inverse transform sampling and exponential minimum sampling. We apply these watermarks to three language models—OPT-1.3B, LLaMA-7B and Alpaca-7B—to experimentally validate their statistical power and robustness to various paraphrasing attacks. Notably, for both the OPT-1.3B and LLaMA-7B models, we find we can reliably detect watermarked text ($p \\leq 0.01$) from $35$ tokens even after corrupting between $40$-$50$\\% of the tokens via random edits (i.e., substitutions, insertions or deletions). For the Alpaca-7B model, we conduct a case study on the feasibility of watermarking responses to typical user instructions. Due to the lower entropy of the responses, detection is more difficult: around $25\\%$ of the responses—whose median length is around $100$ tokens—are detectable with $p \\leq 0.01$, and the watermark is also less robust to certain automated paraphrasing attacks we implement",

Its Bayesian counterpart can further provide uncertainty quantification and improved generalization accuracy. This paper investigates low-precision sampling via Stochastic Gradient Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (SGHMC) with low-precision and full-precision gradient accumulators for both strongly log-concave and non-log-concave distributions. Theoretically, our results show that to achieve $\\epsilon$-error in the 2-Wasserstein distance for non-log-concave distributions, low-precision SGHMC achieves quadratic improvement ($\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}\\left({\\epsilon^{-2}{\\mu^*}^{-2}\\log^2\\left({\\epsilon^{-1}}\\right)}\\right)$) compared to the state-of-the-art low-precision sampler, Stochastic Gradient Langevin Dynamics (SGLD) ($\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}\\left({{\\epsilon}^{-4}{\\lambda^{*}}^{-1}\\log^5\\left({\\epsilon^{-1}}\\right)}\\right)$). Moreover, we prove that low-precision SGHMC is more robust to the quantization error compared to low-precision SGLD due to the robustness of the momentum-based update w.r.t. gradient noise. Empirically, we conduct experiments on synthetic data, and MNIST, CIFAR-10 \\& CIFAR-100 datasets, which validate our theoretical findings.

    "abstract": "Score-based generative models (SGMs) are powerful tools to sample from complex data distributions. Their underlying idea is to \\emph{(i)} run a forward process for time $T_1$ by adding noise to the data, \\emph{(ii)} estimate its score function, and \\emph{(iii)} use such estimate to run a reverse process. As the reverse process is initialized with the stationary distribution of the forward one, the existing analysis paradigm requires $T_1\\to\\infty$. This is however problematic: from a theoretical viewpoint, for a given precision of the score approximation, the convergence guarantee fails as $T_1$ diverges; from a practical viewpoint, a large $T_1$ increases computational costs and leads to error propagation. This paper addresses the issue by considering a version of the popular \\emph{predictor-corrector} scheme: after running the forward process, we first estimate the final distribution via an inexact Langevin dynamics and then revert the process. Our key technical contribution is to provide convergence guarantees which require to run the forward process \\emph{only for a fixed finite time} $T_1$. Our bounds exhibit a mild logarithmic dependence on the input dimension and the subgaussian norm of the target distribution, have minimal assumptions on the data, and require only to control the $L^2$ loss on the score approximation, which is the quantity minimized in practice",

    "abstract": "The advent of ubiquitous multidimensional arrays poses unique challenges for low-rank modeling of tensor data due to higher-order relationships, gross noise, and large dimensions of the tensor. In this paper, we consider online low-rank estimation of tensor data where the multidimensional data are revealed sequentially. Induced by the recently proposed tensor-tensor product (t-product), we rigorously deduce the tensor max-norm and formulate the tensor max-norm into an equivalent tensor factorization form, where the factors consist of a tensor basis component and a coefficient one. With this formulation, we develop an online max-norm regularized tensor decomposition (OMRTD) method by alternatively optimizing over the basis component and the coefficient tensor. The algorithm is scalable to the large-scale setting and the sequence of the solutions produced by OMRTD converges to a stationary point of the expected loss function asymptotically. Further, we extend OMRTD for tensor completion. Numerical experiments demonstrate encouraging results for the effectiveness and robustness of our algorithm.

    "abstract": "The security and robustness of AI systems are paramount in real-world applications. Previous research has focused on developing methods to train robust networks, assuming the availability of sufficient labeled training data. However, in deployment scenarios with limited training data, existing techniques for training robust networks become impractical. In such low-data scenarios, non-robust training methods often resort to transfer learning. This involves pre-training a network on a large, possibly labeled dataset and fine-tuning it for a new task with a limited set of training samples. The efficacy of transfer learning in enhancing adversarial robustness is not comprehensively explored. Specifically, it remains uncertain whether transfer learning can improve adversarial performance in low-data scenarios. Furthermore, the potential benefits of transfer learning for certified robustness are unexplored. In this paper, we conduct an extensive analysis of the impact of transfer learning on both empirical and certified adversarial robustness. Employing supervised and self-supervised pre-training methods and fine-tuning across 12 downstream tasks representing diverse data availability scenarios, we identify the conditions conducive to training adversarially robust models through transfer learning. Our study reveals that the effectiveness of transfer learning in improving adversarial robustness is attributed to an increase in standard accuracy and not the direct ``transfer'' of robustness from the source to the target task, contrary to previous beliefs.

    "abstract": "End-to-end (E2E) training, optimizing the entire model through error backpropagation, fundamentally supports the advancements of deep learning. Despite its high performance, E2E training faces the problems of memory consumption, parallel computing, and discrepancy with the functionalities of the actual brain. Various alternative methods have been proposed to overcome these difficulties; however, no one can yet match the performance of E2E training, thereby falling short in practicality. Furthermore, there is no deep understanding regarding differences in the trained model properties beyond the performance gap. In this paper, we reconsider why E2E training demonstrates a superior performance through a comparison with layer-wise training, which shares fundamental learning principles and architectures with E2E training, with the granularity of loss evaluation being the only difference. On the basis of the observation that E2E training has an advantage in propagating input information, we analyze the information plane dynamics of intermediate representations based on the Hilbert-Schmidt independence criterion (HSIC). The results of our normalized HSIC value analysis reveal the E2E training ability to exhibit different information dynamics across layers, in addition to efficient information propagation. Furthermore, we show that this layer-role differentiation leads to the final representation following the information bottleneck principle. Our work not only provides the advantages of E2E training in terms of information propagation and the information bottleneck but also suggests the need to consider the cooperative interactions between layers, not just the final layer when analyzing the information bottleneck of deep learning",

Building on this insight, we introduce a new measure called Softmax Correlation (SoftmaxCorr). It calculates the cosine similarity between a class-class correlation matrix, constructed from Softmax output vectors across an unlabeled test dataset, and a predefined reference matrix that embodies ideal class correlations. A high resemblance of predictions to the reference matrix signals that the model delivers confident and uniform predictions across all categories, reflecting minimal uncertainty and confusion. Through rigorous evaluation across a suite of datasets, including ImageNet, CIFAR-10, and WILDS, we affirm the predictive validity of SoftmaxCorr in accurately forecasting model performance within both in-distribution (ID) and OOD settings.

    "abstract": "Language models often achieve higher accuracy when reasoning step-by-step in complex tasks. However, even when arriving at a correct final answer, their rationales are often logically unsound or inconsistent. This is a major issue when reliable reasoning traces are needed, such as when fine-tuning on model-generated reasoning for self-improvement. To tackle these issues, we introduce a class of tools for language models called guides, that use state and incremental constraints to guide generation. A guide can be invoked by the model to constrain its own generation to a set of valid statements given by the tool. In turn, the model's choices can change the guide's state. We show how a general system for logical reasoning can be used as a guide, which we call LogicGuide. Given a reasoning problem in natural language, a model can formalize its assumptions for LogicGuide and guarantee that its step-by-step reasoning is sound. In experiments on PrOntoQA, ProofWriter and Syllogism Validity datasets, LogicGuide significantly improves the performance of GPT-3, GPT-3.5 Turbo and LLaMA (accuracy gains up to 35%), while drastically reducing content effects — the interference between unwanted prior assumptions and reasoning, which humans and language models suffer from. We then explore bootstrapping GPT-3.5 Turbo and LLaMA using their own reasoning traces. We find that LogicGuide is critical: by training only on certified self-generated reasoning, models can self-improve, avoiding learning from their own hallucinations. Moreover, bootstrapped models enjoy significant boosts on ReClor, a challenging real-world reasoning dataset, even when not relying on formalization at inference time",

Focusing on per-instance differential privacy (pDP), our framework elucidates the potential privacy leakage for each data point in a given training dataset, offering insights into how the privacy loss of each point correlates with the dataset's distribution. Our bounds also show that training with $s$-sized data points leads to a surge in privacy leakage from $(\\epsilon, \\mathcal{O}(\\frac{1}{s^2\\epsilon}))$-pDP to $(\\epsilon, \\mathcal{O}(\\frac{1}{s\\epsilon}))$-pDP of the DDM during the transition from the pure noise to the synthetic clean data phase, and a faster decay in diffusion coefficients amplifies the privacy guarantee.

To that end, we present that a simple adjustment of model logits during training can effectively resist prior class bias and pursue the corresponding optimum. Our proposed method, Logit Adjusted Softmax, can mitigate the impact of inter-class imbalance not only in class-incremental but also in realistic scenarios that sum up class and domain incremental learning, with little additional computational cost.

We propose two new segmentation \\ac{tta} methods and compare them to established baselines and recent state-of-the-art. The methods are first validated on synthetic domain shifts and then tested on real-world datasets. The analysis highlights that simple modifications such as the choice of the loss function can greatly improve the performance of standard baselines and that different methods and hyper-parameters are optimal for different kinds of domain shift, hindering the development of fully general methods applicable in situations where no prior knowledge about the domain shift is assumed",

    "title": "Normed Spaces for Graph Embedding",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Theoretical results from discrete geometry suggest that normed spaces can abstractly embed finite metric spaces with surprisingly low theoretical bounds on distortion in low dimensions. Inspired by this theoretical insight, we highlight in this paper normed spaces as a more flexible and computationally efficient alternative to several popular Riemannian manifolds for learning graph embeddings. Normed space embeddings significantly outperform several popular manifolds on a large range of synthetic and real-world graph reconstruction benchmark datasets while requiring significantly fewer computational resources. We also empirically verify the superiority of normed space embeddings on growing families of graphs associated with negative, zero, and positive curvature, further reinforcing the flexibility of normed spaces in capturing diverse graph structures as graph sizes increase. Lastly, we demonstrate the utility of normed space embeddings on two applied graph embedding tasks, namely, link prediction and recommender systems. Our work highlights the potential of normed spaces for geometric graph representation learning, raises new research questions, and offers a valuable tool for experimental mathematics in the field of finite metric space embeddings.

The parameter functions underlying both stochastic processes of interest are modeled via a basis representation, and Bayesian inference is conducted via an integrated nested Laplace approximation.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "After the recent ground-breaking advances in protein structure prediction, one of the remaining challenges in protein machine learning is to reliably predict distributions of structural states. Parametric models of fluctuations are difficult to fit due to complex covariance structures between degrees of freedom in the protein chain, often causing models to either violate local or global structural constraints. In this paper, we present a new strategy for modelling protein densities in internal coordinates, which uses constraints in 3D space to induce covariance structure between the internal degrees of freedom. We illustrate the potential of the procedure by constructing a variational autoencoder with full covariance output induced by the constraints implied by the conditional mean in 3D, and demonstrate that our approach makes it possible to scale density models of internal coordinates to full protein backbones in two settings: 1) a unimodal setting for proteins exhibiting small fluctuations and limited amounts of available data, and 2) a multimodal setting for larger conformational changes in a high data regime",

Observing that this latent space can be modeled with simple distributions, we use a Mixture of Gaussians (MoG) formalism to enhance the interpretability of this latent space. Then, we introduce CLIP-QDA, a classifier that only uses statistical values to infer labels from the concepts. In addition, this formalism allows for both local and global explanations. These explanations come from the inner design of our architecture, our work is part of a new family of greybox models, combining performances of opaque foundation models and the interpretability of transparent models.

Existing approaches often have limitations, such as relying on parametric assumptions, detecting only linear associations, and requiring multiple tests and corrections. While many non-parametric and universally consistent dependence measures have recently been proposed, directly applying them to temporal data can inflate the p-value and result in an invalid test. To address these challenges, this paper introduces the temporal dependence statistic with block permutation to test independence between temporal data. Under proper assumptions, the proposed procedure is asymptotically valid and universally consistent for testing independence between stationary time series, and capable of estimating the optimal dependence lag that maximizes the dependence. Moreover, it is compatible with a rich family of distance and kernel based dependence measures, eliminates the need for multiple testing, and exhibits excellent testing power in various simulation settings",

    "abstract": "This paper presents a simple and effective visual prompting method for adapting pre-trained models to downstream recognition tasks. Our approach is underpinned by two key designs. First, rather than directly adding together the prompt and the image, we treat the prompt as an extra and independent learnable entity. We show that the strategy of reconciling the prompt and the image matters, and find that warping the prompt around a properly shrinked image empirically works the best. Second, we re-introduce two \"old tricks\" commonly used in building transferable adversarial examples, i.e., input diversity and gradient normalization, into the realm of visual prompting. These techniques improve optimization and enable the prompt to generalize better. We provide extensive experimental results to demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. Using a CLIP model, our prompting method registers a new record of 82.5% average accuracy across 12 popular classification datasets, substantially surpassing the prior art by +5.2%. It is worth noting that such performance not only surpasses linear probing by +2.2%, but, in certain datasets, is on par with the results from fully fine-tuning. Additionally, our prompting method shows competitive performance across different data scales and against distribution shifts",

In many settings, however, the posterior distribution is not the end goal itself --- rather, the derived parameter values and their uncertainties are used as a basis for deciding what actions to take. Unfortunately, because posterior distributions provided by SBI are (potentially crude) approximations of the true posterior, the resulting decisions can be suboptimal. Here, we address the question of how to perform Bayesian decision making on stochastic simulators, and how one can circumvent the need to compute an explicit approximation to the posterior. Our method trains a neural network on simulated data and can predict the expected cost given any data and action, and can, thus, be directly used to infer the action with lowest cost. We apply our method to several benchmark problems and demonstrate that it induces similar cost as the true posterior distribution. We then apply the method to infer optimal actions in a real-world simulator in the medical neurosciences, the Bayesian Virtual Epileptic Patient, and demonstrate that it allows to infer actions associated with low cost after few simulations",

    "abstract": "Recently, adversarial attacks that generate adversarial examples by optimizing a multimodal function with many local optimums have attracted considerable research attention. Quick convergence to a nearby local optimum (intensification) and fast enumeration of multiple different local optima (diversification) are important to construct strong attacks. Most existing white-box attacks that use the model's gradient enumerate multiple local optima based on multi-restart; however, our experiments suggest that the ability of diversification based on multi-restart is limited. To tackle this problem, we propose the multi-directions/objectives (MDO) strategy, which uses multiple search directions and objective functions for diversification. Efficient Diversified Attack, a combination of MDO and multi-target strategies, showed further diversification performance, resulting in better performance than recently proposed attacks against around 88% of 41 CNN-based robust models and 100% of 10 more advanced models, including transformer-based architecture. These results suggest a relationship between attack performances and a balance of diversification and intensification, which is beneficial to constructing more potent attacks",

To tackle the problem, we extend the Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) into the realm of model robustness, offering a novel perspective and developing SNR-inspired losses aimed at optimizing neuron variance and stability to mitigate over-regularization. Through both empirical and theoretical analysis, our SNR-based approach demonstrates superior performance over existing methods on the MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets.

However, gauging the trustworthiness of responses generated by LLMs remains an open challenge, with limited research on uncertainty quantification (UQ) for NLG. Furthermore, existing literature typically assumes white-box access to language models, which is becoming unrealistic either due to the closed-source nature of the latest LLMs or computational constraints. In this work, we investigate UQ in NLG for *black-box* LLMs. We first differentiate *uncertainty* vs *confidence*: the former refers to the ``dispersion'' of the potential predictions for a fixed input, and the latter refers to the confidence on a particular prediction/generation. We then propose and compare several confidence/uncertainty measures, applying them to *selective NLG* where unreliable results could either be ignored or yielded for further assessment. Experiments were carried out with several popular LLMs on question-answering datasets (for evaluation purposes). Results reveal that a simple measure for the semantic dispersion can be a reliable predictor of the quality of LLM responses, providing valuable insights for practitioners on uncertainty management when adopting LLMs",

Significantly, the encoder is frozen during the pre-training phase of the sequence decoder.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Data distillation aims to generate a small data set that closely mimics the performance of a given learning algorithm on the original data set. The distilled dataset is hence useful to simplify the training process thanks to its small data size. However, distilled data samples are not necessarily privacy-preserving, even if they are generally humanly indiscernible. To address this limitation, we introduce differentially private kernel inducing points (DP-KIP) for privacy-preserving data distillation. Unlike our original intention to simply apply DP-SGD to the framework of KIP, we find that KIP using infinitely-wide convolutional neural tangent kernels (conv-NTKs) performs better compared to KIP using fully-connected NTKs. However, KIP with conv-NTKs, due to its convolutional and pooling operations, introduces an unbearable computational complexity, requiring hundreds of V100 GPUs in parallel to train, which is impractical and more importantly, such computational resources are inaccessible to many. To overcome this issue, we propose an alternative that does not require pre-training (to avoid a privacy loss) and can well capture complex information on images, as those features from conv-NKTs do, while the computational cost is manageable by a single V100 GPU. To this end, we propose DP-KIP-ScatterNet, which uses the wavelet features from Scattering networks (ScatterNet) instead of those from conv-NTKs, to perform DP-KIP at a reasonable computational cost. We implement DP-KIP-ScatterNet in -- computationally efficient -- JAX and test on several popular image datasets to show its efficacy and its superior performance compared to state-of-the art methods in image data distillation with differential privacy guarantees.

However, the increasing concerns regarding the misuse of LLMs, such as plagiarism and spamming, have led to the development of multiple detectors, including fine-tuned classifiers and statistical methods. In this study, we equip LLMs with prompts, rather than relying on an external paraphraser, to evaluate the vulnerability of these detectors. We propose a novel Substitution-based In-Context example Optimization method (SICO) to automatically construct prompts for evading the detectors. SICO is cost-efficient as it requires only 40 human-written examples and a limited number of LLM inferences to generate a prompt. Moreover, once a task-specific prompt has been constructed, it can be universally used against a wide range of detectors. Extensive experiments across three real-world tasks demonstrate that SICO significantly outperforms the paraphraser baselines and enables GPT-3.5 to successfully evade six detectors, decreasing their AUC by 0.5 on average. Furthermore, a comprehensive human evaluation show that the SICO-generated text achieves human-level readability and task completion rates, while preserving high imperceptibility. Finally, we propose an ensemble approach to enhance the robustness of detectors against SICO attack",

Among their many applications is signal compression, for which there is great interest in achieving the highest possible fidelity to the original signal subject to constraints such as neural network size, training (encoding) and inference (decoding) time. But training INRs can be a computationally expensive process, making it challenging to determine the best possible tradeoff under such constraints. Towards this goal, we propose a novel problem: predicting the encoding error (i.e. training loss) that an INR will reach on a given training signal. We present a method which predicts the encoding error that a popular INR network (SIREN) will reach, given its network hyperparameters and the signal to encode. This method is trained on a unique dataset of 300,000 SIRENs, trained across a variety of images and hyperparameters. Our predictive method demonstrates the feasibility of this regression problem, and allows users to anticipate the encoding error that a SIREN network will reach in milliseconds instead of minutes or longer. We also provide insights into the behavior of SIREN networks, such as why narrow SIRENs can have very high random variation in encoding error, and how the performance of SIRENs relates to JPEG compression",

We establish upper bounds on the suboptimality of the learning agent with respect to the divergence between the expert and the agent latent state-transition distributions. Motivated by this analysis, we introduce an algorithm called Latent Adversarial Imitation from Observations, which combines off-policy adversarial imitation techniques with a learned latent representation of the agent's state from sequences of observations. In experiments on high-dimensional continuous robotic tasks, we show that our model-free approach in latent space matches state-of-the-art performance. Additionally, we show how our method can be used to improve the efficiency of reinforcement learning from pixels by leveraging expert videos. To ensure reproducibility, we provide free access to all the learning curves and open-source our code",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Deep generative models have shown tremendous capability in data density estimation and data generation from finite samples. While these models have shown impressive performance by learning correlations among features in the data, some fundamental shortcomings are their lack of explainability, tendency to induce spurious correlations, and poor out-of-distribution extrapolation. To remedy such challenges, recent work has proposed a shift toward causal generative models. Causal models offer several beneficial properties to deep generative models, such as distribution shift robustness, fairness, and interpretability. Structural causal models (SCMs) describe data-generating processes and model complex causal relationships and mechanisms among variables in a system. Thus, SCMs can naturally be combined with deep generative models. We provide a technical survey on causal generative modeling categorized into causal representation learning and controllable counterfactual generation methods. We focus on fundamental theory, methodology, drawbacks, datasets, and metrics. Then, we cover applications of causal generative models in fairness, privacy, out-of-distribution generalization, precision medicine, and biological sciences. Lastly, we discuss open problems and fruitful research directions for future work in the field",

Representation learning for imaging genetics is largely under-explored due to the unique challenges posed by GWAS in comparison to typical visual representation learning. In this study, we tackle this problem from the mutual information (MI) perspective by identifying key limitations of existing methods. We introduce a trans-modal learning framework Genetic InfoMax (GIM), including a regularized MI estimator and a novel genetics-informed transformer to address the specific challenges of GWAS.

    "abstract": "Real-world applications of machine learning models often confront data distribution shifts, wherein discrepancies exist between the training and test data distributions. In the common multi-domain multi-class setup, as the number of classes and domains scales up, it becomes infeasible to gather training data for every domain-class combination. This challenge naturally leads the quest for models with Compositional Generalization (CG) ability, where models can generalize to unseen domain-class combinations. To delve into the CG challenge, we develop CG-Bench, a suite of CG benchmarks derived from existing real-world image datasets, and observe that the prevalent pretraining-finetuning paradigm on foundational models, such as CLIP and DINOv2, struggles with the challenge. To address this challenge, we propose Compositional Feature Alignment (CFA), a simple two-stage finetuning technique that i) learns two orthogonal linear heads on a pretrained encoder with respect to class and domain labels, and ii) fine-tunes the encoder with the newly learned head frozen. We theoretically and empirically justify that CFA encourages compositional feature learning of pretrained models. We further conduct extensive experiments on CG-Bench for CLIP and DINOv2, two powerful pretrained vision foundation models. Experiment results show that CFA outperforms common finetuning techniques in compositional generalization, corroborating CFA's efficacy in compositional feature learning",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "The gradient descent (GD) method has been used widely to solve parameter estimation in generalized linear models (GLMs), a generalization of linear models when the link function can be non-linear. In GLMs with a polynomial link function, it has been shown that in the high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime, due to the problem's strong convexity and smoothness, GD converges linearly and reaches the final desired accuracy in a logarithmic number of iterations. In contrast, in the low SNR setting, where the problem becomes locally convex, GD converges at a slower rate and requires a polynomial number of iterations to reach the desired accuracy. Even though Newton's method can be used to resolve the flat curvature of the loss functions in the low SNR case, its computational cost is prohibitive in high-dimensional settings as it is $\\mathcal{O}(d^3)$, where $d$ the is the problem dimension. To address the shortcomings of GD and Newton's method, we propose the use of the BFGS quasi-Newton method to solve parameter estimation of the GLMs, which has a per iteration cost of $\\mathcal{O}(d^2)$. When the SNR is low, for GLMs with a polynomial link function of degree $p$, we demonstrate that the iterates of BFGS converge linearly to the optimal solution of the population least-square loss function, and the contraction coefficient of the BFGS algorithm is comparable to that of Newton's method. Moreover, the contraction factor of the linear rate is independent of problem parameters and only depends on the degree of the link function $p$. Also, for the empirical loss with $n$ samples, we prove that in the low SNR setting of GLMs with a polynomial link function of degree $p$, the iterates of BFGS reach a final statistical radius of $\\mathcal{O}((d/n)^{\\frac{1}{2p+2}})$ after at most $\\log(n/d)$ iterations. This complexity is significantly less than the number required for GD, which scales polynomially with $(n/d)$",

However, given the local nature of the convolutional operator, they struggle to capture global information. The promise of attention mechanisms in Transformers is to circumvent this problem, but it comes at the cost of intensive computational overhead. Many recent studies in image restoration have focused on solving the challenge of balancing performance and computational cost via Transformer variants. In this paper, we present CascadedGaze Network (CGNet), an encoder-decoder architecture that employs Global Context Extractor (GCE), a novel and efficient way to capture global information for image restoration. The GCE module leverages small kernels across convolutional layers to learn global dependencies, without requiring self-attention.

    "abstract": "In this paper, we focus on the problem of maximizing non-negative, monotone, stochastic submodular functions under cardinality constraint. Recent works have explored continuous optimization algorithms via multi-linear extensions for such problems and provided appropriate approximation guarantees. We take a fresh look into this problem from a discrete, (stochastic) greedy perspective under a probably approximately correct (PAC) setting, i.e., the goal is to obtain solutions whose expected objective value is greater than or equal to $(1-1/e-\\epsilon){\\rm OPT}-\\nu$ with at least $1-\\delta$ probability, where ${\\rm OPT}$ is the optimal objective value. Using the theory of multi-armed bandits, we propose novel bandit stochastic greedy (BSG) algorithms in which selection of the next element at iteration $i$ is posed as a $(\\nu_i,\\delta_i)$-PAC best-arm identification problem. Given $(\\nu,\\delta)$-PAC parameters to BSG, we formally characterize a set $\\mathcal{A}(\\nu,\\delta)$ of per-iteration policies such that any policy from this set guarantees a $(\\nu,\\delta)$-PAC solution for the stochastic submodular maximization problem using BSG. We next discuss the problem of learning a policy in $\\mathcal{A}(\\nu,\\delta)$ by minimizing the computational cost. With our learned policy, we show that BSG has lower computational cost than existing stochastic submodular maximization approaches. An interesting outcome of our analysis is the development of both linear and almost-linear time algorithms for the exemplar based clustering problem with $(1-1/e-\\epsilon)$-approximation guarantee under a PAC setting. Lastly, we also study the problem of learning a policy for BSG under budget setting. Experiments on various problems illustrate the efficacy of our approach in terms of optimization quality as well as computational efficiency",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Risk-sensitive reinforcement learning (RL) has garnered significant attention in recent years due to the growing interest in deploying RL agents in real-world scenarios. A critical aspect of risk awareness involves modelling highly rare risk events (rewards) that could potentially lead to catastrophic outcomes. These infrequent occurrences present a formidable challenge for data-driven methods aiming to capture such risky events accurately. While risk-aware RL techniques do exist, they suffer from high variance estimation due to the inherent data scarcity. Our work proposes to enhance the resilience of RL agents when faced with very rare and risky events by focusing on refining the predictions of the extreme values predicted by the state-action value distribution. To achieve this, we formulate the extreme values of the state-action value function distribution as parameterized distributions, drawing inspiration from the principles of extreme value theory (EVT). We propose an extreme value theory based actor-critic approach, namely, Extreme Valued Actor-Critic (EVAC) which effectively addresses the issue of infrequent occurrence by leveraging EVT-based parameterization. Importantly, we theoretically demonstrate the advantages of employing these parameterized distributions in contrast to other risk-averse algorithms. Our evaluations show that the proposed method outperforms other risk averse RL algorithms on a diverse range of benchmark tasks, each encompassing distinct risk scenarios",

    "abstract": "Constraint-based methods and noise-based methods are two distinct families of methods proposed for uncovering causal graphs from observational data. However, both operate under strong assumptions that may be challenging to validate or could be violated in real-world scenarios. In response to these challenges, there is a growing interest in hybrid methods that amalgamate principles from both methods, showing robustness to assumption violations. This paper introduces a novel comprehensive framework for hybridizing constraint-based and noise-based methods designed to uncover causal graphs from observational time series. The framework is structured into two classes. The first class employs a noise-based strategy to identify a super graph, containing the true graph, followed by a constraint-based strategy to eliminate unnecessary edges. In the second class, a constraint-based strategy is applied to identify a skeleton, which is then oriented using a noise-based strategy. The paper provides theoretical guarantees for each class under the condition that all assumptions are satisfied, and it outlines some properties when assumptions are violated. To validate the efficacy of the framework, two algorithms from each class are experimentally tested on simulated data, realistic ecological data, and real datasets sourced from diverse applications. Notably, two novel datasets related to Information Technology monitoring are introduced within the set of considered real datasets. The experimental results underscore the robustness and effectiveness of the hybrid approaches across a broad spectrum of datasets",

Current research on VFL focuses on the case when samples are independent, but it rarely addresses an emerging scenario when samples are interrelated through a graph. In this work, we train a graph neural network (GNN) through VFL, where each client owns a part of the node features and a different edge set. This data scenario incurs a significant communication overhead, not only because of the handling of distributed features but also due to neighborhood aggregation in a GNN. Moreover, the training analysis is faced with a challenge caused by the biased stochastic gradients. We propose a model-splitting method that splits a backbone GNN across the clients and the server and a communication-efficient algorithm, GLASU, to train such a model. GLASU adopts lazy aggregation and stale updates to skip communication in neighborhood aggregation and in model updates, respectively, greatly reducing communication while enjoying convergence guarantees. We conduct extensive numerical experiments on real-world datasets, showing that GLASU effectively trains a GNN that matches the accuracy of centralized training, while using only a fraction of the time due to communication saving",

Specifically, we base the prior policy on an advantage-weighted conditioned generative adversarial network, which facilitates distinct mode separation, mitigating the pitfalls of out-of-distribution (OOD) actions. For further policy optimization, the reanalysis method generates high-quality imaginary data by planning with learned models for both intra-trajectory and inter-trajectory goals.

    "title": "Understanding Smoothness of Vector Gaussian Processes on Product Spaces",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Vector Gaussian processes are becoming increasingly important in machine learning and statistics, with applications to many branches of applied sciences. Recent efforts have al- lowed to understand smoothness in scalar Gaussian processes defined over manifolds as well as over product spaces involving manifolds. Under assumptions of Gaussianity and mean-square continuity, the smoothness of a zero- mean scalar process is in one-to-one correspondence with the smoothness of the covariance kernel. Unfortunately, such a result is not available for vector-valued random fields, as the way each component in the covariance kernel contributes to the smoothness of the vector field is unclear. This paper challenges the problem of quantifying smoothness of matrix-valued continuous kernels that are associated with mean-square continuous vector Gaussian processes defined over non-Euclidean product manifolds. After noting that a constructive RKHS approach is unsuitable for this specific task, we proceed through the analysis of spectral properties. Specifically, we find a spectral representation to quantify smoothness through Sobolev spaces that are adapted to certain measure spaces of product measures obtained through the ten- sor product of Haar measures with multivariate Gaussian measures. Our results allow to measure smoothness in a simple way, and open for the study of foundational properties of certain machine learning techniques over product spaces",

    "abstract": "Despite their successful application to a variety of tasks, neural networks remain limited, like other machine learning methods, by their sensitivity to shifts in the data: their performance can be severely impacted by differences in distribution between the data on which they were trained and that on which they are deployed. In this article, we propose a new family of representations, called MAGDiff, that we extract from any given neural network classifier and that allows for efficient covariate data shift detection without the need to train a new model dedicated to this task. These representations are computed by comparing the activation graphs of the neural network for samples belonging to the training distribution and to the target distribution, and yield powerful data- and task-adapted statistics for the two-sample tests commonly used for data set shift detection. We demonstrate this empirically by measuring the statistical powers of two-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) tests on several different data sets and shift types, and showing that our novel representations induce significant improvements over a state-of-the-art baseline relying on the network output",

    "abstract": "Deep active learning (AL) seeks to reduce the annotation costs required for training deep neural networks (DNNs). Often, deep AL strategies focus on instances where the predictive uncertainty of a DNN is high. Furthermore, Bayesian concepts to model uncertainty are frequently adopted. Despite considerable research, a detailed analysis of the role of uncertainty in deep AL is still missing, especially regarding aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty, both related to predictive uncertainty. This article provides an in-depth empirical study analyzing the interplay of uncertainty and deep AL in image classification. Our study investigates four hypotheses that provide an intuitive understanding of the effects of accurately estimating aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty on existing uncertainty-based AL strategies but also, in the opposite direction, the impact of uncertainty-based AL on the quality of uncertainty estimates that are needed in many applications. By analyzing these hypotheses on synthetic and real-world data, we find that accurate aleatoric estimates can even impair instance selection, while accurate epistemic estimates have negligible effects. Moreover, we provide a publicly available toolbox for deep AL with various models and strategies to facilitate further research and practical applications. Code is available at github.com/anonymous",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Graph neural networks (GNNs) drive several real-world applications including drug-discovery, recommendation engines, and chip designing. Unfortunately, GNNs are a black-box since they do not allow human-intelligible explanations of their predictions. Counterfactual reasoning is an effort to overcome this limitation. Specifically, the objective is to minimally perturb the input graph to a GNN, so that its prediction changes. While several algorithms have been proposed towards counterfactual explanations of GNNs, majority suffer from three key limitations: (1) they only consider perturbations in the form of deletions of existing edges, (2) they perform an inefficient exploration of the combinatorial search space, (3) the counterfactual explanation model is transductive in nature, i.e., they do not generalize to unseen data. In this work, we propose an inductive algorithm called InduCE, that overcomes these limitations. Through extensive experiments on graph datasets, we show that incorporating edge additions, and modelling marginal effect of perturbations aid in generating better counterfactuals among available recourse. Furthermore, inductive modeling enables InduCE to directly predict counterfactual perturbations without requiring instance-specific training. This leads to significant computational speed-up over baselines and allows counterfactual analyses for GNNs at scale",

However, despite the growing volume of literature in this field, there remains a notable absence of a unified dataset and a fair benchmark to evaluate and compare existing approaches. To address this crucial gap, we present G4SATBench, the first benchmark study that establishes a comprehensive evaluation framework for GNN-based SAT solvers. In G4SATBench, we meticulously curate a large and diverse set of SAT datasets comprising 7 problems with 3 difficulty levels and benchmark a broad range of GNN models across various prediction tasks, training objectives, and inference algorithms. To explore the learning abilities and comprehend the strengths and limitations of GNN-based SAT solvers, we also compare their solving processes with the heuristics in search-based SAT solvers. Our empirical results provide valuable insights into the performance of GNN-based SAT solvers and further suggest that existing GNN models can effectively learn a solving strategy akin to greedy local search but struggle to learn backtracking search in the latent space.

    "abstract": "Federated learning has become a popular machine learning paradigm with many potential real-life applications, including recommendation systems, the Internet of Things (IoT), healthcare, and self-driving cars. Though most current applications focus on classification-based tasks, learning personalized generative models remains largely unexplored, and their benefits in the heterogeneous setting still need to be better understood. This work proposes a novel architecture combining global client-agnostic and local client-specific generative models. We show that using standard techniques for training federated models, our proposed model achieves privacy and personalization by implicitly disentangling the globally-consistent representation (i.e. content) from the client-dependent variations (i.e. style). Using such decomposition, personalized models can generate locally unseen labels while preserving the given style of the client and can predict the labels for all clients with high accuracy by training a simple linear classifier on the global content features. Furthermore, disentanglement enables other essential applications, such as data anonymization, by sharing only the content. Extensive experimental evaluation corroborates our findings, and we also discuss a theoretical motivation for the proposed approach",

    "abstract": "Previous studies have demonstrated that not each sample in a dataset is of equal importance during training. Data pruning aims to remove less important or informative samples while still achieving comparable results as training on the original (untruncated) dataset, thereby reducing storage and training costs. However, the majority of data pruning methods are applied to image classification tasks. To our knowledge, this work is the first to explore the feasibility of these pruning methods applied to object re-identification (ReID) tasks, while also presenting a more comprehensive data pruning approach. By fully leveraging the logit history during training, our approach offers a more accurate and comprehensive metric for quantifying sample importance, as well as correcting mislabeled samples and recognizing outliers. Furthermore, our approach is highly efficient, reducing the cost of importance score estimation by 10 times compared to existing methods. Our approach is a plug-and-play, architecture-agnostic framework that can eliminate/reduce 35%, 30%, and 5% of samples/training time on the VeRi, MSMT17 and Market1501 datasets, respectively, with negligible loss in accuracy (< 0.1%).

In contrast, it is easy to access large repositories of suboptimal offline trajectories. Inspired by research in offline reinforcement learning (ORL), we introduce a new problem setup of VLN-ORL which studies VLN using suboptimal demonstration data. We introduce a simple and effective reward-conditioned approach that can account for dataset suboptimality for training VLN agents, as well as benchmarks to evaluate progress and promote research in this area. We empirically study various noise models for characterizing dataset suboptimality among other unique challenges in VLN-ORL and instantiate it for the VLN⟳BERT and MTVM architectures in the R2R and RxR environments.

    "title": "Offline Reinforcement Learning via Tsallis Regularization",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Offline reinforcement learning (RL) focuses on learning a good policy from a fixed dataset. The dataset is generated by an unknown behavior policy through interactions with the environment and contains only a subset of the state-action spaces. Standard off-policy algorithms often perform poorly in this setting, suffering from errorneously optimistic values incurred by the out-of-distribution (OOD) actions not present in the dataset. The optimisim cannot be corrected as no further interaction with the environment is possible. Imposing divergence regularization and in-sample constraints are among the most popular methods to overcoming the issue by ensuring that the learned policy stays close to the behavior policy to minimize the occurrence of OOD actions. This paper proposes Tsallis regularization for offline RL, which aligns the induced sparsemax policies to the in-sample constraint. Sparsemax interpolates existing methods utilizing hard-max and softmax policies, in that only a subset of actions contributes non-zero action probability as compared to softmax (all actions) and hard-max (single action). We leverage this property to model the behavior policy and show that under several assumptions the learned sparsemax policies may have sparsity-conditional KL divergence to the behavior policy, making Tsallis regularization especially suitable for the Behavior Cloning methods. We propose a novel actor-critic algorithm: Tsallis Advantage Weighted Actor-Critic (Tsallis AWAC) generalizing AWAC and analyze its performance in standard Mujoco environments.

These crafted inputs, imperceptible to humans, can manipulate machine learning models into making erroneous predictions, raising concerns for safety-critical applications. An intriguing property of this phenomenon is the transferability of adversarial examples, where perturbations crafted for one model can deceive another, often with a different architecture. This intriguing property enables ``black-box'' attacks which circumvents the need for detailed knowledge of the target model. This survey explores the landscape of the adversarial transferability of adversarial examples. We categorize existing methodologies to enhance adversarial transferability and discuss the fundamental principles guiding each approach.

These methods unroll the optimization iterations into a sequence of neural networks that in effect learn a regularization function from data. While these architectures are currently state-of-the-art in numerous applications, their success heavily relies on the accuracy of the forward model. This assumption can be limiting in many physical applications due to model simplifications or uncertainties in the apparatus. To address forward model mismatch, we introduce an untrained forward model residual block within the model-based architecture to match the data consistency in the measurement domain for each instance. We propose two variants in well-known model-based architectures (LU and DEQ) and prove convergence under mild conditions. Our approach offers a unified solution that is less parameter-sensitive, requires no additional data, and enables simultaneous fitting of the forward model and reconstruction in a single pass, benefiting both linear and nonlinear inverse problems. The experiments show significant quality improvement in removing artifacts and preserving details across three distinct applications, encompassing both linear and nonlinear inverse problems. Moreover, we highlight reconstruction effectiveness in intermediate steps and showcase robustness to random initialization of the residual block and a higher number of iterations during evaluation",

This work designs a novel mathematical model that effectively allows the clients to aggregate distributed data with heterogeneous, and possibly overlapping features and samples. Our main idea is to partition each client's model into a feature extractor part and a classifier part, where the former can be used to process the input data, while the latter is used to perform the learning from the extracted features. The heterogeneous feature aggregation is done through building a server model, which assimilates local classifiers and feature extractors through a carefully designed matching mechanism. A communication-efficient algorithm is then designed to train both the client and server models. Finally, we conducted numerical experiments on multiple image classification data sets to validate the performance of the proposed algorithm.

Recent PaI studies showed that random pruning is more effective than ranking-based pruning, which learns connectivity. However, the effectiveness of each pruning method depends on the existence of skip connections and the compression ratio (the before-after pruning parameter ratio). While random pruning performs better than ranking-based pruning on architectures with skip connections, the superiority without skip connections is reversed in the high compression range. This paper proposes Minimum Connection Assurance (MiCA) that achieves higher accuracy than conventional PaI methods for architectures with and without skip connections, regardless of the compression ratio. MiCA preserves the random connection between the layers and maintains the performance at high compression ratios without the costly connection learning that ranking-based pruning requires. Experiments on image classification using CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 and node classification using OGBN-ArXiv show that MiCA enhances the compression ratio and accuracy trade-offs compared to existing PaI methods. In VGG-16 with CIFAR-10, MiCA improves the accuracy of random pruning by $27.0\\%$ at $10^{4.7}\\times$ compression ratio. Furthermore, experimental analysis reveals that increasing the utilization of the nodes through which information flows from the first layer is essential for maintaining high performance at a high compression ratio",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "We focus on the problem of learning without forgetting from multiple tasks arriving sequentially, where each task is defined using a few-shot episode of novel or already seen classes. We approach this problem using the recently published HyperTransformer (HT), a Transformer-based hypernetwork that generates specialized task-specific CNN weights directly from the support set. In order to learn from a continual sequence of tasks, we propose to recursively re-use the generated weights as input to the HT for the next task. This way, the generated CNN weights themselves act as a representation of previously learned tasks, and the HT is trained to update these weights so that the new task can be learned without forgetting past tasks. This approach is different from most continual learning algorithms that typically rely on using replay buffers, weight regularization or task-dependent architectural changes. We demonstrate that our proposed Continual HyperTransformer method equipped with a prototypical loss is capable of learning and retaining knowledge about past tasks for a variety of scenarios, including learning from mini-batches, and task-incremental and class-incremental learning scenarios",

    "title": "Federated Learning with Convex Global and Local Constraints",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "In practice, many machine learning (ML) problems come with constraints, and their applied domains involve distributed sensitive data that cannot be shared with others, e.g., in healthcare. Collaborative learning in such practical scenarios entails federated learning (FL) for ML problems with constraints, or FL with constraints for short. Despite the extensive developments of FL techniques in recent years, these techniques only deal with unconstrained FL problems or FL problems with simple constraints that are amenable to easy projections. There is little work dealing with FL problems with general constraints. To fill this gap, we take the first step toward building an algorithmic framework for solving FL problems with general constraints. In particular, we propose a new FL algorithm for constrained ML problems based on the proximal augmented Lagrangian (AL) method. %The subproblems of our proposed algorithm are solved by an inexact alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM). Assuming convex objective and convex constraints plus other mild conditions, we establish the worst-case complexity of the proposed algorithm. Our numerical experiments show the effectiveness of our algorithm in performing Neyman-Pearson classification and fairness-aware learning with nonconvex constraints, in an FL setting",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Recent works extend classification group fairness measures to sequential decision processes such as reinforcement learning (RL) by measuring fairness as the difference in decision-maker utility (e.g. accuracy) of each group. This approach suffers when decision-maker utility is not perfectly aligned with group utility, such as in repeat loan applications where a false positive (loan default) impacts the groups (applicants) and decision-maker (lender) by different magnitudes. Some works remedy this by measuring fairness in terms of group utility, typically referred to as their \"qualification\", but few works offer solutions that yield group qualification equality. Those that do are prone to violating the \"no-harm\" principle where one or more groups' qualifications are lowered in order to achieve equality. In this work, we characterize this problem space as having three implicit objectives: maximizing decision-maker utility, maximizing group qualification, and minimizing the difference in qualification between groups. We provide a RL policy learning technique that optimizes for these objectives directly by constructing a multi-objective reward function that encodes these objectives as distinct reward signals. Under suitable parameterizations our approach is guaranteed to respect the \"no-harm\" principle",

In this paper, we show that the excellent robustness and versatility of recent pretrained models challenge common practices established in the literature, calling for a new set of optimal guidelines for task-specific distillation. To address the lack of samples in downstream tasks, we also show that a variant of Mixup based on stable diffusion complements standard data augmentation.

We show that these methods can be generalized easily to any basis expansion model and that using alternative basis expansions, such as Hilbert space Gaussian processes, often results in better performance. To simplify the process of choosing a specific basis expansion, our method's generality also allows the ensembling of several entirely different models, for example, a Gaussian process and polynomial regression.

Although rehearsal-based approaches have been fairly successful in mitigating catastrophic forgetting, they suffer from overfitting on buffered samples and prior information loss, hindering generalization under low-buffer regimes. Inspired by how humans learn using strong inductive biases, we propose \\textbf{IMEX-Reg} to improve the generalization performance of experience rehearsal in CL under low buffer regimes. Specifically, we employ a two-pronged implicit-explicit regularization approach using contrastive representation learning (CRL) and consistency regularization. To further leverage the global relationship between representations learned using CRL, we propose a regularization strategy to guide the classifier toward the activation correlations in the unit hypersphere of the CRL. Our results show that IMEX-Reg significantly improves generalization performance and outperforms rehearsal-based approaches in several CL scenarios. It is also robust to natural and adversarial corruptions with less task-recency bias. Additionally, we provide theoretical insights to support our design decisions further",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "The availability of abundant data has catalyzed the expansion of deep learning vision algorithms. However, certain vision datasets cannot be publicly released due to privacy reasons. Releasing synthetic images instead of private images is a common approach to overcome this issue. A popular method to generate synthetic images is using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) with Differential Privacy (DP) guarantees. However, GAN-generated synthetic images are visually similar to private images. This is a severe limitation, particularly when the private dataset depicts visually sensitive and disturbing content. To address this, we propose a non-generative framework, Differentially Private Image Synthesis (DP-ImgSyn), to generate and release synthetic images for image classification tasks. These synthetic images: (1) have DP guarantees, (2) retain the utility of the private images, i.e., a model trained using synthetic images results in similar accuracy as a model trained on private images, (3) the synthetic images are visually dissimilar to private images. DP-ImgSyn consists of the following steps: First, a teacher model is trained on the private images using a DP training algorithm. Second, public images are used as initialization for the synthetic images which are optimized to align them with the private images. The optimization uses the teacher network's batch normalization layer statistics (mean, standard deviation) to inject information about the private images into the synthetic images. Third, the synthetic images and their soft labels, obtained from the teacher model, are released and can be deployed for neural network training on image classification tasks. Our experiments on various image classification datasets show that when using similar DP training mechanisms, our framework performs better than generative techniques (up to $\\approx$ 20% in terms of image classification accuracy)",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Visual reasoning is dominated by end-to-end neural networks scaled to billions of model parameters and training examples. However, even the largest models struggle with compositional reasoning, generalization, fine-grained spatial and temporal reasoning, and counting. Visual reasoning with large language models (LLMs) as controllers can, in principle, address these limitations by decomposing the task and solving subtasks by orchestrating a set of (visual) tools. Recently, these models achieved great performance on tasks such as compositional visual question answering, visual grounding, and video temporal reasoning. Nevertheless, in their current form, these models heavily rely on human engineering of in-context examples in the prompt, which are often dataset- and task-specific and require significant labor by highly skilled programmers. In this work, we present a framework that mitigates these issues by introducing spatially and temporally abstract routines and by leveraging a small number of labeled examples to automatically generate in-context examples, thereby avoiding human-created in-context examples. On a number of visual reasoning tasks, we show that our framework leads to consistent gains in performance, makes LLMs as controllers setup more robust, and removes the need for human engineering of in-context examples",

Through a fine-grained bifurcation analysis concerning the step-size parameter, we delineate five distinct training phases: (1) monotonic, (2) catapult, (3) periodic, (4) chaotic, and (5) divergent, precisely demarcating the boundaries of each phase. As illustrations, we provide examples involving phase retrieval and two-layer neural networks employing quadratic activation functions and constant outer-layers, utilizing orthogonal training data. Our simulations indicate that these five phases also manifest with generic non-orthogonal data. We also empirically investigate the generalization performance when training in the various non-monotonic (and non-divergent) phases.

Among the established evaluation criteria, the Fréchet Inception Distance (FID) has been widely adopted due to its conceptual simplicity, fast computation time, and strong correlation with human perception. However, FID has inherent limitations, mainly stemming from its assumption that feature embeddings follow a Gaussian distribution, and therefore can be defined by their first two moments. As this does not hold in practice, in this paper we explore the importance of third-moments in image feature data and use this information to define a new measure, which we call the Skew Inception Distance (SID). We prove that SID is a pseudometric on probability distributions, show how it extends FID, and present a practical method for its computation. Our numerical experiments support that SID either tracks with FID or, in some cases, aligns more closely with human perception when evaluating image features of ImageNet data. Our work also shows that principal component analysis can be used to speed up the computation time of both FID and SID. Although we focus on using SID on image features for GAN evaluation, SID is applicable much more generally, including for the evaluation of other generative models",

    "abstract": "In supervised learning — for instance in image classification — modern massive datasets are commonly labeled by a crowd of workers. The obtained labels in this crowdsourcing setting are then aggregated for training, generally leveraging a per-worker trust score. Yet, such workers oriented approaches discard the tasks' ambiguity. Ambiguous tasks might fool expert workers, which is often harmful for the learning step. In standard supervised learning settings -- with one label per task -- the Area Under the Margin (AUM) was tailored to identify mislabeled data. We adapt the AUM to identify ambiguous tasks in crowdsourced learning scenarios, introducing the Weighted Areas Under the Margin (WAUM). The WAUM is an average of AUMs weighted according to task-dependent scores. We show that the WAUM can help discarding ambiguous tasks from the training set, leading to better generalization performance. We report improvements over existing strategies for learning with a crowd, both on simulated settings, and on real datasets such as CIFAR-10H (a crowdsourced dataset with a high number of answered labels), LabelMe and Music (two datasets with few answered votes)",

Here, in contrast, we propose to represent style as a dense feature map, allowing for a finer-grained transfer to the source image without requiring any external semantic information. We then rely on perceptual and adversarial losses to disentangle our dense style and content representations. To stylize the source content with the exemplar style, we extract unsupervised cross-domain semantic correspondences and warp the exemplar style to the source content. We demon- strate the effectiveness of our method on four datasets using standard metrics together with a localized style metric we propose, which measures style similarity in a class-wise man- ner.

    "abstract": "Scene text editing is a challenging task that involves modifying or inserting specified texts in an image while maintaining its natural and realistic appearance. Most previous approaches to this task rely on style-transfer models that crop out text regions and feed them into image transfer models, such as GANs. However, these methods are limited in their ability to change text style and are unable to insert texts into images. Recent advances in diffusion models have shown promise in overcoming these limitations with text-conditional image editing. However, our empirical analysis reveals that state-of-the-art diffusion models struggle with rendering correct text and controlling text style. To address these problems, we propose DIFFSTE to improve pre-trained diffusion models with a dual encoder design, which includes a character encoder for better text legibility and an instruction encoder for better style control. An instruction tuning framework is introduced to train our model to learn the mapping from the text instruction to the corresponding image with either the specified style or the style of the surrounding texts in the background. Such a training method further brings our method the zero-shot generalization ability to the following three scenarios: generating text with unseen font variation, e.g., italic and bold, mixing different fonts to construct a new font, and using more relaxed forms of natural language as the instructions to guide the generation task. We evaluate our approach on five datasets and demonstrate its superior performance in terms of text correctness, image naturalness, and style controllability",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "In the real world, the data samples often follow a long-tailed distribution, which poses a great challenge for Federated Learning (FL). That is, when the data is decentralized and long-tailed, FL may produce a poorly-behaved global model that is severely biased towards the head classes with the majority of the training samples. To settle this issue, decoupled training has recently been introduced to FL. Decoupled training aims to re-balance the biased classifier after the normal instance-balanced training, and has achieved promising results in centralized long-tailed learning. The current study directly adopts the decoupled training idea on the server side by re-training the classifier on a set of pseudo features, due to the unavailability of a global balanced dataset in FL. Unfortunately, this practice restricts the capacity of decoupled training in federated long-tailed learning as the low-quality pseudo features lead to a sub-optimal classifier. In this work, motivated by the distributed characteristic of FL, we propose a decentralized decoupled training mechanism by leveraging the abundant real data stored in the local. Specifically, we integrate the local real data with the global gradient prototypes to form the local balanced datasets, and thus re-balance the classifier during the local training. Furthermore, we introduce a supplementary classifier in the training phase to help model the global data distribution, which addresses the problem of contradictory optimization goals caused by performing classifier re-balancing locally. Extensive experiments show that our method consistently outperforms the existing state-of-the-art methods in various settings.

    "abstract": "Federated learning (FL) is an emerging paradigm in machine learning, where a shared model is collaboratively learned using data from multiple devices to mitigate the risk of data leakage. While recent studies posit that Vision Transformer (ViT) outperforms Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) in addressing data heterogeneity in FL, the specific architectural components that underpin this advantage have yet to be elucidated. In this paper, we systematically investigate the impact of different architectural elements, such as activation functions and normalization layers, on the performance within heterogeneous FL. Through rigorous empirical analyses, we are able to offer the first-of-its-kind general guidance on micro-architecture design principles for heterogeneous FL. Intriguingly, our findings indicate that with strategic architectural modifications, pure CNNs can achieve a level of robustness that either matches or even exceeds that of ViTs when handling heterogeneous data clients in FL. Additionally, our approach is compatible with existing FL techniques and delivers state-of-the-art solutions across a broad spectrum of FL benchmarks",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Pruning-at-Initialization (PaI) algorithms provide Sparse Neural Networks (SNNs) which are computationally more efficient than their dense counterparts, and try to avoid performance degradation. While much emphasis has been directed towards \\emph{how} to prune, we still do not know \\emph{what topological metrics} of the SNNs characterize \\emph{good performance}. From prior work, we have layer-wise topological metrics by which SNN performance can be predicted: the Ramanujan-based metrics. To exploit these metrics, proper ways to represent network layers via Graph Encodings (GEs) are needed, with Bipartite Graph Encodings (BGEs) being the \\emph{de-facto} standard at the current stage. Nevertheless, existing BGEs neglect the impact of the inputs, and do not characterize the SNN in an end-to-end manner. Additionally, thanks to a thorough study of the Ramanujan-based metrics, we discover that they are only as good as the \\emph{layer-wise density} as performance predictors, when paired with BGEs. To close both gaps, we design a comprehensive topological analysis for SNNs with both linear and convolutional layers, via (i) a new input-aware Multipartite Graph Encoding (MGE) for SNNs and (ii) the design of new end-to-end topological metrics over the MGE. With these novelties, we show the following: (a) The proposed MGE allows to extract topological metrics that are much better predictors of the accuracy drop than metrics computed from current input-agnostic BGEs; (b) Which metrics are important at different sparsity levels and for different architectures; (c) A mixture of our topological metrics can rank PaI algorithms more effectively than Ramanujan-based metrics",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Motivated by programmatic advertising optimization, we consider the task of sequentially allocating budget across a set of resources. At every time step, a feasible allocation is chosen and only a corresponding random return is observed. The goal is to maximize the cumulative expected sum of returns. This is a realistic model for budget allocation across subdivisions of marketing campaigns, with the objective of maximizing the number of conversions. We study direct search (also known as pattern search) methods for linearly constrained and derivative-free optimization in the presence of noise, which apply in particular to sequential budget allocation. These algorithms, which do not rely on hierarchical partitioning of the resource space, are easy to implement; they respect the operational constraints of resource allocation by avoiding evaluation outside of the feasible domain; and, they are also compatible with warm start by being (approximate) descent algorithms. However, they have not yet been analyzed from the perspective of cumulative regret. We show that direct search methods achieves finite regret in the deterministic and unconstrained case. In the presence of evaluation noise and linear constraints, we propose a simple extension of direct search that achieves a regret upper-bound of the order of $T^{2/3}$. We also propose an accelerated version of the algorithm, relying on repeated sequential testing, that significantly improves the practical behavior of the approach",

A key component of MoEs is the router, which decides which subset of parameters (experts) process which feature embeddings (tokens). In this paper, we present a comprehensive study of routers in MoEs for computer vision tasks. We introduce a unified MoE formulation that subsumes different MoEs with two parametric routing tensors. This formulation covers both sparse MoE, which uses a binary or hard assignment between experts and tokens, and soft MoE, which uses a soft assignment between experts and weighted combinations of tokens. Routers for sparse MoEs can be further grouped into two variants: Token Choice, which matches experts to each token, and Expert Choice, which matches tokens to each expert. We conduct head-to-head experiments with 6 different routers, including existing routers from prior work and new ones we introduce. We show that (i) many routers originally developed for language modeling can be adapted to perform strongly in vision tasks, (ii) in sparse MoE, Expert Choice routers generally outperform Token Choice routers, and (iii) soft MoEs generally outperform sparse MoEs with a fixed compute budget. These results provide new insights regarding the crucial role of routers in vision MoE models",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Compressive learning is an emerging approach to drastically reduce the memory footprint of large-scale learning, by first summarizing a large dataset into a low-dimensional sketch vector, and then decoding from this sketch the latent information needed for learning. In light of recent progress on information preservation guarantees for sketches based on random features, a major objective is to design easy-to-tune algorithms (called decoders) to robustly and efficiently extract this information. To address the underlying non-convex optimization problems, various heuristics have been proposed. In the case of compressive clustering, the standard heuristic is CL-OMPR, a variant of sliding Frank-Wolfe. Yet, CL-OMPR is hard to tune, and the examination of its robustness was overlooked. In this work, we undertake a scrutinized examination of CL-OMPR to circumvent its limitations. In particular, we show how this algorithm can fail to recover the clusters even in advantageous scenarios. To gain insight, we show how the deficiencies of this algorithm can be attributed to optimization difficulties related to the structure of a correlation function appearing at core steps of the algorithm. To address these limitations, we propose an alternative decoder offering substantial improvements over CL-OMPR. Its design is notably inspired from the mean shift algorithm, a classic approach to detect the local maxima of kernel density estimators. The proposed algorithm can extract clustering information from a sketch of the MNIST dataset that is 10 times smaller than previously",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Real-world problems often involve complex and unstructured sets of measurements, which occurs when sensors are sparsely placed in either space or time. Being able to model this irregular spatiotemporal data and extract meaningful forecasts is crucial. Deep learning architectures capable of processing sets of measurements with positions varying from set to set, and extracting readouts anywhere are methodologically difficult. Current state-of-the-art models are graph neural networks and require domain-specific knowledge for proper setup. We propose an attention-based model focused on robustness and practical applicability, with two key design contributions. First, we adopt a ViT-like transformer that takes both context points and read-out positions as inputs, eliminating the need for an encoder-decoder structure. Second, we use a unified method for encoding both context and read-out positions. This approach is intentionally straightforward and integrates well with other systems. Compared to existing approaches, our model is simpler, requires less specialized knowledge, and does not suffer from a problematic bottleneck effect, all of which contribute to superior performance. We conduct in-depth ablation studies that characterize this problematic bottleneck in the latent representations of alternative models that inhibit information utilization and impede training efficiency. We also perform experiments across various problem domains, including high-altitude wind nowcasting, two-day weather forecasting, fluid dynamics, and heat diffusion. Our attention-based model consistently outperforms state-of-the-art models in handling irregularly sampled data. Notably, our model reduces the root mean square error (RMSE) for wind nowcasting from 9.24 to 7.98 and for heat diffusion tasks from 0.126 to 0.084",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Self-supervised learning algorithms (SSL) based on instance discrimination have shown promising results, performing competitively or even outperforming supervised learning counterparts in some downstream tasks. Such approaches employ data augmentation to create two views of the same instance (i.e., positive pairs) and encourage the model to learn good representations by attracting these views closer in the embedding space without collapsing to the trivial solution. However, data augmentation is limited in representing positive pairs, and the repulsion process between the instances during contrastive learning may discard important features for instances that have similar categories. To address this issue, we propose an approach to identify those images with similar semantic content and treat them as positive instances, thereby reducing the chance of discarding important features during representation learning and increasing the richness of the latent representation. Our approach is generic and could work with any self-supervised instance discrimination frameworks such as MoCo and SimSiam. To evaluate our method, we run experiments on three benchmark datasets: ImageNet, STL-10 and CIFAR-10 with different instance discrimination SSL approaches. The experimental results show that our approach consistently outperforms the baseline methods across all three datasets; for instance, we improve upon the vanilla MoCo-v2 by 4.1% on ImageNet under a linear evaluation protocol over 800 epochs. We also report results on semi-supervised learning, transfer learning on downstream tasks, and object detection",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "The success of modern neural networks has prompted study of the connection between memorisation and generalisation: overparameterised models generalise well, despite being able to perfectly fit (\"memorise\") completely random labels. To carefully study this issue, Feldman (2019) proposed a metric to quantify the degree of memorisation of individual training examples, and empirically computed the corresponding memorisation profile of a ResNet on image classification benchmarks. While an exciting first glimpse into what real-world models memorise, this leaves open a fundamental question: do larger neural models memorise more? This aligns with the common practice of training models of different sizes, each offering different cost-quality trade-offs: while larger models are typically observed to have higher quality, it is of interest to understand whether this is merely a consequence of them memorising larger numbers of input-output patterns. We present a comprehensive empirical analysis of this question on image classification benchmarks. We find that training examples exhibit an unexpectedly diverse set of memorisation trajectories across model sizes: most samples experienced decreased memorisation under larger models, while the rest exhibit cap-shaped or increasing memorisation. We show that various proxies for the Feldman(2019) memorisation score fail to capture these fundamental trends. Lastly, we find that knowledge distillation — an effective and popular model compression technique — tends to inhibit memorisation, while also improving generalisation. Specifically, memorisation is mostly inhibited on examples with increasing memorisation trajectories, thus pointing at how distillation improves generalisation",

If this search does not produce a solution, Aulile enhances the language with a library of programs discovered in the search that optimizes for the auxiliary function. Then, it repeats the search with this library-augmented language. This process is repeated until a solution is found or the system reaches a timeout. We evaluate Aulile in string manipulation tasks. Aulile improved, in some cases by a large margin, the performance of several base algorithms that use different search and learning strategies: Bus, Bustle, Crossbeam, and Bee Search.

Fooling master images are capable of maximizing the confidence score of a CLIP model for a significant number of widely varying prompts, while being either unrecognizable or unrelated to the attacked prompts for humans. We demonstrate how fooling master images can be mined using stochastic gradient descent, projected gradient descent, or gradient-free optimisation. Contrary to many common adversarial attacks, the gradient-free optimisation approach allows us to mine fooling examples even when the weights of the model are not accessible. We investigate the properties of the mined fooling master images, and find that images trained on a small number of image captions potentially generalize to a much larger number of semantically related captions. Finally, we evaluate possible mitigation strategies and find that vulnerability to fooling master examples appears to be closely related to a modality gap in contrastive pre-trained multi-modal networks",

    "abstract": "Regulators, researchers, and practitioners recognize the urgency of explainability in artificial intelligence systems, including the ones based on machine learning for graph-structured data. Despite the large number of proposals, however, a common understanding of what constitutes a good explanation is still lacking: different explainers often arrive at different conclusions on the same problem instance, making it hard for practitioners to choose among them. Furthermore, explainers often produce explanations through opaque logic hard to understand and assess -- ironically mirroring the black box nature they aim to elucidate. Recent proposals in the literature for benchmarking graph-based explainers typically involve embedding specific logic into data, training a black-box model, and then empirically assessing how well the explanation matches the embedded logic, i.e., they test truthfulness to the data. In contrast, we propose a true-to-the-model axiomatic framework for auditing explainers in the task of node classification on graphs. Our proposal hinges on the fundamental idea that an explainer should discern if a model relies on a particular feature for classifying a node. Building on this concept, we develop three types of white-box classifiers, with clear internal logic, that are relevant in real-world applications. We then formally prove that the set of features that can induce a change in the classification correctly corresponds to a ground-truth set of predefined important features. This property allows us to use the white-box classifiers to build a testing framework. We apply this framework to both synthetic and real data and evaluate various state-of-the-art explainers, thus characterizing their behavior. Our findings highlight how explainers often react in a rather counter-intuitive fashion to technical details that might be easily overlooked. Our approach offers valuable insights and recommended practices for selecting the right explainer given the task at hand, and for developing new methods for explaining graph-learning models",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Whereas the ability of deep networks to produce useful predictions on many kinds of data has been amply demonstrated, estimating the reliability of these predictions remains challenging. Sampling approaches such as MC-Dropout and Deep Ensembles have emerged as the most popular ones for this purpose. Unfortunately, they require many forward passes at inference time, which slows them down. Sampling-free approaches can be faster but often suffer from other drawbacks, such as lower reliability of uncertainty estimates, difficulty of use, and limited applicability to different types of tasks and data. In this work, we introduce a sampling-free approach that is generic and easy to deploy, while producing reliable uncertainty estimates on par with state-of-the-art methods at a significantly lower computational cost. It is predicated on training the network to produce the same output with and without additional information about it. At inference time, when no prior information is given, we use the network's own prediction as the additional information. We then take the distance between the predictions with and without prior information as our uncertainty measure. We demonstrate our approach on several classification and regression tasks. We show that it delivers results on par with those of Ensembles but at a much lower computational cost",

Besides, existing analyses primarily focus on single-head attention. Inspired by the demonstrated benefits of overparameterization when training fully-connected networks, we investigate the potential optimization and generalization advantages of using multiple attention heads. Towards this goal, we derive convergence and generalization guarantees for gradient-descent training of a single-layer multi-head self-attention model, under a suitable realizability condition on the data. We then establish primitive conditions on the initialization that ensure realizability holds. Finally, we demonstrate that these conditions are satisfied for a simple tokenized-mixture model.

To bridge the gap between the assumption of a shared subspace and the more realistic situation of client-specific spaces, we propose a general framework coined FLIC that maps client's data onto a common feature space via local embedding functions, in a federated manner. Preservation of class information in the latent space is ensured by a distribution alignment with respect to a learned reference distribution. We provide the algorithmic details of FLIC as well as theoretical insights supporting the relevance of our methodology.

However, these models may tend to overfit the fine-tuning data, resulting in over-confident predictions on test data that fall outside of the training distribution. To address this issue, uncertainty quantification (UQ) methods can be used to improve the models' calibration of predictions. Although many UQ approaches exist, not all of them lead to improved performance. While some studies have included UQ to improve molecular pre-trained models, the process of selecting suitable backbone and UQ methods for reliable molecular uncertainty estimation remains underexplored. To address this gap, we present MUBen, which evaluates different UQ methods for state-of-the-art backbone molecular representation models to investigate their capabilities. By fine-tuning various backbones using different molecular descriptors as inputs with UQ methods from different categories, we assess the influence of architectural decisions and training strategies on property prediction and uncertainty estimation. Our study offers insights for selecting UQ for backbone models, which can facilitate research on uncertainty-critical applications in fields such as materials science and drug discovery",

However, training such models usually requires large amounts of clean signals which are often difficult or impossible to obtain. In this work, we propose a novel training technique for generative diffusion models based only on corrupted data. We introduce a loss function based on the Generalized Stein's Unbiased Risk Estimator (GSURE), and prove that under some conditions, it is equivalent to the training objective used in fully supervised diffusion models. We demonstrate our technique on face images as well as Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), where the use of undersampled data significantly alleviates data collection costs. Our approach achieves generative performance comparable to its fully supervised counterpart without training on any clean signals. In addition, we deploy the resulting diffusion model in various downstream tasks beyond the degradation present in the training set, showcasing promising results",

However, research on LLM watermarking often relies on simple perplexity or diversity-based measures to assess the quality of watermarked text, which can mask important limitations in watermarking. Here we introduce two new easy-to-use methods for evaluating watermarking algorithms for LLMs: 1) evaluation by LLM-judger with specific guidelines; and 2) binary classification on text embeddings to distinguish between watermarked and unwatermarked text. We apply these methods to characterize the effectiveness of current watermarking techniques. Our experiments, conducted across various datasets, reveal that current watermarking methods are moderately detectable by even simple classifiers, challenging the notion of watermarking subtlety. We also found, through the LLM judger, that watermarking impacts text quality, especially in degrading the coherence and depth of the response. Our findings underscore the trade-off between watermark robustness and text quality and highlight the importance of having more informative metrics to assess watermarking quality",

    "title": "Does Representation Similarity Capture Function Similarity?",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Representation similarity metrics are widely used to compare learned representations in neural networks, as is evident in extensive literature investigating metrics that accurately capture information encoded in representations. However, aiming to capture all of the information available in representations may have little to do with what information is actually used by the downstream network. One solution is to experiment with interventions on network function. By ablating groups of units thought to carry information and observing whether those ablations affect network performance, we can focus on an outcome that mechanistically links representations to function. In this paper, we systematically test representation similarity metrics to evaluate their sensitivity to functional changes induced by ablation. We use network performance changes after ablation as a way to measure the influence of representation on function. These measures of function allow us to test how well similarity metrics capture changes in network performance versus changes to linear decodability. Network performance measures index the information used by the downstream network, while linear decoding methods index available information in the representation. We show that all of the tested metrics are more sensitive to decodable features than network performance. When comparing these metrics, Procrustes and CKA outperform regularized CCA-based methods on average. Although Procrustes and CKA outperform on average, these metrics have a diminished advantage when looking at network performance. We provide ablation tests of the utility of different representational similarity metrics. Our results suggest that interpretability methods will be more effective if they are based on representational similarity metrics that have been evaluated using ablation tests",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Recent works demonstrate a remarkable ability to customize text-to-image diffusion models while only providing a few example images. What happens if you try to customize such models using multiple, fine-grained concepts in a sequential (i.e., continual) manner? In our work, we show that recent state-of-the-art customization of text-to-image models suffer from catastrophic forgetting when new concepts arrive sequentially. Specifically, when adding a new concept, the ability to generate high quality images of past, similar concepts degrade. To circumvent this forgetting, we propose a new method, C-LoRA, composed of a continually self-regularized low-rank adaptation in cross attention layers of the popular Stable Diffusion model. Furthermore, we use customization prompts which do not include the word of the customized object (i.e., \"person\" for a human face dataset) and are initialized as completely random embeddings. Importantly, our method induces only marginal additional parameter costs and requires no storage of user data for replay. We show that C-LoRA not only outperforms several baselines for our proposed setting of text-to-image continual customization, which we refer to as Continual Diffusion, but that we achieve a new state-of-the-art in the well-established rehearsal-free continual learning setting for image classification. The high achieving performance of C-LoRA in two separate domains positions it as a compelling solution for a wide range of applications, and we believe it has significant potential for practical impact",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Training recurrent neural networks typically relies on backpropagation through time (BPTT). BPTT depends on forward and backward passes to be completed, rendering the network locked to these computations before loss gradients are available. Recently, Jaderberg et al. proposed synthetic gradients to alleviate the need for full BPTT. In their implementation synthetic gradients are learned through a mixture of backpropagated gradients and bootstrapped synthetic gradients, analogous to the temporal difference (TD) algorithm in Reinforcement Learning (RL). However, as in TD learning, heavy use of bootstrapping can result in bias which leads to poor synthetic gradient estimates. Inspired by the accumulate $\\mathrm{TD}(\\lambda)$ in RL, we propose a fully online method for learning synthetic gradients which avoids the use of BPTT altogether: \\emph{accumulate} $BP(\\lambda)$. As in accumulate $\\mathrm{TD}(\\lambda)$, we show analytically that {accumulate~$\\mathrm{BP}(\\lambda)$} can control the level of bias by using a mixture of temporal difference errors and recursively defined eligibility traces. We next demonstrate empirically that our model outperforms the original implementation for learning synthetic gradients in a variety of tasks, and is particularly suited for capturing longer timescales. Finally, building on recent work we reflect on accumulate $\\mathrm{BP}(\\lambda)$ as a principle for learning in biological circuits. In summary, inspired by RL principles we introduce an algorithm capable of bias-free online learning via synthetic gradients",

To fill that gap, we introduce GUARD, a Generalized Unified SAfe Reinforcement Learning Development Benchmark. GUARD has several advantages compared to existing benchmarks. First, GUARD is a generalized benchmark with a wide variety of RL agents, tasks, and safety constraint specifications. Second, GUARD comprehensively covers state-of-the-art safe RL algorithms with self-contained implementations. Third, GUARD is highly customizable in tasks and algorithms.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Extractive opinion summarization involves automatically producing a summary of text about an entity (e.g., a product's reviews) by extracting representative sentences that capture prevalent opinions in the review set. Typically, in online marketplaces user reviews accrue over time, and opinion summaries must be updated periodically to provide customers with up-to-date information. In this work, we study the task of extractive opinion summarization in an incremental setting, where the underlying review set evolves over time. Many of the state-of-the-art extractive opinion summarization approaches are centrality-based, such as CentroidRank (Radev et al., 2004; Chowdhury et al., 2022). CentroidRank performs extractive summarization by selecting a subset of review sentences closest to the centroid in the representation space as the summary. However, these methods are not capable of operating efficiently in an incremental setting, where reviews arrive one at a time. In this paper, we present an efficient algorithm for accurately computing the CentroidRank summaries in an incremental setting. Our approach, CoverSumm, relies on indexing review representations in a cover tree and maintaining a reservoir of candidate summary review sentences. CoverSumm's efficacy is supported by a theoretical and empirical analysis of running time. Empirically, on a diverse collection of data (both real and synthetically created to illustrate scaling considerations), we demonstrate that CoverSumm is up to 25x faster than baseline methods, and capable of adapting to nuanced changes in data distribution. We also conduct human evaluations of the generated summaries and find that CoverSumm is capable of producing informative summaries consistent with the underlying review set",

Our method provides an efficient approach to embrace various computationally demanding robust learning objectives that have been proposed for ANNs.

We first explore the training dynamics of EMA, give guidelines for hyperparameter tuning, and highlight its good early performance, partly explaining its success as a teacher. We also observe that EMA requires less learning rate decay compared to SGD since averaging naturally reduces noise, introducing a form of implicit regularization. Through extensive experiments, we show that EMA solutions differ from last-iterate solutions. EMA models not only generalize better but also exhibit improved i) robustness to noisy labels, ii) prediction consistency, iii) calibration and iv) transfer learning. Therefore, we suggest that an EMA of weights is a simple yet effective plug-in to improve the performance of deep learning models",

    "abstract": "Self-attention models have made great strides toward accurately modeling a wide array of data modalities, including, more recently, graph-structured data. This paper demonstrates that adaptive hierarchical attention can go a long way toward successfully applying transformers to graphs. Our proposed model Sequoia provides a powerful inductive bias towards long-range interaction modeling, leading to better generalization. We propose an end-to-end mechanism for a data-dependent construction of a hierarchy which in turn guides the self-attention mechanism. Using adaptive hierarchy provides a natural pathway toward sparse attention by constraining node-to-node interactions with the immediate family of each node in the hierarchy (e.g., parent, children, and siblings). This in turn dramatically reduces the computational complexity of a self-attention layer from quadratic to log-linear in terms of the input size while maintaining or sometimes even surpassing the standard transformer's ability to model long-range dependencies across the entire input. Experimentally, we report state-of-the-art performance on long-range graph benchmarks while remaining computationally efficient. Moving beyond graphs, we also display competitive performance on long-range sequence modeling, point-clouds classification, and segmentation when using a fixed hierarchy.

Implementation challenges are resolved and experimental validation is presented, including a rigorous analysis of accuracy and a demonstration of using the presented result as the objective of a neural network.

Machine learning models with high parameter counts are optimised primarily with gradients, so if piecewise linear density representations are to be used then the presented analytic solution is essential. This paper contributes the necessary theory for the practical optimisation of information theoretic objectives when dealing with piecewise linear distributions directly. Removing this limitation expands the design space for future algorithms",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Structure-based drug design, a critical aspect of drug discovery, aims to identify high-affinity molecules for target protein pockets. Traditional virtual screening methods, which involve exhaustive searches within large molecular databases, are inefficient and limited in discovering novel molecules. The pocket-based 3D molecular generation model offers a promising alternative by directly generating molecules with 3D structures and binding positions in the pocket. In this paper, we present VD-Gen, a novel pocket-based 3D molecular generation pipeline. VD-Gen features a series of carefully designed stages to generate fine-grained 3D molecules with binding positions in the pocket cavity end-to-end. Rather than directly generating or sampling atoms with 3D positions in the pocket, VD-Gen randomly initializes multiple virtual particles within the pocket and learns to iteratively move them to approximate the distribution of molecular atoms in 3D space. After the iterative movement, a 3D molecule is extracted and further refined through additional iterative movement, yielding a high-quality 3D molecule with a confidence score. Comprehensive experimental results on pocket-based molecular generation demonstrate that VD-Gen can generate novel 3D molecules that fill the target pocket cavity with high binding affinities, significantly outperforming previous baselines",

    "title": "How good is Good-Turing for Markov samples?",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "The Good-Turing (GT) estimator for the missing mass (i.e., total probability of missing symbols) in $n$ samples is the number of symbols that appeared exactly once divided by $n$. For i.i.d. samples, the bias and squared-error risk of the GT estimator can be shown to fall as $1/n$ by bounding the expected error uniformly over all symbols. In this work, we study convergence of the GT estimator for missing stationary mass (i.e., total stationary probability of missing symbols) of Markov samples on an alphabet $\\mathcal{X}$ with stationary distribution $[\\pi_x:x\\in\\cX]$ and transition probability matrix (t.p.m.) $P$. This is an important and interesting problem because GT is widely used in applications with temporal dependencies such as language models assigning probabilities to word sequences, which are modelled as Markov. We show that convergence of GT depends on convergence of $(P^{\\sim x})^n$, where $P^{\\sim x}$ is $P$ with the $x$-th column zeroed out. This, in turn, depends on the Perron eigenvalue $\\lambda^{\\sim x}$ of $P^{\\sim x}$ and its relationship with $\\pi_x$ uniformly over $x$. For randomly generated t.p.ms and t.p.ms derived from New York Times and Charles Dickens corpora, we numerically exhibit such uniform-over-$x$ relationships between $\\lambda^{\\sim x}$ and $\\pi_x$. This supports the observed success of GT in language models and practical text data scenarios. For Markov chains with rank-2, diagonalizable t.p.ms having spectral gap $\\beta$, we show minimax rate upper and lower bounds of $1/(n\\beta^5)$ and $1/(n\\beta)$, respectively, for the estimation of stationary missing mass. This theoretical result extends the $1/n$ minimax rate for i.i.d. or rank-1 t.p.ms to rank-2 Markov, and is a first such minimax rate result for missing mass of Markov samples. We also show, through experiments, that the MSE of GT decays at a slower rate as the rank of the t.p.m increases",

    "abstract": "Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms have shown tremendous success in simulation environments, but their application to real-world problems faces significant challenges, with safety being a major concern. In particular, enforcing state-wise constraints is essential for many challenging tasks such as autonomous driving and robot manipulation. However, existing safe RL algorithms under the framework of Constrained Markov Decision Process (CMDP) do not consider state-wise constraints. To address this gap, we propose State-wise Constrained Policy Optimization (SCPO), the first general-purpose policy search algorithm for state-wise constrained reinforcement learning. SCPO provides guarantees for state-wise constraint satisfaction in expectation. In particular, we introduce the framework of Maximum Markov Decision Process, and prove that the worst-case safety violation is bounded under SCPO. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on training neural network policies for extensive robot locomotion tasks, where the agent must satisfy a variety of state-wise safety constraints. Our results show that SCPO significantly outperforms existing methods and can handle state-wise constraints in high-dimensional robotics tasks",

    "abstract": "In applications involving sensitive data, such as finance and healthcare, the necessity for preserving data privacy can be a significant barrier to machine learning model development. Differential privacy (DP) has emerged as one canonical standard for provable privacy. However, DP's strong theoretical guarantees often come at the cost of a large drop in its utility for machine learning; and DP guarantees themselves are difficult to interpret. In this work, we propose a novel privacy notion, membership inference privacy (MIP), as a step towards addressing these challenges. We give a precise characterization of the relationship between MIP and DP, and show that in some cases, MIP can be achieved using less amount of randomness compared to the amount required for guaranteeing DP, leading to smaller drop in utility. MIP guarantees are also easily interpretable in terms of the success rate of membership inference attacks in a simple random subsampling setting. As a proof of concept, we also provide a simple algorithm for guaranteeing MIP without needing to guarantee DP",

This dependence can be reduced by adapting the score function to the data distribution, thereby improving the conditional validity of conformal prediction sets. As an illustration, we construct a variant of the MADSplit conformal regression procedure where conditional mean estimates are computed in-distribution and show through empirical validation that our method is more robust to overfitting effects than the original method, while being more sample-efficient than modern ECDF-based methods",

Numerical examples show that these networks are FLOP-efficient for sufficiently oscillatory integrands with an average FLOP gain of $10^{3}$ FLOPs. The network calculates oscillatory integrals better than traditional quadrature methods under the same computational budget or number of floating point operations. We find that feed-forward networks of 5 hidden layers are satisfactory for a relative accuracy of $10^{-3}$. The computational burden of inference of the neural network is relatively small, even compared to inner-product pattern quadrature rules.

We explore CLIP along three dimensions: data, architecture, and training strategies. With regards to data, we demonstrate the significance of high-quality training data and show that a smaller dataset of high-quality data can outperform a larger dataset with lower quality. We also examine how model performance varies with different dataset sizes, suggesting that smaller ViT models are better suited for smaller datasets, while larger models perform better on larger datasets with fixed compute. Additionally, we provide guidance on when to choose a CNN-based architecture or a ViT-based architecture for CLIP training. We compare four CLIP training strategies - SLIP, FLIP, CLIP, and CLIP+Data Augmentation - and show that the choice of training strategy depends on the available compute resource. Our analysis reveals that CLIP+Data Augmentation can achieve comparable performance to CLIP using only half of the training data. This work provides practical insights into how to effectively train and deploy CLIP models, making them more accessible and affordable for practical use in various applications",

Our approach uses tensor networks instead of deep variational autoencoders for this purpose, and it yields significant speedups with no loss of accuracy. Empirical results on ATARI games demonstrate that our approach leads to a speedup in the time it takes to encode data and train a predictor using the encodings (between 2.6× to 9.6× compared to autoencoders or variational autoencoders). Furthermore, the tensor train encoding can be efficiently trained on CPU as well, which leads to comparable or better training times than the autoencoder and variational autoencoder trained on GPU (0.9× to 5.4× faster). These results suggest significant possibilities in mitigating the need for cost and time-intensive hardware for training deep-learning architectures for behavioral cloning",

Despite GAN-based methods attaining state-of-the-art performance in generating EHR data, these approaches are difficult to train and prone to mode collapse. Recently introduced in generative modeling, diffusion models have established cutting-edge performance in image generation, but their efficacy in EHR data synthesis remains largely unexplored.

    "title": "Understanding Fairness Surrogate Functions in Algorithmic Fairness",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "It has been observed that machine learning algorithms exhibit biased predictions against certain population groups. To mitigate such bias while achieving comparable accuracy, a promising approach is to introduce surrogate functions of the concerned fairness definition and solve a constrained optimization problem. However, it is intriguing in previous work that such fairness surrogate functions may yield unfair results and high instability. In this work, in order to deeply understand them, taking a widely used fairness definition—demographic parity as an example, we show that there is a surrogate-fairness gap between the fairness definition and the fairness surrogate function. Also, the theoretical analysis and experimental results about the \"gap\" motivate us that the fairness and stability will be affected by the points far from the decision boundary, which is the large margin points issue investigated in this paper. To address it, we propose the general sigmoid surrogate to simultaneously reduce both the surrogate-fairness gap and the variance, and offer a rigorous fairness and stability upper bound. Interestingly, the theory also provides insights into two important issues that deal with the large margin points as well as obtaining a more balanced dataset are beneficial to fairness and stability. Furthermore, we elaborate a novel and general algorithm called Balanced Surrogate, which iteratively reduces the \"gap\" to mitigate unfairness. Finally, we provide empirical evidence showing that our methods consistently improve fairness and stability while maintaining accuracy comparable to the baselines in three real-world datasets",

In particular, we prove that (i) entropy regularization and weight decay ensure stability by providing sufficient exploration to avoid near-deterministic and strictly suboptimal policies and (ii) regularization leads to sharp sample complexity and network width bounds in the regularized MDPs, yielding a favorable bias-variance tradeoff in policy optimization.

    "abstract": "Ensemble methods combine the predictions of multiple models to improve performance, but they require significantly higher computation costs at inference time. To avoid these costs, multiple neural networks can be combined into one by averaging their weights. However, this usually performs significantly worse than ensembling. Weight averaging is only beneficial when different enough to benefit from combining them, but similar enough to average well. Based on this idea, we propose PopulAtion Parameter Averaging (PAPA): a method that combines the generality of ensembling with the efficiency of weight averaging. PAPA leverages a population of diverse models (trained on different data orders, augmentations, and regularizations) while slowly pushing the weights of the networks toward the population average of the weights. We also propose PAPA variants (PAPA-all, and PAPA-2) that average weights rarely rather than continuously; all methods increase generalization, but PAPA tends to perform best. PAPA reduces the performance gap between averaging and ensembling, increasing the average accuracy of a population of models by up to 0.8% on CIFAR-10, 1.9% on CIFAR-100, and 1.6% on ImageNet when compared to training independent (non-averaged) models",

In this paper, we focus on the more challenging and realistic setting where group annotations are only available on a small validation set or are not available at all. We propose BAM, a novel two-stage training algorithm: in the first stage, the model is trained using a bias amplification scheme via introducing a learnable auxiliary variable for each training sample; in the second stage, we upweight the samples that the bias-amplified model misclassifies, and then continue training the same model on the reweighted dataset. Empirically, BAM achieves competitive performance compared with existing methods evaluated on spurious correlation benchmarks in computer vision and natural language processing. Moreover, we find a simple stopping criterion based on minimum class accuracy difference that can remove the need for group annotations, with little or no loss in worst-group accuracy.

New subjects only demonstrate the single component gestures and we seek to extrapolate from these to all possible single or combination gestures. We extrapolate to unseen combination gestures by combining the feature vectors of real single gestures to produce synthetic training data. This strategy allows us to provide a large and flexible gesture vocabulary, while not requiring new subjects to demonstrate combinatorially many example gestures. We pre-train an encoder and a combination operator using self-supervision, so that we can produce useful synthetic training data for unseen test subjects. To evaluate the proposed method, we collect a real-world EMG dataset, and measure the effect of augmented supervision against two baselines: a partially-supervised model trained with only single gesture data from the unseen subject, and a fully-supervised model trained with real single and real combination gesture data from the unseen subject. We find that the proposed method provides a dramatic improvement over the partially-supervised model, and achieves a useful classification accuracy that in some cases approaches the performance of the fully-supervised model",

We propose two generic new algorithms that apply in all these settings; we also prove that we can benefit from this framework under the Hessian similarity assumption between the target and side information.

    "abstract": "Enhancing the generalisation abilities of neural networks (NNs) through integrating noise such as MixUp or Dropout during training has emerged as a powerful and adaptable technique. Despite the proven efficacy of noise in NN training, there is no consensus regarding which noise sources, types and placements yield maximal benefits in generalisation and confidence calibration. This study thoroughly explores diverse noise modalities to evaluate their impacts on NN's generalisation and calibration under in-distribution or out-of-distribution settings, paired with experiments investigating the metric landscapes of the learnt representations, across a spectrum of NN architectures, tasks, and datasets. Our study shows that AugMix and weak augmentation exhibit cross-task effectiveness in computer vision, emphasising the need to tailor noise to specific domains. Our findings emphasise the efficacy of combining noises and successful hyperparameter transfer within a single domain but the difficulties in transferring the benefits to other domains. Furthermore, the study underscores the complexity of simultaneously optimising for both generalisation and calibration, emphasising the need for practitioners to carefully consider noise combinations and hyperparameter tuning for optimal performance in specific tasks and datasets",

    "abstract": "Neural Collapse refers to the curious phenomenon in the end of training of a neural network, where feature vectors and classification weights converge to a very simple geometrical arrangement (a simplex). While it has been observed empirically in various cases and has been theoretically motivated, its connection with crucial properties of neural networks, like their generalization and robustness, remains unclear. In this work, we study the stability properties of these simplices. We find that the simplex structure disappears under small adversarial attacks, and that perturbed examples \"leap\" between simplex vertices. We further analyze the geometry of networks that are optimized to be robust against adversarial perturbations of the input, and find that Neural Collapse is a pervasive phenomenon in these cases as well, with clean and perturbed representations forming aligned simplices, and giving rise to a robust simple nearest-neighbor classifier. By studying the propagation of the amount of collapse inside the network, we identify novel properties of both robust and non-robust machine learning models, and show that earlier, unlike later layers maintain reliable simplices on perturbed data",

    "abstract": "Despite advances in generative methods, accurately modeling the distribution of graphs remains a challenging task primarily because of the absence of predefined or inherent unique graph representation. Two main strategies have emerged to tackle this issue: 1) restricting the number of possible representations by sorting the nodes, or 2) using permutation-invariant/equivariant functions, specifically Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). In this paper, we introduce a new framework named Discrete Graph Auto-Encoder (DGAE), which leverages the strengths of both strategies and mitigate their respective limitations. In essence, we propose a strategy in 2 steps. We first use a permutation-equivariant auto-encoder to convert graphs into sets of discrete latent node representations, each node being represented by a sequence of quantized vectors. In the second step, we sort the sets of discrete latent representations and learn their distribution with a specifically designed auto-regressive model based on the Transformer architecture. Through multiple experimental evaluations, we demonstrate the competitive performances of our model in comparison to the existing state-of-the-art across various datasets.

    "abstract": "Despite the effectiveness of deep neural networks in numerous natural language processing applications, recent findings have exposed the vulnerability of these language models when minor perturbations are introduced. While appearing semantically indistinguishable to humans, these perturbations can significantly reduce the performance of well-trained language models, raising concerns about the reliability of deploying them in safe-critical situations. In this work, we construct a computationally efficient self-healing process to correct undesired model behavior during online inference when perturbations are applied to input data. This is formulated as a trajectory optimization problem in which the internal states of the neural network layers are automatically corrected using a PID (Proportional-Integral-Derivative) control mechanism. The P controller targets immediate state adjustments, while the I and D controllers consider past states and future dynamical trends, respectively. We leverage the geometrical properties of the training data to design effective linear PID controllers. This approach reduces the computational cost to that of using just the P controller, instead of the full PID control. Further, we introduce an analytical method for approximating the optimal control solutions, enhancing the real-time inference capabilities of this controlled system. Moreover, we conduct a theoretical error analysis of the analytic solution in a simplified setting. The proposed PID control-based self-healing is a low-cost framework that improves the robustness of pre-trained large language models, whether standard or robustly trained, against a wide range of perturbations",

In this paper, we establish a precise and quantifiable correspondence between data heterogeneity and parameters in the convergence rate when a fraction of data is shuffled across clients. We discuss that shuffling can, in some cases, quadratically reduce the gradient dissimilarity with respect to the shuffling percentage, accelerating convergence.

The best models for such data types in most standard supervised learning settings with IID (non-graph) data are not simple neural network layers and thus are not easily incorporated into a GNN. Here we propose a robust stacking framework that fuses graph-aware propagation with arbitrary models intended for IID data, which are ensembled and stacked in multiple layers. Our layer-wise framework leverages bagging and stacking strategies to enjoy strong generalization, in a manner which effectively mitigates label leakage and overfitting.

    "abstract": "In stochastic contextual bandits, an agent sequentially makes actions from a time-dependent action set based on past experience to minimize the cumulative regret. Like many other machine learning algorithms, the performance of bandits heavily depends on the values of hyperparameters, and theoretically derived parameter values may lead to unsatisfactory results in practice. Moreover, it is infeasible to use offline tuning methods like cross-validation to choose hyperparameters under the bandit environment, as the decisions should be made in real-time. To address this challenge, we propose the first online continuous hyperparameter tuning framework for contextual bandits to learn the optimal parameter configuration in practice within a search space on the fly. Specifically, we use a double-layer bandit framework named CDT (Continuous Dynamic Tuning) and formulate the hyperparameter optimization as a non-stationary continuum-armed bandit, where each arm represents a combination of hyperparameters, and the corresponding reward is the algorithmic result. For the top layer, we propose the Zooming TS algorithm that utilizes Thompson Sampling (TS) for exploration and a restart technique to get around the \\textit{switching} environment. The proposed CDT framework can be easily utilized to tune contextual bandit algorithms without any pre-specified candidate set for multiple hyperparameters. We further show that it could achieve a sublinear regret in theory and performs consistently better than all existing methods on both synthetic and real datasets",

We analyze the convergence of Local SGD (or FedAvg) for such over-parameterized models in the heterogeneous data setting and improve upon the existing literature by establishing the following convergence rates. For general convex loss functions, we establish an error bound of $\\mathcal {O}(1/T)$ under a mild data similarity assumption and an error bound of $\\mathcal {O}(K/T)$ otherwise, where $K$ is the number of local steps and $T$ is the total number of iterations. For non-convex loss functions we prove an error bound of $\\mathcal {O}(K/T)$. These bounds improve upon the best previous bound of $\\mathcal {O}(1/\\sqrt{nT})$ in both cases, where $n$ is the number of agents, when no assumption on the model being over-parameterized is made. We complete our results by providing problem instances in which our established convergence rates are tight to a constant factor with a reasonably small stepsize.

Theoretically, we present the convergence rate considering the effects of delay of the proposed algorithm with constant step size when the smooth objective functions are weakly strongly-convex, general convex, and nonconvex. One practical variant of PC-ASGD is also proposed by adopting a condition to help with the determination of the tradeoff parameter.

While past work has generally been limited to linear systems that have a closed-form solution, we consider using the conjugate gradient method to find a solution. We show that using the conjugate gradient method can outperform closed-form solutions, enables merging via linear systems that are otherwise intractable to solve, and flexibly allows choosing from a wide variety of initializations and estimates for the ''task parameter subspace''.

    "title": "INSPIRE: Incorporating Diverse Feature Preferences in Recourse",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Most recourse generation approaches optimize for indirect distance-based metrics like diversity, proximity, and sparsity, or a shared cost function across all users. A shared cost function in particular is an unrealistic assumption because users can have diverse feature preferences (FPs), i.e. the features they are willing to act upon to obtain recourse. In this work, we propose a novel method, INSPIRE to incorporate diverse feature preferences in both recourse generation and evaluation procedures by focusing on the cost incurred by a user when opting for a recourse. To achieve this, we first propose an objective function, Expected Minimum Cost (EMC) based on two key ideas: (1) the user should be comfortable adopting at least one solution when presented with multiple options, and (2) we can provide users with multiple options that cover a wide variety of FPs when the user's FPs are unknown. To optimize for EMC, we propose a novel discrete optimization algorithm, Cost-Optimized Local Search (COLS), that is guaranteed to improve the quality of the recourse set over iterations. Next, we propose a cost-based evaluation procedure that computes user satisfaction by simulating each user's cost function and then computing the incurred cost for the provided recourse set. Experiments on popular real-world datasets demonstrate that our method is more fair compared to baselines and satisfies up to 25.9% more users. We also show that our method is robust to misspecifications of the cost function distribution.

While a few recent methods can discover 3D objects from a single image, they remain struggling on scenes with diverse and complex object configurations as they discover objects mostly by appearance similarity which is insufficient for textured objects. In this work, we propose Movable Object Radiance Fields (MORF), aiming at scaling to complex scenes with diverse categories of objects. Inspired by cognitive science studies of object learning in babies, MORF learns 3D object representations via movable object inference. While obtaining 3D movable object signals requires multi-view videos of moving objects, we propose lifting a 2D movable object inference module that can be unsupervisedly pretrained on monocular videos. Thus, MORF requires only multi-view images of static training scenes. During testing, MORF can discover, reconstruct, and move unseen objects from novel categories, all from a single image of novel scenes. We propose a challenging simulated dataset with a diverse set of textured objects for training and testing.

However, existing diffusion-based video editing approaches lack the ability to offer precise control over generated content that maintains temporal consistency in long-term videos. On the other hand, atlas-based methods provide strong temporal consistency but are costly to edit a video and lack spatial control. In this work, we introduce VidEdit, a novel method for zero-shot text-based video editing that guarantees robust temporal and spatial consistency. In particular, we combine an atlas-based video representation with a pre-trained text-to-image diffusion model to provide a training-free and efficient video editing method, which by design fulfills temporal smoothness. To grant precise user control over generated content, we utilize conditional information extracted from off-the-shelf panoptic segmenters and edge detectors which guides the diffusion sampling process. This method ensures a fine spatial control on targeted regions while strictly preserving the structure of the original video. Our quantitative and qualitative experiments show that VidEdit outperforms state-of-the-art methods on DAVIS dataset, regarding semantic faithfulness, image preservation, and temporal consistency metrics. With this framework, processing a single video only takes approximately one minute, and it can generate multiple compatible edits based on a unique text prompt",

    "title": "HQ-VAE: Hierarchical Discrete Representation Learning with Variational Bayes",

    "abstract": "Vector quantization (VQ) is a technique to deterministically learn features with discrete codebook representations. It is commonly performed with a variational autoencoding model, VQ-VAE, which can be further extended to hierarchical structures for making high-fidelity reconstructions. However, such hierarchical extensions of VQ-VAE often suffer from the codebook/layer collapse issue, where the codebook is not efficiently used to express the data, and hence degrades reconstruction accuracy. To mitigate this problem, we propose a novel unified framework to stochastically learn hierarchical discrete representation on the basis of the variational Bayes framework, called hierarchically quantized variational autoencoder (HQ-VAE).

    "abstract": "Here, we develop a new class of Bayesian latent variable model, the recognition parameterised model (RPM). RPMs have an implicit likelihood, which is defined in terms of the recognition model. Therefore, it is not possible to do traditional \"generation\" with RPMs. Instead, RPMs are designed to learn good latent representations of data (in modern parlance, they solve a self-supervised learning task). Indeed, the RPM implicit likelihood is specifically designed so that it drops out of the VI objective, the ELBO. That allows us to learn an RPM without a \"reconstruction\" step, which is believed to be at the root of poor latent representations learned by VAEs. Indeed, in a very specific setting where we learn the optimal prior, the RPM ELBO becomes equal to the mutual information (MI; up to a constant), establishing a connection to pre-existing self-supervised learning methods such as InfoNCE",

Real-world decision making applications require algorithms that can guarantee robust performance and safety in the presence of general environment disturbances, while making limited assumptions on the data collection process during training. In order to accomplish this goal, we introduce a safe reinforcement learning framework that incorporates robustness through the use of an optimal transport cost uncertainty set. We provide an efficient implementation based on applying Optimal Transport Perturbations to construct worst-case virtual state transitions, which does not impact data collection during training and does not require detailed simulator access.

    "title": "New Guarantees for Learning Revenue Maximizing Menus of Lotteries and Two-Part Tariffs",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "We advance a recently flourishing line of work at the intersection of learning theory and computational economics by studying the learnability of two classes of mechanisms prominent in economics, namely menus of lotteries and two-part tariffs. The former is a family of randomized mechanisms designed for selling multiple items, known to achieve revenue beyond deterministic mechanisms, while the latter is designed for selling multiple units (copies) of a single item with applications in real-world scenarios such as car or bike-sharing services. We focus on learning high-revenue mechanisms of this form from buyer valuation data in both distributional settings, where we have access to buyers' valuation samples up-front, and the more challenging and less-studied online settings, where buyers arrive one-at-a-time and no distributional assumption is made about their values. We provide a suite of results with regard to these two families of mechanisms. We provide the first online learning algorithms for menus of lotteries and two-part tariffs with strong regret-bound guarantees. Since the space of parameters is infinite and the revenue functions have discontinuities, the known techniques do not readily apply. However, we are able to provide a reduction to online learning over a finite number of experts, in our case, a finite number of parameters. Furthermore, in the limited buyers type case, we show a reduction to online linear optimization, which allows us to obtain no-regret guarantees by presenting buyers with menus that correspond to a barycentric spanner. In addition, we provide algorithms with improved running times over prior work for the distributional settings. Finally, we demonstrate how techniques from the recent literature in data-driven algorithm design are insufficient for our studied problems",

    "abstract": "The rapidly increasing size of deep-learning models has renewed interest in alternatives to digital-electronic computers as a means to dramatically reduce the energy cost of running state-of-the-art neural networks. Optical matrix-vector multipliers are best suited to performing computations with very large operands, which suggests that large Transformer models could be a good target for them. In this paper, we investigate---through a combination of simulations and experiments on prototype optical hardware---the feasibility and potential energy benefits of running Transformer models on future optical accelerators that perform matrix-vector multiplication. We use simulations, with noise models validated by small-scale optical experiments, to show that optical accelerators for matrix-vector multiplication should be able to accurately run a typical Transformer architecture model for language processing. We demonstrate that optical accelerators can achieve the same (or better) perplexity as digital-electronic processors at 8-bit precision, provided that the optical hardware uses sufficiently many photons per inference, which translates directly to a requirement on optical energy per inference. We studied numerically how the requirement on optical energy per inference changes as a function of the Transformer width $d$ and found that the optical energy per multiply--accumulate (MAC) scales approximately as $\\frac{1}{d}$, giving an asymptotic advantage over digital systems. We also analyze the total system energy costs for optical accelerators running Transformers, including both optical and electronic costs, as a function of model size. We predict that well-engineered, large-scale optical hardware should be able to achieve a $100 \\times$ energy-efficiency advantage over current digital-electronic processors in running some of the largest current Transformer models, and if both the models and the optical hardware are scaled to the quadrillion-parameter regime, optical accelerators could have a $>8,000\\times$ energy-efficiency advantage. Under plausible assumptions about future improvements to electronics and Transformer quantization techniques (5× cheaper memory access, double the digital--analog conversion efficiency, and 4-bit precision), we estimate that the energy advantage for optical processors versus electronic processors operating at 300~fJ/MAC could grow to $>100,000\\times$",

    "title": "Embracing Unknown Step by Step: Towards Reliable Sparse Training in Real World",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Sparse training has emerged as a promising method for resource-efficient deep neural networks (DNNs) in real-world applications. However, the reliability of sparse models remains a crucial concern, particularly in detecting unknown out-of-distribution (OOD) data. This study addresses the knowledge gap by investigating the reliability of sparse training from an OOD perspective and reveals that sparse training exacerbates OOD unreliability. The lack of unknown information and the sparse constraints hinder the effective exploration of weight space and accurate differentiation between known and unknown knowledge. To tackle these challenges, we propose a new unknown-aware sparse training method, which incorporates a loss modification, auto-tuning strategy, and a voting scheme to guide weight space exploration and mitigate confusion between known and unknown information without incurring significant additional costs or requiring access to additional OOD data. Theoretical insights demonstrate how our method reduces model confidence when faced with OOD samples. Empirical experiments across multiple datasets, model architectures, and sparsity levels validate the effectiveness of our method, with improvements of up to \\textbf{8.4\\%} in AUROC while maintaining comparable or higher accuracy and calibration. This research enhances the understanding and readiness of sparse DNNs for deployment in resource-limited applications. Our code is available on: \\url{https://github.com/StevenBoys/MOON}",

    "title": "Revisiting Random Weight Perturbation for Efficiently Improving Generalization",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Improving the generalization ability of modern deep neural networks (DNNs) is a fundamental challenge in machine learning. Two branches of methods have been proposed to seek flat minima and improve generalization: one led by sharpness-aware minimization (SAM) minimizes the worst-case neighborhood loss through adversarial weight perturbation (AWP), and the other minimizes the expected Bayes objective with random weight perturbation (RWP). While RWP offers advantages in computation and is closely linked to AWP on a mathematical basis, its empirical performance has consistently lagged behind that of AWP. In this paper, we revisit the use of RWP for improving generalization and propose improvements from two perspectives: i) the trade-off between generalization and convergence and ii) the random perturbation generation. Through extensive experimental evaluations, we demonstrate that our enhanced RWP methods achieve greater efficiency in enhancing generalization, particularly in large-scale problems, while also offering comparable or even superior performance to SAM.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Despite the importance of denoising in modern machine learning and ample empirical work on supervised denoising, its theoretical understanding is still relatively scarce. One concern about studying supervised denoising is that one might not always have noiseless training data from the test distribution. It is more reasonable to have access to noiseless training data from a different dataset than the test dataset. Motivated by this, we study supervised denoising and noisy-input regression under distribution shift. We add three considerations to increase the applicability of our theoretical insights to real-life data and modern machine learning. First, while most past theoretical work assumes that the data covariance matrix is full-rank and well-conditioned, empirical studies have shown that real-life data is approximately low-rank. Thus, we assume that our data matrices are low-rank. Second, we drop independence assumptions on our data. Third, the rise in computational power and dimensionality of data have made it important to study non-classical regimes of learning. Thus, we work in the non-classical proportional regime, where data dimension $d$ and number of samples $N$ grow as $d/N = c + o(1)$. For this setting, we derive \\rishi{data-dependent, instance specific} expressions for the test error for both denoising and noisy-input regression, and study when overfitting the noise is benign, tempered or catastrophic. We show that the test error exhibits double descent under general distribution shift, providing insights for data augmentation and the role of noise as an implicit regularizer. We also perform experiments using real-life data, where we match the theoretical predictions with under 1\\% MSE error for low-rank data",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Differential Privacy (DP) is the de facto standard for reasoning about the privacy of a training algorithm. Yet, learning with DP often yields poor performance unless one trains on a large dataset. In this paper, we instead outline how training on less data can be beneficial when we are only interested in defending against specific attacks; we take the canonical example of defending against membership inference. To arrive at this result, we first derive (tight) bounds on the success of all membership inference attacks. These bounds do not replace DP, rather they introduce a complementary interpretation of a DP algorithm's ability to defend against membership inference specifically. Because our bound more tightly captures the effect of how training data was selected, we can show that decreasing the sampling rate when constructing the training dataset has a disparate effect on the bound when compared to strengthening the DP guarantee. Thus, when the privacy protection we care about is defending against membership inference, training on less data can yield more advantageous trade-offs between preventing membership inference and utility than strengthening the DP guarantee. We empirically illustrate this on MNIST, CIFAR10 and SVHN-extended",

GCD considers the open-world problem of automatically clustering a partially labelled dataset, in which the unlabelled data may contain instances from both novel categories and labelled classes. In this paper, we address the GCD problem with an unknown category number for the unlabelled data. We propose a framework, named CiPR, to bootstrap the representation by exploiting cross-instance positive relations in the partially labelled data for contrastive learning, which have been neglected in existing methods. To obtain reliable cross-instance relations to facilitate representation learning, we introduce a semi-supervised hierarchical clustering algorithm, named selective neighbor clustering (SNC), which can produce a clustering hierarchy directly from the connected components of a graph constructed from selective neighbors. We further present a method to estimate the unknown class number using SNC with a joint reference score that considers clustering indexes of both labelled and unlabelled data, and extend SNC to allow label assignment for the unlabelled instances with a given class number. We thoroughly evaluate our framework on public generic image recognition datasets and challenging fine-grained datasets, and establish a new state-of-the-art. Code: https://github.com/haoosz/CiPR",

In this paper, we take a pioneering step towards this ambitious goal by introducing a new concept called Forecast Utterance and then focus on the automatic and accurate interpretation of users' prediction goals from these utterances. Specifically, we frame the task as a slot-filling problem, where each slot corresponds to a specific aspect of the goal prediction task. We then employ two zero-shot methods for solving the slot-filling task, namely: 1) Entity Extraction (EE), and 2) Question-Answering (QA) techniques. Our experiments, evaluated with three meticulously crafted data sets, validate the viability of our ambitious goal and demonstrate the effectiveness of both EE and QA techniques in interpreting Forecast Utterances",

The proposed method can be used to compress the feature maps of a single layer, multiple layers, or the entire network according to specific needs. To this end, we also evaluated three different methods to compress the activation maps: Wavelet Transform, Discrete Cosine Transform, and Simple Thresholding. We performed experiments in two classification tasks for natural images and two semantic segmentation tasks for medical images. Using the proposed method, we could reduce the memory usage for activation maps by up to 95%.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "There is a growing concern about applying batch normalization (BN) in adversarial training (AT), especially when the model is trained on both adversarial samples and clean samples (termed Hybrid-AT). With the assumption that adversarial and clean samples are from two different domains, a common practice in prior works is to adopt Dual BN, where BN$_{adv}$ and BN$_{clean}$ are used for adversarial and clean branches, respectively. A popular belief for motivating Dual BN is that estimating normalization statistics of this mixture distribution is challenging and thus disentangling it for normalization achieves stronger robustness. In contrast to this belief, we reveal that disentangling statistics plays a less role than disentangling affine parameters in model training. This finding aligns with prior work (Rebuffi et al., 2023), and we build upon their research for further investigations. We demonstrate that the domain gap between adversarial and clean samples is not very large, which is counter-intuitive considering the significant influence of adversarial perturbation on the model accuracy. We further propose a two-task hypothesis which serves as the empirical foundation and a unified framework for Hybrid-AT improvement. We also investigate Dual BN in test-time and reveal that affine parameters characterize the robustness during inference. Overall, our work sheds new light on understanding the mechanism of Dual BN in Hybrid-AT and its underlying justification",

We conduct a convergence analysis on pL-UFG, addressing the gap in the understanding of its asymptotic behaviors. Further by investigating the generalized Dirichlet energy of pL-UFG, we demonstrate that the Dirichlet energy remains non-zero throughout convergence, ensuring the avoidance of over-smoothing issues. Additionally, we elucidate the energy dynamic perspective, highlighting the synergistic relationship between the implicit layer in pL-UFG and graph framelets. This synergy enhances the model's adaptability to both homophilic and heterophilic data. Notably, we reveal that pL-UFG can be interpreted as a generalized non-linear diffusion process, thereby bridging the gap between pL-UFG and differential equations on the graph. Importantly, these multifaceted analyses lead to unified conclusions that offer novel insights for understanding and implementing pL-UFG, as well as other graph neural network (GNN) models. Finally, based on our dynamic analysis, we propose two novel pL-UFG models with manually controlled energy dynamics. We demonstrate empirically and theoretically that our proposed models not only inherit the advantages of pL-UFG but also significantly reduce computational costs for training on large-scale graph datasets",

    "abstract": "The state-of-the-art dimensionality reduction approaches largely rely on complicated optimization procedures. On the other hand, closed-form approaches requiring merely eigen-decomposition do not have enough sophistication and nonlinearity. In this paper, we propose a novel nonlinear dimensionality reduction method---Inverse Kernel Decomposition (IKD)---based on an eigen-decomposition of the sample covariance matrix of data. The method is inspired by Gaussian process latent variable models (GPLVMs) and has comparable performance with GPLVMs. To deal with very noisy data with weak correlations, we propose two solutions---blockwise and geodesic---to make use of locally correlated data points and provide better and numerically more stable latent estimations. We use synthetic datasets and four real-world datasets to show that IKD is a better dimensionality reduction method than other eigen-decomposition-based methods, and achieves comparable performance against optimization-based methods with faster running speeds.

Unlike conventional strategies, PPD employs additional compute resources to parallelize the initiation of subsequent token decoding during the current token decoding. This method reduces decoding latency and reshapes the understanding of trade-offs in LLM decoding strategies. We have developed a theoretical framework that allows us to analyze the trade-off between computation and latency. Using this framework, we can analytically estimate the potential reduction in latency associated with our proposed method, achieved through the assessment of the match rate, represented as $p_\\text{correct}$. The results demonstrate that the use of extra computational resources has the potential to accelerate LLM decoding. Additionally, we implement PPD and conduct preliminary experiments to empirically validate its efficacy, addressing potential practical overheads not covered by theoretical analysis",

    "abstract": "Federated learning (FL) aims to collaboratively train a global model using local data from a network of clients. To warrant collaborative training, each federated client may expect the resulting global model to satisfy some individual requirement, such as achieving a certain loss threshold on their local data. However, in real FL scenarios, the global model may not satisfy the requirements of all clients in the network due to the data heterogeneity across clients. In this work, we explore the problem of global model appeal in FL, which we define as the total number of clients that find that the global model satisfies their individual requirements. We discover that global models trained using traditional FL approaches can result in a significant number of clients unsatisfied with the model based on their local requirements. As a consequence, we show that global model appeal can directly impact how clients participate in training and how the model performs on new clients at inference time. Our work proposes MaxFL, which maximizes the number of clients that find the global model appealing. MaxFL achieves a $22$-$40\\%$ and $18$-$50\\%$ improvement in the test accuracy of training clients and (unseen) test clients respectively, compared to a wide range of FL approaches that tackle data heterogeneity, aim to incentivize clients, and learn personalized/fair models",

    "abstract": "A functional regression problem aims to learn a map $\\mathfrak{F}:\\mathcal{Z}\\mapsto\\mathcal{Y}$, where $\\mathcal{Z}$ is an appropriate input space and $\\mathcal{Y}$ is a space of output functions. When $\\mathcal{Z}$ is also a space of functions, the learning problem is known as function-to-function regression. In this work, we consider the problem of learning a map of the form ${F}:{\\mathcal{Z}}^p\\mapsto\\mathcal{Y}$, a many-to-one function-to-function regression problem, where the aim is to learn a suitable $F$ which maps $p$ input functions to an output function. In order to solve this regression problem with $p$ input functions and a corresponding output function, we propose a graph-induced operator-valued kernel (OVK) obtained by imposing a graphical structure describing the inter-relationships among the $p$ input functions. When the underlying graphical structure is unknown, we propose to learn an appropriate Laplacian matrix characterizing the graphical structure, which would also aid in learning the map $F$. We formulate a learning problem using the proposed graph-induced OVK, and devise an alternating minimization framework to solve the learning problem. To learn $F$ along with meaningful and important interactions in the graphical structure, a minimax concave penalty (MCP) is used as a sparsity-inducing regularization on the Laplacian matrix. We further extend the alternating minimization framework to learn $F$, where each of the $p$ constituent input functions as well as the output function are multi-dimensional. To scale the proposed algorithm to large datasets, we design an efficient sample-based approximation algorithm. Further, we provide bounds on generalization error for the map obtained by solving the proposed learning problem. An extensive empirical evaluation on both synthetic and real data demonstrates the utility of the proposed learning framework. Our experiments show that simultaneous learning of $F$ along with sparse graphical structure helps in discovering significant relationships among the input functions, and motivates interpretability of such relationships driving the regression problem",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "When trained on diverse labelled data, machine learning models have proven themselves to be a powerful tool in all facets of society. However, due to budget limitations, deliberate or non-deliberate censorship, and other problems during data collection, certain groups may be under-represented in the labelled training set. We investigate a scenario in which the absence of certain data is linked to the second level of a two-level hierarchy in the data. Inspired by the idea of protected attributes from algorithmic fairness, we consider generalised secondary \"attributes\" which subdivide the classes into smaller partitions. We refer to the partitions defined by the combination of an attribute and a class label, or leaf nodes in aforementioned hierarchy, as groups. To characterise the problem, we introduce the concept of classes with incomplete attribute support. The representational bias in the training set can give rise to spurious correlations between the classes and the attributes which cause standard classification models to generalise poorly to unseen groups. To overcome this bias, we make use of an additional, diverse but unlabelled dataset, called the deployment set, to learn a representation that is invariant to the attributes. This is done by adversarially matching the support of the training and deployment sets in representation space using a set discriminator operating on sets, or bags, of samples. In order to learn the desired invariance, it is paramount that the bags are balanced by class; this is easily achieved for the training set, but requires using semi-supervised clustering for the deployment set. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on several datasets and realisations of the problem",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Fair machine learning methods seek to train models that balance model performance across demographic subgroups defined over sensitive attributes like race and gender. Although sensitive attributes are typically assumed to be known during training, they may not be available in practice due to privacy and other logistical concerns. Recent work has sough to train fair models without sensitive attributes on training data. However, these methods need extensive hyper-parameter tuning to achieve good results, and hence assume that sensitive attributes are known on validation data. However, this assumption too might not be practical. Here, we propose Antigone, a framework to train fair classifiers without access to sensitive attributes on either training or validation data. Instead, we generate pseudo sensitive attributes on the validation data by training a ERM model and using the classifier's incorrectly (correctly) classified examples as proxies for disadvantaged (advantaged) groups. Since fairness metrics like demographic parity, equal opportunity and subgroup accuracy can be estimated to within a proportionality constant even with noisy sensitive attribute information, we show theoretically and empirically that these proxy labels can be used to maximize fairness under average accuracy constraints. Key to our results is a principled approach to select the hyper-parameters of the ERM model in a completely unsupervised fashion (meaning without access to ground truth sensitive attributes) that minimizes the gap between fairness estimated using noisy versus ground-truth sensitive labels. We demonstrate that Antigone outperforms existing methods on CelebA, Waterbirds, and UCI datasets",

    "abstract": "Cellular automata (CAs) are notable computational models exhibiting rich dynamics emerging from the local interaction of cells arranged in a regular lattice. Graph CAs (GCAs) generalise standard CAs by allowing for arbitrary graphs rather than regular lattices, similar to how Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) generalise Convolutional NNs. Recently, Graph Neural CAs (GNCAs) have been proposed as models built on top of standard GNNs that can be trained to approximate the transition rule of any arbitrary GCA. We note that existing GNCAs can violate the locality principle of CAs by leveraging global information and, furthermore, are anisotropic in the sense that their transition rules are not equivariant to isometries of the nodes' spatial locations. However, it is desirable for instances related by such transformations to be treated identically by the model. By replacing standard graph convolutions with E(n)-equivariant ones, we avoid anisotropy by design and propose a class of isotropic automata that we call E(n)-GNCAs. These models are lightweight, but can nevertheless handle large graphs, capture complex dynamics and exhibit emergent self-organising behaviours. We showcase the broad and successful applicability of E(n)-GNCAs on three different tasks: (i) isotropic pattern formation, (ii) graph auto-encoding, and (iii) simulation of E(n)-equivariant dynamical systems",

However, traditional GNNs, relying on message-passing mechanisms that gather information exclusively from first-order neighbours (known as positive samples), can lead to issues such as over-smoothing and over-squashing. To mitigate these issues, we propose a layer-diverse negative sampling method for message-passing propagation. This method employs a sampling matrix within a determinantal point process, which transforms the candidate set into a space and selectively samples from this space to generate negative samples. To further enhance the diversity of the negative samples during each forward pass, we develop a space-squeezing method to achieve layer-wise diversity in multi-layer GNNs. Experiments on various real-world graph datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in improving the diversity of negative samples and overall learning performance. Moreover, adding negative samples dynamically changes the graph's topology, thus with the strong potential to improve the expressiveness of GNNs and reduce the risk of over-squashing",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "One of the common approaches for personalizing federated learning is fine-tuning the global model for each local client. While this addresses some issues of statistical heterogeneity, we find that such personalization methods are vulnerable to spurious features at local agents, leading to reduced generalization performance. This work considers a setup where spurious features correlate with the label in each client's training environment, and the mixture of multiple training environments (i.e., the global environment) diminishes the spurious correlations. In other words, while the global federated learning model trained over the global environment suffers less from spurious features, the local fine-tuning step may lead to personalized models vulnerable to spurious correlations. In light of this practical and pressing challenge, we propose a novel strategy to mitigate the effect of spurious features during personalization by maintaining the adversarial transferability between the global and personalized models. Empirical results on object and action recognition tasks show that our proposed approach bounds personalized models from further exploiting spurious features while preserving the benefit of enhanced accuracy from fine-tuning",

Focusing on continuous probability distributions in the Euclidean space $\\mathbb{R}^d$, we introduce a novel pseudo-metric between probability distributions by leveraging the extension of univariate quantiles to multivariate spaces. Data depth is a nonparametric statistical tool that measures the centrality of any element $x\\in\\mathbb{R}^d$ with respect to (w.r.t.) a probability distribution or a dataset. It is a natural median-oriented extension of the cumulative distribution function (cdf) to the multivariate case. Thus, its upper-level sets---the depth-trimmed regions---give rise to a definition of multivariate quantiles. The new pseudo-metric relies on the average of the Hausdorff distance between the depth-based quantile regions for each distribution. Its good behavior regarding major transformation groups, as well as its ability to factor out translations, are depicted. Robustness, an appealing feature of this pseudo-metric, is studied through the finite sample breakdown point.

    "abstract": "World models are a powerful tool for developing intelligent agents. By predicting the outcome of a sequence of actions, world models enable policies to be optimised via on-policy reinforcement learning (RL) using synthetic data, i.e. in \"in imagination\". Existing world models are autoregressive in that they interleave predicting the next state with sampling the next action from the policy. Prediction error inevitably compounds as the trajectory length grows. In this work, we propose a novel world modelling approach that is not autoregressive and generates entire on-policy trajectories in a single pass through a diffusion model. Our approach, Policy-Guided Trajectory Diffusion (PolyGRAD), leverages a denoising model in addition to the gradient of the action distribution of the policy to diffuse a trajectory of initially random states and actions into an on-policy synthetic trajectory. We analyse the connections between PolyGRAD, score-based generative models, and classifier-guided diffusion models. Our results demonstrate that PolyGRAD outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in terms of trajectory prediction error for short trajectories, with the exception of autoregressive diffusion. For short trajectories, PolyGRAD obtains similar errors to autoregressive diffusion, but with lower computational requirements. For long trajectories, PolyGRAD obtains comparable performance to baselines. Our experiments demonstrate that PolyGRAD enables performant policies to be trained via on-policy RL in imagination for MuJoCo continuous control domains. Thus, PolyGRAD introduces a new paradigm for accurate on-policy world modelling without autoregressive sampling",

The most popular class of GNNs operate by exchanging information between adjacent nodes, and are known as Message Passing Neural Networks (MPNNs). While understanding the expressive power of MPNNs is a key question, existing results typically consider settings with uninformative node features. In this paper, we provide a rigorous analysis to determine which function classes of node features can be learned by an MPNN of a given capacity. We do so by measuring the level of *pairwise interactions* between nodes that MPNNs allow for. This measure provides a novel quantitative characterization of the so-called over-squashing effect, which is observed to occur when a large volume of messages is aggregated into fixed-size vectors. Using our measure, we prove that, to guarantee sufficient communication between pairs of nodes, the capacity of the MPNN must be large enough, depending on properties of the input graph structure, such as commute times. For many relevant scenarios, our analysis results in impossibility statements in practice, showing that *over-squashing hinders the expressive power of MPNNs*. Our theory also holds for geometric graphs and hence extends to equivariant MPNNs on point clouds. We validate our analysis through extensive controlled experiments and ablation studies",

Inconsistent AI models are considered brittle and untrustworthy by human users and are more challenging to incorporate into larger systems that take dependencies on their outputs. Measuring consistency between very heterogeneous tasks that might include outputs in different modalities is challenging since it is difficult to determine if the predictions are consistent with one another. As a solution, we introduce a benchmark dataset, CocoCON, where we create contrast sets by modifying test instances for multiple tasks in small but semantically meaningful ways to change the gold label and outline metrics for measuring if a model is consistent by ranking the original and perturbed instances across tasks. We find that state-of-the-art vision-language models suffer from a surprisingly high degree of inconsistent behavior across tasks, especially for more heterogeneous tasks. To alleviate this issue, we propose a rank correlation-based auxiliary training objective, computed over large automatically created cross-task contrast sets, that improves the multi-task consistency of large unified models while retaining their original accuracy on downstream tasks",

We leverage the duality between wide neural networks and Neural Tangent Kernels and propose a preconditioned gradient descent method, which alters the trajectory of GD. As a result, this allows for a polynomial and, in some cases, exponential training speedup without changing the final solution. Our method is both computationally efficient and simple to implement",

So far, they have shown promising empirical results, e.g., on molecular prediction datasets, often attributed to their ability to circumvent graph neural networks' shortcomings, such as over-smoothing and over-squashing. Here, we derive a taxonomy of graph transformer architectures, bringing some order to this emerging field. We overview their theoretical properties, survey structural and positional encodings, and discuss extensions for important graph classes, e.g., 3D molecular graphs. Empirically, we probe how well graph transformers can recover various graph properties, how well they can deal with heterophilic graphs, and to what extent they prevent over-squashing.

In this paper we consider the problem of building a data-based model for dynamical systems from a library of discrete components. In addition to optimizing performance, we consider crash and inequality constraints that arise from additional requirements, such as real-time capability and model complexity. We address this task of model structure selection with a focus on dynamical systems and propose to search over potential model structures efficiently using a constrained combinatorial Bayesian Optimization (BO) algorithm. We propose expressive surrogate models suited for combinatorial domains and an acquisition function that can handle inequality and crash constraints. We provide simulated benchmark problems within the domain of equation discovery of nonlinear dynamical systems. Our method outperforms the state-of-the-art in constrained combinatorial optimization of black-box functions and has a favorable computational overhead compared to other BO methods.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Federated learning (FL) is a distributed learning paradigm that allows multiple clients to collaboratively train a shared model via communications to a central server. However, optimal models of different clients often differ due to heterogeneity of data across clients. In this paper, we address the dichotomy between heterogeneous models and simultaneous training in FL via a clustering structure among the clients. The clustering framework is one way to allow for high heterogeneity level between clients, while clients with similar data can still train a shared model. We define a new clustering framework for FL based on the (optimal) local models of the clients: two clients belong to the same cluster if their local models are close. We propose an algorithm, \\emph{Successive Refine Federated Clustering Algorithm} (\\texttt{SR-FCA}), that treats each client as a singleton cluster as an initialization, and then successively refine the cluster estimation via exploiting similarity with other clients. In any intermediate step, \\texttt{SR-FCA} uses an {\\em error-tolerant} federated learning algorithm within each cluster to exploit simultaneous training and to correct clustering errors. Unlike some prominent prior works \\texttt{SR-FCA} does not require any \\emph{good} initialization (or warm start), both in theory and practice. We show that with proper choice of learning rate, \\texttt{SR-FCA} incurs arbitrarily small clustering error. Additionally, \\texttt{SR-FCA} does not require the knowledge of the number of clusters apriori like some prior works. We validate the performance of \\texttt{SR-FCA} on real-world FL datasets including FEMNIST and Shakespeare in non-convex problems and show the benefits of \\texttt{SR-FCA} over several baselines",

We propose an optimisation algorithm which addresses both of these concerns – to our knowledge, the first efficiently-scalable optimisation algorithm to asymptotically use the exact inverse Hessian with absolute-value eigenvalues. Our method frames the problem as a series which principally square-roots and inverts the squared Hessian, then uses it to precondition a gradient vector, all without explicitly computing or eigendecomposing the Hessian. A truncation of this infinite series provides a new optimisation algorithm which is scalable and comparable to other first- and second-order optimisation methods in both runtime and optimisation performance.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "An ever-growing body of work has shown that machine learning systems can be systematically biased against certain sub-populations defined by attributes like race or gender. Data imbalance and under-representation of certain populations in the training datasets have been identified as potential causes behind this phenomenon. However, understanding whether data imbalance with respect to a specific demographic group may result in biases for a given task and model class is not simple. An approach to answering this question is to perform controlled experiments, where several models are trained with different imbalance ratios and then their performance is evaluated on the target population. However, in the absence of ground-truth annotations at deployment for an unseen population, most fairness metrics cannot be computed. In this work, we explore an alternative method to study potential bias issues based on the output discrepancy of pools of models trained on different demographic groups. Models within a pool are otherwise identical in terms of architecture, hyper-parameters, and training scheme. Our hypothesis is that the output consistency between models may serve as a proxy to anticipate biases concerning demographic groups. In other words, if models tailored to different demographic groups produce inconsistent predictions, then biases are more prone to appear in the task under analysis. We formulate the Demographically-Informed Prediction Discrepancy Index (DIPDI) and validate our hypothesis in numerical experiments using both synthetic and real-world datasets. Our work sheds light on the relationship between model output discrepancy and demographic biases and provides a means to anticipate potential bias issues in the absence of ground-truth annotations. Indeed, we show how DIPDI could provide early warnings about potential demographic biases when deploying machine learning models on new and unlabeled populations that exhibit demographic shifts",

    "abstract": "We propose an efficient approach to train large diffusion models with masked transformers. While masked transformers have been extensively explored for representation learning, their application to generative learning is less explored in the vision domain. Our work is the first to exploit masked training to reduce the training cost of diffusion models significantly. Specifically, we randomly mask out a high proportion (e.g., 50\\%) of patches in diffused input images during training. For masked training, we introduce an asymmetric encoder-decoder architecture consisting of a transformer encoder that operates only on unmasked patches and a lightweight transformer decoder on full patches. To promote a long-range understanding of full patches, we add an auxiliary task of reconstructing masked patches to the denoising score matching objective that learns the score of unmasked patches. Experiments on ImageNet-256x256 and ImageNet-512x512 show that our approach achieves competitive and even better generative performance than the state-of-the-art Diffusion Transformer (DiT) model, using only around 30\\% of its original training time. Thus, our method shows a promising way of efficiently training large transformer-based diffusion models without sacrificing the generative performance.

In this paper, we study functional regression of contextual CDF{}s where each data point is sampled from a linear combination of context dependent CDF basis functions. We propose functional ridge-regression-based estimation methods that estimate CDF{}s accurately everywhere. In particular, given $n$ samples with $d$ basis functions, we show estimation error upper bounds of $\\widetilde O(\\sqrt{d/n})$ for fixed design, random design, and adversarial context cases. We also derive matching information theoretic lower bounds, establishing minimax optimality for CDF functional regression. Furthermore, we remove the burn-in time in the random design setting using an alternative penalized estimator. Then, we consider agnostic settings where there is a mismatch in the data generation process. We characterize the error of the proposed estimators in terms of the mismatched error, and show that the estimators are well-behaved under model mismatch. Moreover, to complete our study, we formalize infinite dimensional models where the parameter space is an infinite dimensional Hilbert space, and establish a self-normalized estimation error upper bound for this setting. Notably, the upper bound reduces to the $\\widetilde O(\\sqrt{d/n})$ bound when the parameter space is constrained to be $d$-dimensional.

In contrast, many known properties, such as spatial smoothness or seasonality, are straightforward to model by choosing an appropriate kernel in a Gaussian process (GP). Many deep learning applications could be enhanced by modeling such known properties. For example, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are frequently used in remote sensing, which is subject to strong seasonal effects. We propose to blend the strengths of NNs and the clear modeling capabilities of GPs by using a composite kernel that combines a kernel implicitly defined by a neural network with a second kernel function chosen to model known properties (e.g., seasonality). We implement this idea by combining a deep network and an efficient mapping function based on either Nystrom approximation or random Fourier features, which we call Implicit Composite Kernel (ICK). We then adopt a sample-then-optimize approach to approximate the full GP posterior distribution. We demonstrate that ICK has superior performance and flexibility on both synthetic and real-world datasets including a remote sensing dataset.

Many acquisition functions are (partly) based on the uncertainty that the current model has about the class label of a point, yet there is no generally agreed upon strategy for computing such uncertainty. This paper proposes a new and very simple approach to computing uncertainty in deep active learning with a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The main idea is to use the feature representation extracted by the CNN as data for training a Sum-Product Network (SPN). Since SPNs are typically used for estimating the distribution of a dataset, they are well suited to the task of estimating class probabilities that can be used directly by standard acquisition functions such as max entropy and variational ratio.

More often than not, it involves a three-step process—pre-training, pruning, and re-training—that is computationally expensive, as the dense model must be fully pre-trained. While previous work has revealed through experiments the relationship between the amount of pre-training and the performance of the pruned network, a theoretical characterization of such dependency is still missing. Aiming to mathematically analyze the amount of dense network pre-training needed for a pruned network to perform well, we discover a simple theoretical bound in the number of gradient descent pre-training iterations on a two-layer fully connected network in the NTK regime, beyond which pruning via greedy forward selection \\citep{provable_subnetworks} yields a subnetwork that achieves good training error. Interestingly, this threshold is logarithmically dependent upon the size of the dataset, meaning that experiments with larger datasets require more pre-training for subnetworks obtained via pruning to perform well.

The spectrum and eigenvectors of the induced metric help to identify the most and least significant information captured by PH. Furthermore, the pull-back norm of tangent vectors provides insights about the sensitivity of PH to a given perturbation, or its potential to detect a given feature of interest, and in turn its ability to solve a given classification or regression problem. Experimentally, the insights gained through our methodology align well with the existing knowledge about PH.

We propose a novel deep learning module - MC Layer Normalization - that acts as a drop-in replacement for Layer Normalization blocks and endows a neural network with uncertainty estimation capabilities. Our method is motivated from an approximate Bayesian perspective, but it is simple to deploy with no significant computational overhead thanks to an efficient one-shot approximation of Monte Carlo integration at prediction time. To evaluate the effectiveness of our module, we conduct experiments in two distinct settings. First, we investigate its potential to replace existing methods such as MC-Dropout and Prediction-Time Batch Normalization. Second, we explore its suitability for use cases where such conventional modules are either unsuitable or sub-optimal for certain tasks (as is the case with modules based on Batch Normalization, which is incompatible for instance with transformers).

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation (WSSS) with image-level labels has long been suffering from fragmentary object regions led by Class Activation Map (CAM), which is incapable of generating fine-grained masks for semantic segmentation. To guide CAM to find more non-discriminating object patterns, this paper turns to an interesting working mechanism in agent learning named Complementary Learning System (CLS). CLS holds that the neocortex builds a sensation of general knowledge, while the hippocampus specially learns specific details, completing the learned patterns. Motivated by this simple but effective learning pattern, we propose a General-Specific Learning Mechanism (GSLM) to explicitly drive a coarse-grained CAM to a fine-grained pseudo mask. Specifically, GSLM develops a General Learning Module (GLM) and a Specific Learning Module (SLM). The GLM is trained with image-level supervision to extract coarse and general localization representations from CAM. Based on the general knowledge in the GLM, the SLM progressively exploits the specific spatial knowledge from the localization representations, expanding the CAM in an explicit way. To this end, we propose the Seed Reactivation to help SLM reactivate non-discriminating regions by setting a boundary for activation values, which successively identifies more regions of CAM. Without extra refinement processes, our method is able to achieve improvements for CAM of over 20.0% mIoU on PASCAL VOC 2012 and 10.0% mIoU on MS COCO 2014 datasets, representing a new state-of-the-art among existing WSSS methods.

We build upon this observation by formalizing an algorithm for learning from natural language feedback at training time instead, which we call Imitation learning from Language Feedback (ILF). ILF requires only a small amount of human-written feedback during training and does not require the same feedback at test time, making it both user-friendly and sample-efficient. We further show that ILF can be seen as a form of minimizing the KL divergence to the target distribution and demonstrate proof-of-concepts on text summarization and program synthesis tasks. For code generation, ILF improves a Codegen-Mono 6.1B model's pass@1 rate by 38% relative (and 10% absolute) on the Mostly Basic Python Problems (MBPP) benchmark, outperforming both fine-tuning on MBPP and fine-tuning on repaired programs written by humans. For summarization, we show that ILF can be combined with learning from human preferences to improve a GPT-3 model's summarization performance to be comparable to human quality, outperforming fine-tuning on human-written summaries. Overall, our results suggest that learning from human-written natural language feedback is both more effective and sample-efficient than training exclusively on demonstrations for improving an LLM's performance on a variety of tasks",

    "title": "Manifold Contrastive Learning with Variational Lie Group Operators",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Self-supervised learning of deep neural networks has become a prevalent paradigm for learning representations that transfer to a variety of downstream tasks. Similar to proposed models of the ventral stream of biological vision, it is observed that these networks lead to a separation of category manifolds in the representations of the penultimate layer. Although this observation matches the manifold hypothesis of representation learning, current self-supervised approaches are limited in their ability to explicitly model this manifold. Indeed, current approaches often only apply a pre-specified set of augmentations for \"positive pairs\" during learning. In this work, we propose a contrastive learning approach that directly models the latent manifold using Lie group operators parameterized by coefficients with a sparsity-promoting prior. A variational distribution over these coefficients provides a generative model of the manifold, with samples which provide feature augmentations applicable both during contrastive training and downstream tasks. Additionally, learned coefficient distributions provide a quantification of which transformations are most likely at each point on the manifold while preserving identity. We demonstrate benefits in self-supervised benchmarks for image datasets, as well as a downstream semi-supervised task. In the former case, we demonstrate that the proposed methods can effectively apply manifold feature augmentations and improve learning both with and without a projection head. In the latter case, we demonstrate that feature augmentations sampled from learned Lie group operators can improve classification performance when using few labels",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Learning mapping between two function spaces has attracted considerable research attention. However, learning the solution operator of partial differential equations (PDEs) remains a challenge in scientific computing. Fourier neural operator (FNO) is recently proposed to learn the solution operators with an excellent performance. In this study, we propose a novel pseudo-differential integral operator (PDIO) to analyze and generalize the Fourier integral operator in FNO. PDIO is inspired by a pseudo-differential operator, which is a generalization of a differential operator and characterized by a certain symbol. We parameterize the symbol by using a neural network and show that the neural-network-based symbol is contained in a smooth symbol class. Subsequently, we prove that the PDIO is a bounded linear operator, and thus is continuous in the Sobolev space. We combine the PDIO with the neural operator to develop a pseudo-differential neural operator (PDNO) to learn the nonlinear solution operator of PDEs. We experimentally validate the effectiveness of the proposed model by using Darcy flow and the Navier-Stokes equation. The results reveal that the proposed PDNO outperforms the existing neural operator approaches in most experiments",

However, in this work, we raise the question of whether existing methods are really strong enough by showing that simple baseline methods --such as random forests or linear regressions--, perform on par with advanced graph learning models on several population graph datasets for a variety of different clinical applications.

We (a) investigate the impact of different graph construction methods, graph convolutions, and dataset size and complexity on GNN performance and (b) discuss the utility of GNNs for multi-modal data integration in the context of population graphs.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "In order to create machine learning systems that serve a variety of users well, it is vital to not only achieve high average performance but also ensure equitable outcomes across diverse groups. However, most machine learning methods are designed to improve a model's average performance on a chosen end task without consideration for their impact on worst group error. Multitask learning (MTL) is one such widely used technique. In this paper, we seek not only to understand the impact of MTL on worst-group accuracy but also to explore its potential as a tool to address the challenge of group-wise fairness. We primarily consider the standard setting of fine-tuning a pre-trained model, where, following recent work \\citep{gururangan2020don, dery2023aang}, we multitask the end task with the pre-training objective constructed from the end task data itself. In settings with few or no group annotations, we find that multitasking often, but not consistently, achieves better worst-group accuracy than Just-Train-Twice (JTT; \\citet{pmlr-v139-liu21f}) -- a representative distributionally robust optimization (DRO) method. Leveraging insights from synthetic data experiments, we propose to modify standard MTL by regularizing the joint multitask representation space. We run a large number of fine-tuning experiments across computer vision and natural language processing datasets and find that our regularized MTL approach \\emph{consistently} outperforms JTT on both average and worst-group outcomes.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Selective prediction aims to learn a reliable model that abstains from making predictions when uncertain. These predictions can then be deferred to humans for further evaluation. As an everlasting challenge for machine learning, in many real-world scenarios, the distribution of test data is different from the training data. This results in more inaccurate predictions, and often increased dependence on humans, which can be difficult and expensive. Active learning aims to lower the overall labeling effort, and hence human dependence, by querying the most informative examples. Selective prediction and active learning have been approached from different angles, with the connection between them missing. In this work, we introduce a new learning paradigm, active selective prediction, which aims to query more informative samples from the shifted target domain while increasing accuracy and coverage. For this new paradigm, we propose a simple yet effective approach, ASPEST, that utilizes ensembles of model snapshots with self-training with their aggregated outputs as pseudo labels. Extensive experiments on numerous image, text and structured datasets, which suffer from domain shifts, demonstrate that ASPEST can significantly outperform prior work on selective prediction and active learning (e.g. on the MNIST$\\to$SVHN benchmark with the labeling budget of 100, ASPEST improves the AUACC metric from 79.36% to 88.84%) and achieves more optimal utilization of humans in the loop",

In this work, we tackle simpler \"statistical component separation\" problems that focus on recovering a predefined set of statistical descriptors of a target signal from a noisy mixture. Assuming access to samples of the noise process, we investigate a method devised to match the statistics of the solution candidate corrupted by noise samples with those of the observed mixture. We first analyze the behavior of this method using simple examples with analytically tractable calculations. Then, we apply it in an image denoising context employing 1) wavelet-based descriptors, 2) ConvNet-based descriptors on astrophysics and ImageNet data. In the case of 1), we show that our method better recovers the descriptors of the target data than a standard denoising method in most situations. Additionally, despite not constructed for this purpose, it performs surprisingly well in terms of peak signal-to-noise ratio on full signal reconstruction. In comparison, representation 2) appears less suitable for image denoising. Finally, we extend this method by introducing a diffusive stepwise algorithm which gives a new perspective to the initial method and leads to promising results for image denoising under specific circumstances",

    "abstract": "Online model selection involves selecting a model from a set of candidate models `on the fly' to perform prediction on a stream of data. The choice of candidate models henceforth has a crucial impact on the performance. Although employing a larger set of candidate models naturally leads to more flexibility in model selection, this may be infeasible in cases where prediction tasks are performed on edge devices with limited memory. Faced with this challenge, the present paper proposes an online federated model selection framework where a group of learners (clients) interacts with a server with sufficient memory such that the server stores all candidate models. However, each client only chooses to store a subset of models that can be fit into its memory and performs its own prediction task using one of the stored models. Furthermore, employing the proposed algorithm, clients and the server collaborate to fine-tune models to adapt them to a non-stationary environment. Theoretical analysis proves that the proposed algorithm enjoys sub-linear regret with respect to the best model in hindsight. Experiments on real datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "To enable video models to be applied seamlessly across video tasks in different environments, various Video Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (VUDA) methods have been proposed to improve the robustness and transferability of video models. Despite improvements made in model robustness, these VUDA methods require access to both source data and source model parameters for adaptation, raising serious data privacy and model portability issues. To cope with the above concerns, this paper firstly formulates Black-box Video Domain Adaptation (BVDA) as a more realistic yet challenging scenario where the source video model is provided only as a black-box predictor. While a few methods for Black-box Domain Adaptation (BDA) are proposed in the image domain, these methods cannot apply to the video domain since video modality has more complicated temporal features that are harder to align. To address BVDA, we propose a novel Endo and eXo-TEmporal Regularized Network (EXTERN) by applying mask-to-mix strategies and video-tailored regularizations. They are the endo-temporal regularization and exo-temporal regularization, which are performed across both clip and temporal features, while distilling knowledge from the predictions obtained from the black-box predictor. Empirical results demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of EXTERN across various cross-domain closed-set and partial-set action recognition benchmarks, which even surpasses most existing video domain adaptation methods with source data accessibility.

    "abstract": "Scientific Machine Learning (SciML) is a burgeoning field that synergistically combines domain-aware and interpretable models with agnostic machine learning techniques. In this work, we introduce GOKU-UI, an evolution of the SciML generative model GOKU-nets. GOKU-UI not only broadens the original model's spectrum to incorporate other classes of differential equations, such as Stochastic Differential Equations (SDEs), but also integrates attention mechanisms and a novel multiple shooting training strategy in the latent space. These modifications have led to a significant increase in its performance in both reconstruction and forecast tasks, as demonstrated by our evaluation on simulated and empirical data. Specifically, GOKU-UI outperformed all baseline models on synthetic datasets even with a training set 16-fold smaller, underscoring its remarkable data efficiency. Furthermore, when applied to empirical human brain data, while incorporating stochastic Stuart-Landau oscillators into its dynamical core, our proposed enhancements markedly increased the model's effectiveness in capturing complex brain dynamics. GOKU-UI demonstrated a reconstruction error five times lower than other baselines, and the multiple shooting method reduced the GOKU-nets prediction error for future brain activity up to 15 seconds ahead. By training GOKU-UI on resting state fMRI data, we encoded whole-brain dynamics into a latent representation, learning a low-dimensional dynamical system model that could offer insights into brain functionality and open avenues for practical applications such as the classification of mental states or psychiatric conditions.

    "abstract": "Deep neural network autoencoders are routinely used computationally for model reduction. They allow recognizing the intrinsic dimension of data that lie in a $k$-dimensional subset $K$ of an input Euclidean space $\\mathbb{R}^n$. The underlying idea is to obtain both an encoding layer that maps $\\mathbb{R}^n$ into $\\mathbb{R}^k$ (called the bottleneck layer or the space of latent variables) and a decoding layer that maps $\\mathbb{R}^k$ back into $\\mathbb{R}^n$, in such a way that the input data from the set $K$ is recovered when composing the two maps. This is achieved by adjusting parameters (weights) in the network to minimize the discrepancy between the input and the reconstructed output. Since neural networks (with continuous activation functions) compute continuous maps, the existence of a network that achieves perfect reconstruction would imply that $K$ is homeomorphic to a $k$-dimensional subset of $\\mathbb{R}^k$, so clearly there are topological obstructions to finding such a network. On the other hand, in practice the technique is found to ``work'' well, which leads one to ask if there is a way to explain this effectiveness. We show that, up to small errors, indeed the method is guaranteed to work. This is done by appealing to certain facts from differential topology.

In this paper, we present a novel optimization anomaly called the \\emph{Slingshot Effect}, which manifests during extremely late stages of training. We identify a distinctive characteristic of this phenomenon through cyclic phase transitions between stable and unstable training regimes, as evidenced by the cyclic behavior of the norm of the last layer's weights. Although the Slingshot Effect can be easily reproduced in more general settings, it does not align with any known optimization theories, emphasizing the need for in-depth examination. Moreover, we make a noteworthy observation that Grokking, as reported by ~\\citet{power2021grokking}, occurs predominantly during the onset of the Slingshot Effects and is absent without it, even in the absence of explicit regularization. This finding suggests a surprising inductive bias of adaptive gradient optimizers at late training stages, urging a revised theoretical analysis of their origin.

    "abstract": "Extracting Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) on video data poses unique challenges due to the additional temporal dimension. In the context of videos, INRs have predominantly relied on a frame-only parameterization, which sacrifices the spatiotemporal continuity observed in pixel-level (spatial) representations. To mitigate this, we introduce Polynomial Neural Representation for Videos (PNeRV), a parameter-wise efficient, patch-wise INR for videos that preserves spatiotemporal continuity. PNeRV leverages the modeling capabilities of Polynomial Neural Networks to perform the modulation of a continuous spatial (patch) signal with a continuous time (frame) signal. We further propose a custom Hierarchical Patch-wise Spatial Sampling Scheme that ensures spatial continuity while retaining parameter efficiency. We also employ a carefully designed Positional Embedding methodology to further enhance PNeRV's performance. Our extensive experimentation demonstrates that PNeRV outperforms the baselines in conventional Implicit Neural Representation tasks like compression along with downstream applications that require spatiotemporal continuity in the underlying representation. PNeRV not only addresses the challenges posed by video data in the realm of INRs but also opens new avenues for advanced video processing and analysis",

We focus on combining Bayesian deep learning with split conformal prediction and how the addition of conformal prediction affects out-of-distribution coverage that we would otherwise see; particularly in the case of multiclass image classification. We suggest that if the model is generally underconfident on the calibration set, then the resultant conformal sets may exhibit worse out-of-distribution coverage compared to simple predictive credible sets (i.e. not using conformal prediction). Conversely, if the model is overconfident on the calibration set, the use of conformal prediction may improve out-of-distribution coverage. In particular, we study the extent to which the addition of conformal prediction increases or decreases out-of-distribution coverage for a variety of inference techniques. In particular, (i) stochastic gradient descent, (ii) deep ensembles, (iii) mean-field variational inference, (iv) stochastic gradient Hamiltonian Monte Carlo, and (v) Laplace approximation.

    "abstract": "In many bandit problems, the maximal reward achievable by a policy is often unknown in advance. We consider the problem of estimating the optimal policy value in the sublinear data regime before the optimal policy is even learnable. We refer to this as $V^*$ estimation. It was previously shown that fast $V^*$ estimation is possible but only in disjoint linear bandits with Gaussian covariates. Whether this is possible for more realistic context distributions has remained an open and important question for tasks such as model selection. In this paper, we first provide lower bounds showing that this general problem is hard. However, under stronger assumptions, we give an algorithm and analysis proving that $\\widetilde{\\mathcal{O}}(\\sqrt{d})$ sublinear estimation of $V^*$ is indeed information-theoretically possible, where $d$ is the dimension. We subsequently introduce a practical and computationally efficient algorithm that estimates a problem-specific upper bound on $V^*$, valid for general distributions and tight for Gaussian context distributions. We prove our algorithm requires only $\\widetilde{\\mathcal{O}}(\\sqrt{d})$ samples to estimate the upper bound. We use this upper bound in conjunction with the estimator to derive novel and improved guarantees for several applications in bandit model selection and testing for treatment effects.

In this work, we propose a new convolution kernel that effectively rewires the graph according to the occupation correlations of the vertices by trading on the generalized diffusion paradigm for the propagation of a quantum particle over the graph. We term this new convolution kernel the Quantum Diffusion Convolution (QDC) operator. In addition, we introduce a multiscale variant that combines messages from the QDC operator and the traditional combinatorial Laplacian. To understand our method, we explore the spectral dependence of homophily and the importance of quantum dynamics in the construction of a bandpass filter.

We present a novel approach to tackle these issues by restricting DIP optimisation to a sparse linear subspace of its parameters, employing a synergy of dimensionality reduction techniques and second order optimisation methods. The low-dimensionality of the subspace reduces DIP's tendency to fit noise and allows the use of stable second order optimisation methods, e.g., natural gradient descent or L-BFGS. Experiments across both image restoration and tomographic tasks of different geometry and ill-posedness show that second order optimisation within a low-dimensional subspace is favourable in terms of optimisation stability to reconstruction fidelity trade-off",

Our approach reduces the computational overhead of constructing a large kernel matrix and more importantly, eliminates the ambiguity of factorizing the matrix. Due to the low-rank structure in CCNNs and the related subdifferential of nuclear norms, there is no closed-form expression to recover the primal solution from the dual solution. To overcome this, we propose a highly novel weight recovery algorithm, which takes the dual solution and the kernel information as the input, and recovers the linear weight and the output of convolutional layer, instead of weight parameter. Furthermore, our recovery algorithm exploits the low-rank structure and imposes a small number of filters indirectly, which reduces the parameter size. As a result, DCCNNs inherit all the statistical benefits of CCNNs, while enjoying a more formal and efficient workflow",

We design natural-language navigation tasks and evaluate the ability of LLMs, in particular GPT-3.5-turbo, GPT-4, and Llama2 series models, to represent and reason about spatial structures. We also compare these abilities to human performance on the same tasks. These tasks reveal substantial variability in LLM performance across different spatial structures, including square, hexagonal, and triangular grids, rings, and trees.

Owing to this simple yet provably valid stationarity detection, SplitSGD is easy-to-implement and essentially does not incur additional computational cost than standard SGD. Through a series of extensive experiments, we show that this method is appropriate for both convex problems and training (non-convex) neural networks, with performance compared favorably to other stochastic optimization methods. Importantly, this method is observed to be very robust with a set of default parameters for a wide range of problems and, moreover, can yield better generalization performance than other adaptive gradient methods such as Adam",

Our method is naturally robust to the problems of client failure, model poisoning, and straggling clients.

We require the number of distributed clients to be logarithmic in the dimension of the problem.

Secondly, we introduce a threshold-free sample weighting strategy to exploit better both high and low confidence pseudo-labels. Furthermore, we utilize normalizing flows to model, in an unsupervised fashion, the distribution of unlabeled data.

    "abstract": "Compared to on-policy counterparts, off-policy model-free deep reinforcement learning can improve data efficiency by repeatedly using the previously gathered data. However, off-policy learning becomes challenging when the discrepancy between the underlying distributions of the agent's policy and collected data increases. Although the well-studied importance sampling and off-policy policy gradient techniques were proposed to compensate for this discrepancy, they usually require a collection of long trajectories and induce additional problems such as vanishing/exploding gradients or discarding many useful experiences, which eventually increases the computational complexity. Moreover, their generalization to either continuous action domains or policies approximated by deterministic deep neural networks is strictly limited. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a novel policy similarity measure to mitigate the effects of such discrepancy in continuous control. Our method offers an adequate single-step off-policy correction that is applicable to deterministic policy networks.

    "abstract": "As a popular paradigm of distributed learning, personalized federated learning (PFL) allows personalized models to improve generalization ability and robustness by utilizing knowledge from all distributed clients. Most existing PFL algorithms tackle personalization in a model-centric way, such as personalized layer partition, model regularization, and model interpolation, which all fail to take into account the data characteristics of distributed clients. In this paper, we propose a novel PFL framework for image classification tasks, dubbed pFedPT, that leverages personalized visual prompts to implicitly represent local data distribution information of clients and provides that information to the aggregation model to help with classification tasks. Specifically, in each round of pFedPT training, each client generates a local personalized prompt related to local data distribution. Then, the local model is trained on the input composed of raw data and a visual prompt to learn the distribution information contained in the prompt. During model testing, the aggregated model obtains client-specific knowledge of the data distributions based on the prompts, which can be seen as an adaptive fine-tuning of the aggregation model to improve model performances on different clients. Furthermore, the visual prompt can be added as an orthogonal method to implement personalization on the client for existing FL methods to boost their performance. Experiments on the CIFAR10 and CIFAR100 datasets show that pFedPT outperforms several state-of-the-art (SOTA) PFL algorithms by a large margin in various settings.

    "abstract": "While Contrastive Learning (CL) achieves great success in many downstream tasks, its good performance heavily relies on a large model capacity. As previous methods focus on scaling dense models, training and inference costs increase rapidly with model sizes, leading to large resource consumption. In this paper, we explore CL with an efficient scaling method, Mixture of Experts (MoE), to obtain a large but sparse model. We start by plugging in the state-of-the-art CL method to MoE. However, this naive combination fails to visibly improve performance despite a much larger capacity. A closer look reveals that the naive MoE+CL model has a strong tendency to route two augmented views of the same image token to different subsets of experts: such ``cross-view instability\" breaks the weight-sharing nature in CL and misleads the invariant feature learning. To address this issue, we introduce a new regularization mechanism, by enforcing expert-routing similarity between different views of the same image (or its overlapped patch tokens), while promoting expert-routing diversity of patches from different images. The resultant method, called CR-MoE, improves by 1.7 points in terms of 1\\% semi-supervised learning accuracy on ImageNet, compared to the naive combination baseline. It further surpasses the state-of-the-art CL methods on ImageNet pre-training of Vision Transformer (ViT) by 2.8 points, at the same computational cost.

Flow matching methods have recently further extended these ODE-based approaches and approximate a flow between two arbitrary probability distributions. Previous work derived bounds on the approximation error of diffusion models under the stochastic sampling regime, given assumptions on the $L^2$ loss. We present error bounds for the flow matching procedure using fully deterministic sampling, assuming an $L^2$ bound on the approximation error and a certain regularity condition on the data distributions",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "The analysis of gradient descent-type methods typically relies on the Lipschitz continuity of the objective gradient. This generally requires an expensive hyperparameter tuning process to appropriately calibrate a stepsize for a given problem. In this work we introduce a local first-order smoothness oracle (LFSO) which generalizes the Lipschitz continuous gradients smoothness condition and is applicable to any twice-differentiable function. We show that this oracle can encode all relevant problem information for tuning stepsizes for a suitably modified gradient descent method and give global and local convergence results. We also show that LFSOs in this modified first-order method can yield global linear convergence rates for non-strongly convex problems with extremely flat minima, and thus improve over the lower bound on rates achievable by general (accelerated) first-order methods",

    "abstract": "When analyzing real-world data it is common to work with event ensembles, which comprise sets of observations that collectively constrain the parameters of an underlying model of interest. Such models often have a hierarchical structure, where ``local'' parameters impact individual events and ``global'' parameters influence the entire dataset. We introduce practical approaches for frequentist and Bayesian dataset-wide probabilistic inference in cases where the likelihood is intractable, but simulations can be realized via a hierarchical forward model. We construct neural estimators for the likelihood(-ratio) or posterior and show that explicitly accounting for the model's hierarchical structure can lead to significantly tighter parameter constraints. We ground our discussion using case studies from the physical sciences, focusing on examples from particle physics and cosmology",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Various methods for Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) have been developed with the assumption that agents' policies are based on accurate state information. However, policies learned through Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) are susceptible to adversarial state perturbation attacks. In this work, we propose a State-Adversarial Markov Game (SAMG) and make the first attempt to investigate different solution concepts of MARL under state uncertainties. Our analysis shows that the commonly used solution concepts of optimal agent policy and robust Nash equilibrium do not always exist in SAMGs. To circumvent this difficulty, we consider a new solution concept called robust agent policy, where agents aim to maximize the worst-case expected state value. We prove the existence of robust agent policy for finite state and finite action SAMGs. Additionally, we propose a Robust Multi-Agent Adversarial Actor-Critic (RMA3C) algorithm to learn robust policies for MARL agents under state uncertainties. Our experiments demonstrate that our algorithm outperforms existing methods when faced with state perturbations and greatly improves the robustness of MARL policies.

    "abstract": "We introduce MESSY estimation, a Maximum-Entropy based Stochastic and Symbolic densitY estimation method. The proposed approach recovers probability density functions symbolically from samples using moments of a Gradient flow in which the ansatz serves as the driving force. In particular, we construct a gradient-based drift-diffusion process that connects samples of the unknown distribution function to a guess symbolic expression. We then show that when the guess distribution has the maximum entropy form, the parameters of this distribution can be found efficiently by solving a linear system of equations constructed using the moments of the provided samples. Furthermore, we use Symbolic regression to explore the space of smooth functions and find optimal basis functions for the exponent of the maximum entropy functional leading to good conditioning. The cost of the proposed method for each set of selected basis functions is linear with the number of samples and quadratic with the number of basis functions. However, the underlying acceptance/rejection procedure for finding optimal and well-conditioned bases adds to the computational cost. We validate the proposed MESSY estimation method against other benchmark methods for the case of a bi-modal and a discontinuous density, as well as a density at the limit of physical realizability. We find that the addition of a symbolic search for basis functions improves the accuracy of the estimation at a reasonable additional computational cost. Our results suggest that the proposed method outperforms existing density recovery methods in the limit of a small to moderate number of samples by providing a low-bias and tractable symbolic description of the unknown density at a reasonable computational cost",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Modern data aggregation often involves a platform collecting data from a network of users with various privacy options. Platforms must solve the problem of how to allocate incentives to users to convince them to share their data. This paper puts forth an idea for a fair amount to compensate users for their data at a given privacy level based on an axiomatic definition of fairness, along the lines of the celebrated Shapley value. To the best of our knowledge, these are the first fairness concepts for data that explicitly consider privacy constraints. We also formulate a heterogeneous federated learning problem for the platform with privacy level options for users. By studying this problem, we investigate the amount of compensation users receive under fair allocations with different privacy levels, amounts of data, and degrees of heterogeneity. We also discuss what happens when the platform is forced to design fair incentives. Under certain conditions we find that when privacy sensitivity is low, the platform will set incentives to ensure that it collects all the data with the lowest privacy options. When the privacy sensitivity is above a given threshold, the platform will provide no incentives to users. Between these two extremes, the platform will set the incentives so some fraction of the users chooses the higher privacy option and the others chooses the lower privacy option",

    "abstract": "Deep Neural Networks often inherit spurious correlations embedded in training data and hence may fail to generalize to unseen domains, which have different distributions from the domain to provide training data. M. Arjovsky et al. (2019) introduced the concept out-of-distribution (o.o.d.) risk, which is the maximum risk among all domains, and formulated the issue caused by spurious correlations as a minimization problem of the o.o.d. risk. Invariant Risk Minimization (IRM) is considered to be a promising approach to minimize the o.o.d. risk: IRM estimates a minimum of the o.o.d. risk by solving a bi-level optimization problem. While IRM has attracted considerable attention with empirical success, it comes with few theoretical guarantees. Especially, a solid theoretical guarantee that the bi-level optimization problem gives the minimum of the o.o.d. risk has not yet been established. Aiming at providing a theoretical justification for IRM, this paper rigorously proves that a solution to the bi-level optimization problem minimizes the o.o.d. risk under certain conditions. The result also provides sufficient conditions on distributions providing training data and on a dimension of feature space for the bi-leveled optimization problem to minimize the o.o.d. risk",

Unlike single-objective optimization, game dynamics involve complex interactions reflected by the eigenvalues of the game vector field's Jacobian scattered across the complex plane. This complexity can cause the simple gradient method to diverge, even for bilinear games, while the extragradient method achieves convergence. Building on the recently proven accelerated convergence of the momentum extragradient method for bilinear games \\citep{azizian2020accelerating}, we use a polynomial-based analysis to identify three distinct scenarios where this method exhibits further accelerated convergence. These scenarios encompass situations where the eigenvalues reside on the (positive) real line, lie on the real line alongside complex conjugates, or exist solely as complex conjugates. Furthermore, we derive the hyperparameters for each scenario that achieve the fastest convergence rate",

To address these issues, we propose a novel approach called Introspective Experience Replay (IER) that selectively samples batches of data points prior to surprising events. Our method is inspired from the reverse experience replay (RER) technique, which has been shown to reduce bias in the output of Q-learning-type algorithms with linear function approximation. However, RER is not always practically reliable when using neural function approximation. Through empirical evaluations, we demonstrate that IER with neural function approximation yields reliable and superior performance compared to UER, PER, and hindsight experience replay (HER) across most tasks",

This data spans a large repertoire of motor control skills from simulated and real robotic arms with varying sets of observations and actions. With RoboCat, we demonstrate the ability to generalise to new tasks and robots, both zero-shot as well as through adaptation using only 100–1000 examples for the target task. We also show how a trained model itself can be used to generate data for subsequent training iterations, thus providing a basic building block for an autonomous improvement loop. We investigate the agent's capabilities, with large-scale evaluations both in simulation and on three different real robot embodiments. We find that as we grow and diversify its training data, RoboCat not only shows signs of cross-task transfer, but also becomes more efficient at adapting to new tasks",

In sparse linear bandits, the unknown feature vector $\\theta^*$ may be of large dimension $d$, but only a few, say $s \\ll d$ of these features have non-zero values. We design a two-phase algorithm, Lasso and Optimal-Design- (Lasso-OD) based linear best-arm identification. The first phase of Lasso-OD leverages the sparsity of the feature vector by applying the thresholded Lasso introduced by Zhou (2009), which estimates the support of $\\theta^*$ correctly with high probability using rewards from the selected arms and a judicious choice of the design matrix. The second phase of Lasso-OD applies the OD-LinBAI algorithm by Yang and Tan (2022) on that estimated support. We derive a non-asymptotic upper bound on the error probability of Lasso-OD by carefully choosing hyperparameters (such as Lasso's regularization parameter) and balancing the error probabilities of both phases. For fixed sparsity $s$ and budget $T$, the exponent in the error probability of Lasso-OD depends on $s$ but not on the dimension $d$, yielding a significant performance improvement for sparse and high-dimensional linear bandits. Furthermore, we show that Lasso-OD is almost minimax optimal in the exponent. Finally, we provide numerical examples to demonstrate the significant performance improvement over the existing algorithms for non-sparse linear bandits such as OD-LinBAI, BayesGap, Peace, LinearExploration, and GSE",

Recently, LN has been shown to be surprisingly effective in federated learning (FL) with non-i.i.d. data. However, exactly why and how it works remains mysterious. In this work, we reveal the profound connection between layer normalization and the label shift problem in federated learning. To understand layer normalization better in FL, we identify the key contributing mechanism of normalization methods in FL, called feature normalization (FN), which applies normalization to the latent feature representation before the classifier head. Although LN and FN do not improve expressive power, they control feature collapse and local overfitting to heavily skewed datasets, and thus accelerates global training. Empirically, we show that normalization leads to drastic improvements on standard benchmarks under extreme label shift. Moreover, we conduct extensive ablation studies to understand the critical factors of layer normalization in FL. Our results verify that FN is an essential ingredient inside LN to significantly improve the convergence of FL while remaining robust to learning rate choices, especially under extreme label shift where each client has access to few classes",

This dichotomy is present during both training and inference, which requires the proper handling of uninformative data during both training and testing. We propose a novel approach to learning under these conditions via a loss inspired by the selective learning theory. By minimizing this loss, the model is guaranteed to make a near-optimal decision by distinguishing informative data from uninformative data and making predictions.

However, existing datasets for PDE surrogates offer only limited coverage of the wave propagation phenomenon.

Given a trained model using too little annotated data, we compute poses in consecutive frames along with the optical flow between them. We then enforce consistency between the image optical flow and the one that can be inferred from the change in pose from one frame to the next.

GPT-4 solves only 13/50 of the most straightforward ARC tasks when using textual encodings for their two-dimensional input-output grids. Our failure analysis reveals that GPT-4's capacity to identify objects and reason about them is significantly influenced by the sequential nature of the text that represents an object within a text encoding of a task. To test this hypothesis, we design a new benchmark, the 1D-ARC, which consists of one-dimensional (array-like) tasks that are more conducive to GPT-based reasoning, and where it indeed performs better than on the (2D) ARC. To alleviate this issue, we propose an object-based representation that is obtained through an external tool, resulting in nearly doubling the performance on solved ARC tasks and near-perfect scores on the easier 1D-ARC. Although the state-of-the-art GPT-4 is unable to \"reason\" perfectly within non-language domains such as the 1D-ARC or a simple ARC subset, our study reveals that the use of object-based representations can significantly improve its reasoning ability.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Composed image retrieval aims to find an image that best matches a given multi-modal user query consisting of a reference image and text pair. Existing methods commonly pre-compute image embeddings over the entire corpus and compare these to a reference image embedding modified by the query text at test time. Such a pipeline is very efficient at test time since fast vector distances can be used to evaluate candidates, but modifying the reference image embedding guided only by a short textual description can be difficult, especially independent of potential candidates. An alternative approach is to allow interactions between the query and every possible candidate, i.e., reference-text-candidate triplets, and pick the best from the entire set. Though this approach is more discriminative, for large-scale datasets the computational cost is prohibitive since pre-computation of candidate embeddings is no longer possible. We propose to combine the merits of both schemes using a two-stage model. Our first stage adopts the conventional vector distancing metric and performs a fast pruning among candidates. Meanwhile, our second stage employs a dual-encoder architecture, which effectively attends to the input triplet of reference-text-candidate and re-ranks the candidates. Both stages utilize a vision-and-language pre-trained network, which has proven beneficial for various downstream tasks. Our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on standard benchmarks for the task. Our implementation is available at https://github.com/Cuberick-Orion/Candidate-Reranking-CIR",

If these are small, then the model generalizes. To make this conclusion rigorous, we weaken the notion of uniform stability of a learning algorithm in a probabilistic way by positing the notion of almost sure (a.s.) support stability and showing that algorithms that have this form of stability have generalization error tending to 0 as the training set size increases. Further, we show that for Stochastic Gradient Descent to be a.s. support stable we only need the loss function to be a.s. locally Lipschitz and locally Smooth at the training points, thereby showing low generalization error with weaker conditions than have been used in the literature. We then show that Neural Networks with ReLU activation and a doubly differentiable loss function possess these properties. Our notion of stability is the first data-dependent notion to be able to show good generalization bounds for non-convex functions with learning rates strictly slower than $1/t$ at the $t$-th step. Finally, we present experimental evidence to validate our theoretical results",

We propose two types of self-consistency that are particularly important for multi-step reasoning -- hypothetical consistency (a model's ability to predict what its output would be in a hypothetical other context) and compositional consistency (consistency of a model's final outputs when intermediate sub-steps are replaced with the model's outputs for those steps).

These training functions are typically required to have the same domain as the \"test\" function (black-box function to be optimized). In this paper, we introduce MPHD, a model pre-training method on heterogeneous domains, which uses a neural net mapping from domain-specific contexts to specifications of hierarchical GPs.

    "abstract": "Tensor data are becoming important recently in various applications, e.g., image and video recognition, which pose new challenges for data modeling and analysis approaches, such as high-order relations of large complexity, varying data scale and gross noise. In this paper, we consider the problem of sparse canonical correlation analysis for arbitrary tensor data. Although several methods have been proposed for this task, there are still limitations hindering its practical applications. To this end, we present a general Sparse Tensor Canonical Correlation Analysis (gSTCCA) method from a multilinear least-squares perspective. Specifically, we formulate the problem as a constrained multilinear least-squares problem with tensor-structured sparsity regularization based on CANDECOMP/PARAFAC (CP) decomposition. Then we present a divide-and-conquer deflation approach to tackle the problem by successive rank-one tensor estimation of the residual tensors, where the overall model is broken up into a set of unconstrained linear least-squares problems that can be efficiently solved. Through extensive experiments conducted on five different datasets for recognition tasks, we demonstrate that the proposed method achieves promising performance compared to the SOTA vector- and tensor-based canonical correlation analysis methods in terms of classification accuracy, model sparsity, and robustness to missing and noisy data.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Interpretable models are gaining increasing attention in the machine learning community, and significant progress is being made to develop simple, interpretable, yet powerful deep learning approaches. Generalized Additive Models (GAM) and Neural Additive Models (NAM) are prime examples. Despite these methods' great potential and popularity in critical applications, e.g., medical applications, they fail to generalize to distributions with more than one mode (multimodal\\footnote{In this paper, multimodal refers to the context of distributions, wherein a distribution possesses more than one mode.}). The main reason behind this limitation is that these \"all-fit-one\" models collapse multiple relationships by being forced to fit the data unimodally. We address this critical limitation by proposing interpretable multimodal network frameworks capable of learning a Mixture of Neural Additive Models (MNAM). The proposed MNAM learns relationships between input features and outputs in a multimodal fashion and assigns a probability to each mode. The proposed method shares similarities with Mixture Density Networks (MDN) while keeping the interpretability that characterizes GAM and NAM. We demonstrate how the proposed MNAM balances between rich representations and interpretability with numerous empirical observations and pedagogical studies. We present and discuss different training alternatives and provided extensive practical evaluation to assess the proposed framework.

We consider a common setting where a short sequence is read out repeatedly using a high-throughput long-read platform to generate multiple subreads, or noisy obser- vations of the same sequence. Denoising these subreads with alignment-based approaches often fails when too few subreads are available or error rates are too high. In this paper, we propose a novel method for blindly denoising sets of sequences without directly observing clean source sequence labels. Our method, Self-Supervised Set Learning (SSSL), gathers subreads together in an embedding space and estimates a single set embedding as the mid- point of the subreads in both the latent and sequence spaces. This set embedding represents the \"average\" of the subreads and can be decoded into a prediction of the clean sequence. In experiments on simulated long-read DNA data, SSSL methods denoise small reads of ≤ 6 subreads with 17% fewer errors and large reads of > 6 subreads with 8% fewer errors compared to the best baseline. On a real dataset of antibody sequences, SSSL improves over baselines on two self-supervised metrics, with a significant improvement on difficult small reads that comprise over 60% of the test set. By accurately denoising these reads, SSSL promises to better realize the potential of high-throughput DNA sequencing data for downstream scientific applications",

Motivated by this observation, GraphCG learns the steerable factors via maximizing the mutual information between semantic-rich directions, where the controlled graph moving along the same direction will share the same steerable factors. We quantitatively verify that GraphCG outperforms four competitive baselines on two graph DGMs pretrained on two molecule datasets.

MEG is a neurophysiological technique used to investigate a variety of cognitive processes such as language and learning, and an emerging technology in the quest to identify neural correlates of cognitive impairments such as those occurring in dementia. Recent work has shown that it is possible to apply deep learning to MEG to categorise induced responses to stimuli across subjects. While novel in the application of deep learning, such work has generally used relatively simple neural network (NN) models compared to those being used in domains such as computer vision and natural language processing. In these other domains, there is a long history in developing complex NN models that combine spatial and temporal information. We propose more complex NN models that focus on modelling temporal relationships in the data, and apply them to the challenges of MEG data. We apply these models to an extended range of MEG-based tasks, and find that they substantially outperform existing work on a range of tasks, particularly but not exclusively temporally-oriented ones. We also show that an autoencoder-based preprocessing component that focuses on the temporal aspect of the data can improve the performance of existing models.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "We consider convex-concave saddle point problems, and more generally convex optimization problems we refer to as saddle problems, which include the partial supremum or infimum of convex-concave saddle functions. Saddle problems arise in a wide range of applications, including game theory, machine learning, and finance. It is well known that a saddle problem can be reduced to a single convex optimization problem by dualizing either the convex (min) or concave (max) objectives, reducing a min-max problem into a min-min (or max-max) problem. Carrying out this conversion by hand can be tedious and error prone. In this paper we introduce disciplined saddle programming (DSP), a domain specific language (DSL) for specifying saddle problems, for which the dualizing trick can be automated. The language and methods are based on recent work by Juditsky and Nemirovski, who developed the idea of conic-representable saddle point programs, and showed how to carry out the required dualization automatically using conic duality. Juditsky and Nemirovski's conic representation of saddle problems extends Nesterov and Nemirovski's earlier development of conic representable convex problems; DSP can be thought of as extending disciplined convex programming (DCP) to saddle problems. Just as DCP makes it easy for users to formulate and solve complex convex problems, DSP allows users to easily formulate and solve saddle problems. Our method is implemented in an open-source package, also called DSP",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Federated learning uses a set of techniques to efficiently distribute the training of a machine learning algorithm across several devices, who own the training data. These techniques critically rely on reducing the communication cost---the main bottleneck---between the devices and a central server. Federated learning algorithms usually take an optimization approach: they are algorithms for minimizing the training loss subject to communication (and other) constraints. In this work, we instead take a Bayesian approach for the training task, and propose a communication-efficient variant of the Langevin algorithm to sample \\textit{a posteriori}. The latter approach is more robust and provides more knowledge of the \\textit{a posteriori} distribution than its optimization counterpart. We analyze our algorithm without assuming that the target distribution is strongly log-concave. Instead, we assume the weaker log Sobolev inequality, which allows for nonconvexity",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Efficient generation of 3D conformations of a molecule from its 2D graph is a key challenge in in-silico drug discovery. Deep learning (DL) based generative modelling has recently become a potent tool to tackling this challenge. However, many existing DL-based methods are either indirect–leveraging inter-atomic distances or direct–but requiring numerous sampling steps to generate conformations. In this work, we propose a simple model abbreviated TensorVAE capable of generating conformations directly from a 2D molecular graph in a single step. The main novelty of the proposed method is focused on feature engineering. We develop a novel encoding and feature extraction mechanism relying solely on standard convolution operation to generate token-like feature vector for each atom. These feature vectors are then transformed through standard transformer encoders under a conditional Variational Autoencoder framework for generating conformations directly. We show through experiments on two benchmark datasets that with intuitive feature engineering, a relatively simple and standard model can provide promising generative capability outperforming more than a dozen state-of-the-art models employing more sophisticated and specialized generative architecture",

    "abstract": "Masked Image Modeling (MIM) has achieved promising progress with the advent of Masked Autoencoders (MAE) and BEiT. However, subsequent works have complicated the framework with new auxiliary tasks or extra pre-trained models, inevitably increasing computational overhead. This paper undertakes a fundamental analysis of MIM from the perspective of pixel reconstruction, which examines the input image patches and reconstruction target, and highlights two critical but previously overlooked bottlenecks. Based on this analysis, we propose a remarkably simple and effective method, PixMIM, that entails two strategies: 1) filtering the high-frequency components from the reconstruction target to de-emphasize the network's focus on texture-rich details and 2) adopting a conservative data transform strategy to alleviate the problem of missing foreground in MIM training. PixMIM can be easily integrated into most existing pixel-based MIM approaches (i.e., using raw images as reconstruction target) with negligible additional computation. Without bells and whistles, our method consistently improves four MIM approaches, MAE, MFF, ConvMAE, and LSMAE, across various downstream tasks. We believe this effective plug-and-play method will serve as a strong baseline for self-supervised learning and provide insights for future improvements of the MIM framework.

    "abstract": "We study the unbalanced optimal transport (UOT) problem, where the marginal constraints are enforced using Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) regularization. Our work is motivated by the observation that the literature on UOT is focused on regularization based on $\\phi$-divergence (e.g., KL divergence). Despite the popularity of MMD, its role as a regularizer in the context of UOT seems less understood. We begin by deriving a specific dual of MMD-regularized UOT (MMD-UOT), which helps us prove several useful properties. One interesting outcome of this duality result is that MMD-UOT induces novel metrics, which not only lift the ground metric like the Wasserstein but are also sample-wise efficient to estimate like the MMD. Further, for real-world applications involving non-discrete measures, we present an estimator for the transport plan that is supported only on the given ($m$) samples. Under certain conditions, we prove that the estimation error with this finitely-supported transport plan is also $\\mathcal{O}(1/\\sqrt{m})$. As far as we know, such error bounds that are free from the curse of dimensionality are not known for $\\phi$-divergence regularized UOT. Finally, we discuss how the proposed estimator can be computed efficiently using accelerated gradient descent. Our experiments show that MMD-UOT consistently outperforms popular baselines, including KL-regularized UOT and MMD, in diverse machine learning applications",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "We study the corrupted bandit problem, i.e. a stochastic multi-armed bandit problem with $k$ unknown reward distributions, which are heavy-tailed and corrupted by a history-independent adversary or Nature. To be specific, the reward obtained by playing an arm comes from corresponding heavy-tailed reward distribution with probability $1-\\varepsilon \\in (0.5,1]$ and an arbitrary corruption distribution of unbounded support with probability $\\varepsilon \\in [0,0.5)$. First, we provide \\textit{a problem-dependent lower bound on the regret} of any corrupted bandit algorithm. The lower bounds indicate that the corrupted bandit problem is harder than the classical stochastic bandit problem with subGaussian or heavy-tail rewards. Following that, we propose a novel UCB-type algorithm for corrupted bandits, namely \\texttt{HubUCB}, that builds on Huber's estimator for robust mean estimation. Leveraging a novel concentration inequality of Huber's estimator, we prove that \\texttt{HubUCB} achieves a near-optimal regret upper bound. Since computing Huber's estimator has quadratic complexity, we further introduce a sequential version of Huber's estimator that exhibits linear complexity. We leverage this sequential estimator to design \\texttt{SeqHubUCB} that enjoys similar regret guarantees while reducing the computational burden. Finally, we experimentally illustrate the efficiency of \\texttt{HubUCB} and \\texttt{SeqHubUCB} in solving corrupted bandits for different reward distributions and different levels of corruptions",

    "abstract": "Bayesian Optimization (BO) is an effective method for finding the global optimum of expensive black-box functions. However, it is well known that applying BO to high-dimensional optimization problems is challenging. To address this issue, a promising solution is to use a local search strategy that partitions the search domain into local regions with high likelihood of containing the global optimum, and then use BO to optimize the objective function within these regions. In this paper, we propose a novel technique for defining the local regions using the Covariance Matrix Adaptation (CMA) strategy. Specifically, we use CMA to learn a search distribution that can estimate the probabilities of data points being the global optimum of the objective function. Based on this search distribution, we then define the local regions consisting of data points with high probabilities of being the global optimum. Our approach serves as a meta-algorithm as it can incorporate existing black-box BO optimizers, such as BO, TuRBO, and BAxUS, to find the global optimum of the objective function within our derived local regions. We evaluate our proposed method on various benchmark synthetic and real-world problems. The results demonstrate that our method outperforms existing state-of-the-art techniques",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "In variable selection, a selection rule that prescribes the permissible sets of selected variables (called a \"selection dictionary\") is desirable due to the inherent structural constraints among the candidate variables. Such selection rules can be complex in real-world data analyses, and failing to incorporate such restrictions could not only compromise the interpretability of the model but also lead to decreased prediction accuracy. However, no general framework has been proposed to formalize selection rules and their applications, which poses a significant challenge for practitioners seeking to integrate these rules into their analyses. In this work, we establish a framework for structured variable selection that can incorporate universal structural constraints. We develop a mathematical language for constructing arbitrary selection rules, where the selection dictionary is formally defined. We demonstrate that all selection rules can be expressed as combinations of operations on constructs, facilitating the identification of the corresponding selection dictionary. We use a detailed and complex example to illustrate the developed framework. Once this selection dictionary is derived, practitioners can apply their own user-defined criteria to select the optimal model. Additionally, our framework enhances existing penalized regression methods for variable selection by providing guidance on how to appropriately group variables to achieve the desired selection rule. Furthermore, our innovative framework opens the door to establishing new $\\ell_0$-based penalized regression techniques that can be tailored to respect arbitrary selection rules, thereby expanding the possibilities for more robust and tailored model development",

    "abstract": "Any representation of data involves arbitrary investigator choices. Because those choices are external to the data-generating process, each choice leads to an exact symmetry, corresponding to the group of transformations that takes one possible representation to another. These are the passive symmetries; they include coordinate freedom, gauge symmetry, and units covariance, all of which have led to important results in physics. In machine learning, the most visible passive symmetry is the relabeling or permutation symmetry of graphs. The active symmetries are those that must be established by observation and experiment. They include, for instance, translations invariances or rotation invariances of physical law. These symmetries are the subject of most of the equivariant machine learning literature. Our goal, in this conceptual contribution, is to understand the implications for machine learning of the many passive and active symmetries in play. We discuss dos and don'ts for machine learning practice if passive symmetries are to be respected. We discuss links to causal modeling and argue that the implementation of passive symmetries is particularly valuable when the goal of the learning problem is to generalize out of sample. We conjecture that the implementation of passive symmetries might help machine learning in the same ways that it transformed physics in the twentieth century",

Although transfer learning can be beneficial in many applications, it can transfer undesirable information to target tasks that may severely curtail its performance in the target domain or raise ethical concerns related to privacy and/or fairness. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for suppressing the transfer of user-determined semantic concepts (viz. color, glasses, etc.) in intermediate source representations to target tasks without retraining the source model which can otherwise be expensive or even infeasible. Notably, we tackle a bigger challenge in the input data as a given intermediate source representation is biased towards the source task, thus possibly further entangling the desired concepts. We evaluate our approach qualitatively and quantitatively in the visual domain showcasing its efficacy for classification and generative source models. Finally, we provide a concept selection approach that automatically suppresses the undesirable concepts",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Distributed data-parallel optimization accelerates the training of neural networks, but requires constant synchronization of gradients between the workers, which can become a bottleneck. One way to reduce communication overhead is to use Local SGD, where each worker asynchronously takes multiple local gradient steps, after which the model weights are averaged. In this work, we discuss the choice of learning rate for Local SGD, showing that it faces an intricate trade-off. Unlike in the synchronous case, its gradient estimate is biased, with the bias dependent on the learning rate itself. Thus using learning rate scaling techniques designed for faster convergence in the synchronous case with Local SGD results in a performance degradation as previously observed. To analyze the manifestation of this bias, we study convergence behaviour of Local SGD and synchronous data-parallel SGD when using their optimal learning rates. Our experiments show that the optimal learning rate for Local SGD differs substantially from that of SGD, and when using it the performance of Local SGD matches that of SGD. However, this performance comes at the cost of added training iterations, rendering Local SGD faster than SGD only when communication is much more time-consuming than computation. This suggests that Local SGD may be of limited practical utility",

However, standard econometric models cannot take advantage of their scale or incorporate them into the analysis of survey data. To this end we develop CAREER, a foundation model for job sequences. CAREER is first fit to large, passively-collected resume data and then fine-tuned to smaller, better-curated datasets for economic inferences. We fit CAREER to a dataset of 24 million job sequences from resumes, and adjust it on small longitudinal survey datasets. We find that CAREER forms accurate predictions of job sequences, outperforming econometric baselines on three widely-used economics datasets.

However, existing works only consider preserving the semantics of the graph but ignore the inter-cluster separability of the nodes, so there's no guarantee that the embeddings can present a clear clustering structure. To remedy this deficiency, we propose Hyperspherical Prototype Node Clustering (HPNC), an end-to-end clustering paradigm that explicitly enhances the inter-cluster separability of learned node embeddings. Concretely, we constrain the embedding space to a unit-hypersphere, enabling us to scatter the cluster prototypes over the space with maximized pairwise distances. Then, we employ a graph autoencoder to map nodes onto the same hypersphere manifold. Consequently, cluster affinities can be directly retrieved from cosine similarities between node embeddings and prototypes. A clustering-oriented loss is imposed to sharpen the affinity distribution so that the learned node embeddings are encouraged to have small intra-cluster distances and large inter-cluster distances. Based on the proposed HPNC paradigm, we devise two schemes (HPNC-IM and HPNC-DEC) with distinct clustering backbones. Empirical results on popular benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of our method compared to other state-of-the-art clustering methods, and visualization results illustrate improved separability of the learned embeddings",

Both are limitations in high dimension and when we do not have any prior knowledge on the form of the target distribution, such as its number of modes. Variational autoencoders are probabilistic tools able to represent with fidelity high-dimensional data in a lower dimensional space. They constitute a parametric family of distributions robust faced to the dimension and since they are based on deep neural networks, they are flexible enough to be considered as non-parametric models.

    "title": "Separability Analysis for Causal Discovery in Mixture of DAGs",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) are effective for compactly representing causal systems and specifying the causal relationships among the system's constituents. Specifying such causal relationships in some systems requires a mixture of multiple DAGs -- a single DAG is insufficient. Some examples include time-varying causal systems or aggregated subgroups of a population. Recovering the causal structure of the systems represented by single DAGs is investigated extensively, but it remains mainly open for the systems represented by a mixture of DAGs. A major difference between single- versus mixture-DAG recovery is the existence of node pairs that are separable in the individual DAGs but become inseparable in their mixture. This paper provides the theoretical foundations for analyzing such inseparable node pairs. Specifically, the notion of \\emph{emergent edges} is introduced to represent such inseparable pairs that do not exist in the single DAGs but emerge in their mixtures. Necessary conditions for identifying the emergent edges are established. Operationally, these conditions serve as sufficient conditions for separating a pair of nodes in the mixture of DAGs. These results are further extended, and matching necessary and sufficient conditions for identifying the emergent edges in tree-structured DAGs are established. Finally, a novel graphical representation is formalized to specify these conditions, and an algorithm is provided for inferring the learnable causal relations",

    "title": "Unleashing the Potential of Acquisition Functions in High-Dimensional Bayesian Optimization",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Bayesian optimization (BO) is widely used to optimize expensive-to-evaluate black-box functions. It first builds a surrogate for the objective and quantifies its uncertainty. It then decides where to sample by maximizing an acquisition function (AF) defined by the surrogate model. However, when dealing with high-dimensional problems, finding the global maximum of the AF becomes increasingly challenging. In such cases, the manner in which the AF maximizer is initialized plays a pivotal role. An inappropriate initialization can severely limit the potential of AF. This paper investigates a largely understudied problem concerning the impact of AF maximizer initialization on exploiting AFs' capability. Our large-scale empirical study shows that the widely used random initialization strategy may fail to harness the potential of an AF. Based on this observation, we propose a better initialization approach by employing multiple heuristic optimizers to leverage the historical data of black-box optimization to generate initial points for an AF maximizer. We evaluate our approach with a variety of heavily studied synthetic test functions and real-world applications. Experimental results show that our techniques, while simple, can significantly enhance the standard BO and outperform state-of-the-art methods by a large margin in most test cases",

    "title": "On the Adversarial Robustness of Camera-based 3D Object Detection",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "In recent years, camera-based 3D object detection has gained widespread attention for its ability to achieve high performance with low computational cost. However, the robustness of these methods to adversarial attacks has not been thoroughly examined, especially when considering their deployment in safety-critical domains like autonomous driving. In this study, we conduct the first comprehensive investigation of the robustness of leading camera-based 3D object detection approaches under various adversarial conditions. We systematically analyze the resilience of these models under two attack settings: white-box and black-box; focusing on two primary objectives: classification and localization. Additionally, we delve into two types of adversarial attack techniques: pixel-based and patch-based. Our experiments yield four interesting findings: (a) bird's-eye-view-based representations exhibit stronger robustness against localization attacks; (b) depth-estimation-free approaches have the potential to show stronger robustness; (c) accurate depth estimation effectively improves robustness for depth-estimation-based methods; (d) incorporating multi-frame benign inputs can effectively mitigate adversarial attacks. We hope our findings can steer the development of future camera-based object detection models with enhanced adversarial robustness.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Generative models have gained popularity for their potential applications in imaging science, such as image reconstruction, posterior sampling and data sharing. Flow-based generative models are particularly attractive due to their ability to tractably provide exact density estimates along with fast, inexpensive and diverse samples. Training such models, however, requires a large, high quality dataset of objects. In applications such as computed imaging, it is often difficult to acquire such data due to requirements such as long acquisition time or high radiation dose, while acquiring noisy or partially observed measurements of these objects is more feasible. In this work, we propose AmbientFlow, a framework for learning flow-based generative models directly from noisy and incomplete data. Using variational Bayesian methods, a novel framework for establishing flow-based generative models from noisy, incomplete data is proposed. Extensive numerical studies demonstrate the effectiveness of AmbientFlow in learning the object distribution. The utility of AmbientFlow in a downstream inference task of image reconstruction is demonstrated",

    "abstract": "Learning control from pixels is difficult for reinforcement learning (RL) agents because representation learning and policy learning are intertwined. Previous approaches remedy this issue with auxiliary representation learning tasks, but they either do not consider the temporal aspect of the problem or only consider single-step transitions, which may cause learning inefficiencies if important environmental changes take many steps to manifest. We propose Hierarchical $k$-Step Latent (HKSL), an auxiliary task that learns multiple representations via a hierarchy of forward models that learn to communicate and an ensemble of $n$-step critics that all operate at varying magnitudes of step skipping. We evaluate HKSL in a suite of 30 robotic control tasks with and without distractors and a task of our creation. We find that HKSL either converges to higher or optimal episodic returns more quickly than several alternative representation learning approaches. Furthermore, we find that HKSL's representations capture task-relevant details accurately across timescales (even in the presence of distractors) and that communication channels between hierarchy levels organize information based on both sides of the communication process, both of which improve sample efficiency",

    "title": "Federated Classification in Hyperbolic Spaces via Secure Aggregation of Convex Hulls",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Hierarchical and tree-like data sets arise in many relevant applications, including language processing, graph data mining, phylogeny and genomics. It is known that tree-like data cannot be embedded into Euclidean spaces of finite dimension with small distortion, and that this problem can be mitigated through the use of hyperbolic spaces. When such data also has to be processed in a distributed and privatized setting, it becomes necessary to work with new federated learning methods tailored to hyperbolic spaces. As an initial step towards the development of the field of federated learning in hyperbolic spaces, we propose the first known approach to federated classification in hyperbolic spaces. Our contributions are as follows. First, we develop distributed versions of convex SVM classifiers for Poincar\\'e discs. In this setting, the information conveyed from clients to the global classifier are convex hulls of clusters present in individual client data. Second, to avoid label switching issues, we introduce a number-theoretic approach for label recovery based on the so-called integer $B_h$ sequences. Third, we compute the complexity of the convex hulls in hyperbolic spaces to assess the extent of data leakage; at the same time, in order to limit the communication cost for the hulls, we propose a new quantization method for the Poincar\\'e disc coupled with Reed-Solomon-like encoding. Fourth, at the server level, we introduce a new approach for aggregating convex hulls of the clients based on balanced graph partitioning. We test our method on a collection of diverse data sets, including hierarchical single-cell RNA-seq data from different patients distributed across different repositories that have stringent privacy constraints. The classification accuracy of our method is up to $\\sim11\\%$ better than its Euclidean counterpart, demonstrating the importance of privacy-preserving learning in hyperbolic spaces.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Algorithmic Recourse (AR) is the problem of computing a sequence of actions that -- once performed by a user -- overturns an undesirable machine decision. It is paramount that the sequence of actions does not require too much effort for users to implement. Yet, most approaches to AR assume that actions cost the same for all users, and thus may recommend unfairly expensive recourse plans to certain users. Prompted by this observation, we introduce PEAR, the first human-in-the-loop approach capable of providing personalized algorithmic recourse tailored to the needs of any end-user. PEAR builds on insights from Bayesian Preference Elicitation to iteratively refine an estimate of the costs of actions by asking choice set queries to the target user. The queries themselves are computed by maximizing the Expected Utility of Selection, a principled measure of information gain accounting for uncertainty on both the cost estimate and the user's responses. PEAR integrates elicitation into a Reinforcement Learning agent coupled with Monte Carlo Tree Search to quickly identify promising recourse plans. Our empirical evaluation on real-world datasets highlights how PEAR produces high-quality personalized recourse in only a handful of iterations",

    "title": "A Fully Decentralized Surrogate for Multi-Agent Policy Optimization",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "The study of fully decentralized learning or independent learning in cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning has a history of decades. Recent empirical studies have shown that independent PPO (IPPO) can achieve good performance, comparable to or even better than the methods of centralized training with decentralized execution, in several benchmarks. However, a decentralized actor-critic algorithm with a convergence guarantee is still an open problem. In this paper, we propose decentralized policy optimization (DPO), a decentralized actor-critic algorithm with monotonic improvement and convergence guarantee. We derive a novel decentralized surrogate for policy optimization such that the monotonic improvement of joint policy can be guaranteed by each agent independently optimizing the surrogate. For practical implementation, this decentralized surrogate can be realized by two adaptive coefficients for policy optimization at each agent. Empirically, we evaluate DPO, IPPO, and independent Q-learning (IQL) in a variety of cooperative multi-agent tasks, covering discrete and continuous action spaces, as well as fully and partially observable environments. The results show DPO outperforms both IPPO and IQL in most tasks, which serves as evidence for our theoretical results. The code is available at https://github.com/PKU-RL/DPO",

    "abstract": "This paper presents an online learning mechanism to address the challenge of state tracking for unknown linear systems under general adversarial disturbances. The reference trajectory is assumed to be generated by unknown exosystem dynamics, which relaxes the common assumption of known dynamics for exosystems. Learning a tracking control policy for unknown systems with unknown exosystem dynamics under general disturbances is challenging and surprisingly unsettled. To face this challenge, the presented online learning algorithm has two stages: In the first stage, an algorithm identifies the dynamics of the uncertain system, and in the second stage, an online parametrized memory-augmented controller accounts for the identification error, unknown exosystem dynamics as well as disturbances. The controller's parameters are learned to optimize a general convex cost function, and learning the control parameters is formulated as an online convex optimization problem. This approach uses the memory of previous disturbances and reference values to capture their effects on performance over time. Besides, it implicitly learns the dynamics of the exosystems. The algorithm enables online tuning of controller parameters to achieve state tracking and disturbance rejection while minimizing general convex costs. It is shown that the algorithm achieves a policy regret of $\\mathcal{O}({T}^{\\frac{2}{3}})$. In the simulation results, the performance of the presented tracking algorithm was compared with the certainty equivalent $H_{\\infty}$-control and linear quadratic regulator",

We revisit existing approaches and combine different techniques to scale our pretraining in terms of data and model size. Most of the technical contributions aim at accelerating and stabilizing the training at scale. In terms of data, we propose an automatic pipeline to build a dedicated, diverse, and curated image dataset instead of uncurated data, as typically done in the self-supervised literature.

    "title": "Boomerang: Local sampling on image manifolds using diffusion models",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "The inference stage of diffusion models can be seen as running a reverse-time diffusion stochastic differential equation, where samples from a Gaussian latent distribution are transformed into samples from a target distribution that usually reside on a low-dimensional manifold, e.g., an image manifold. The intermediate values between the initial latent space and the image manifold can be interpreted as noisy images, with the amount of noise determined by the forward diffusion process noise schedule. We utilize this interpretation to present Boomerang, an approach for local sampling of image manifolds exploiting the reverse diffusion process dynamics. As implied by its name, Boomerang local sampling involves adding noise to an input image, moving it closer to the latent space, and then mapping it back to the image manifold through a partial reverse diffusion process. Thus, Boomerang generates images on the manifold that are ``similar,'' but nonidentical, to the original input image. We can control the proximity of the generated images to the original by adjusting the amount of noise added. Furthermore, due to the stochastic nature of the partial reverse diffusion process in Boomerang, the generated images display a certain degree of stochasticity, allowing us to obtain ample local samples from the manifold without encountering any duplicates. Boomerang offers the flexibility to work seamlessly with any pretrained diffusion model, such as Stable Diffusion, without necessitating any adjustments to the reverse diffusion process. We present three applications for local sampling using Boomerang. First, we provide a framework for constructing privacy-preserving datasets having controllable degrees of anonymity. Second, we show that using Boomerang for data augmentation increases generalization performance and outperforms state-of-the-art synthetic data augmentation. Lastly, we introduce a perceptual image enhancement framework powered by Boomerang, which enables resolution enhancement",

The current combination of linear algebra notation and ad-hoc diagrams fails to offer the necessary precision to understand architectures in all their detail. However, this detail is critical for faithful implementation, mathematical analysis, further innovation, and ethical assurances. I present neural circuit diagrams, a graphical language tailored to the needs of communicating deep learning architectures. Neural circuit diagrams naturally keep track of the changing arrangement of data, precisely show how operations are broadcast over axes, and display the critical parallel behavior of linear operations. A lingering issue with existing diagramming methods is the inability to simultaneously express the detail of axes and the free arrangement of data, which neural circuit diagrams solve. Their compositional structure is analogous to code, creating a close correspondence between diagrams and implementation. In this work, I introduce neural circuit diagrams for an audience of machine learning researchers. After introducing neural circuit diagrams, I cover a host of architectures to show their utility and breed familiarity. This includes the transformer architecture, convolution (and its difficult-to-explain extensions), residual networks, the U-Net, and the vision transformer. I include a Jupyter notebook that provides evidence for the close correspondence between diagrams and code. Finally, I examine backpropagation using neural circuit diagrams.

We then categorize recent algorithms into three classes according to the data they used: (1) OOD data available, (2) OOD data unavailable + in-distribution (ID) label available, and (3) OOD data unavailable + ID label unavailable.

    "abstract": "We propose a custom learning algorithm for shallow over-parameterized neural networks, i.e., networks with single hidden layer having infinite width. The infinite width of the hidden layer serves as an abstraction for the over-parameterization. Building on the recent mean field interpretations of learning dynamics in shallow neural networks, we realize mean field learning as a computational algorithm, rather than as an analytical tool. Specifically, we design a Sinkhorn regularized proximal algorithm to approximate the distributional flow for the learning dynamics over weighted point clouds. In this setting, a contractive fixed point recursion computes the time-varying weights, numerically realizing the interacting Wasserstein gradient flow of the parameter distribution supported over the neuronal ensemble. An appealing aspect of the proposed algorithm is that the measure-valued recursions allow meshless computation. We demonstrate the proposed computational framework of interacting weighted particle evolution on binary and multi-class classification. Our algorithm performs gradient descent of the free energy associated with the risk functional",

Our method is designed so as to optimize the energy consumption metric directly without modifying the network architecture. Therefore, the proposed method can reduce the energy consumption more than other methods while maintaining the accuracy.

    "abstract": "Instruction tuning has emerged as a promising approach to enhancing large language models in following human instructions. It is shown that increasing the diversity and number of instructions in the training data can consistently enhance generalization performance, which facilitates a recent endeavor to collect various instructions and integrate existing instruction tuning datasets into larger collections. However, different users have their unique ways of expressing instructions, and there often exist variations across different datasets in the instruction styles and formats, i.e., format inconsistency. In this work, a framework named Unified Instruction Tuning (UIT) is proposed, which calls OpenAI APIs for automatic format transfer among different instruction tuning datasets such as PromptSource, FLAN and CrossFit. With the framework, we (1) demonstrate the necessity of maintaining format consistency in instruction tuning; (2) improve the generalization performance on unseen instructions on T5-LM-xl; (3) provide a novel perplexity-based denoising method to reduce the noise of automatic format transfer to make the UIT framework more practical and a smaller offline model based on GPT-J that achieves comparable format transfer capability to OpenAI APIs to reduce costs in practice. Further analysis regarding variations of targeted formats and other effects is intended. The code and trained models will soon be available",

We derive a variational objective to train the model, analogous to the evidence lower bound (ELBO) used to train variational auto-encoders, that generalises the cross-entropy loss used to train classification models. Treating inputs to the softmax layer as samples of a latent variable, our abstracted perspective reveals a potential inconsistency between their anticipated distribution, required for accurate label predictions to be output, and the empirical distribution found in practice. We augment the variational objective to mitigate such inconsistency and encourage a chosen latent distribution, instead of the implicit assumption in off-the-shelf softmax classifiers. Overall, we provide new theoretical insight into the inner workings of widely-used softmax classification. Empirical evaluation on image and text classification datasets demonstrates that our proposed approach, variational classification, maintains classification accuracy while the reshaped latent space improves other desirable properties of a classifier, such as calibration, adversarial robustness, robustness to distribution shift and sample efficiency useful in low data settings",

    "volume": "featured",
    "abstract": "The causal capabilities of large language models (LLMs) are a matter of significant debate, with critical implications for the use of LLMs in societally impactful domains such as medicine, science, law, and policy. We conduct a \"behavorial\" study of LLMs to benchmark their capability in generating causal arguments. Across a wide range of tasks, we find that LLMs can generate text corresponding to correct causal arguments with high probability, surpassing the best-performing existing methods. Algorithms based on GPT-3.5 and 4 outperform existing algorithms on a pairwise causal discovery task (97%, 13 points gain), counterfactual reasoning task (92%, 20 points gain) and event causality (86% accuracy in determining necessary and sufficient causes in vignettes). We perform robustness checks across tasks and show that the capabilities cannot be explained by dataset memorization alone, especially since LLMs generalize to novel datasets that were created after the training cutoff date. That said, LLMs exhibit unpredictable failure modes and we discuss the kinds of errors that may be improved and what are the fundamental limits of LLM-based answers. Overall, by operating on the text metadata, LLMs bring capabilities so far understood to be restricted to humans, such as using collected knowledge to generate causal graphs or identifying background causal context from natural language. As a result, LLMs may be used by human domain experts to save effort in setting up a causal analysis, one of the biggest impediments to the widespread adoption of causal methods. Given that LLMs ignore the actual data, our results also point to a fruitful research direction of developing algorithms that combine LLMs with existing causal techniques.

Our results show that, in the standard low-rank settings, LoRA substantially underperforms full finetuning.

    "volume": "featured",
    "abstract": "Animals and robots navigate through environments by building and refining maps of space. These maps enable functions including navigation back to home, planning, search and foraging. Here, we use observations from neuroscience, specifically the observed fragmentation of grid cell map in compartmentalized spaces, to propose and apply the concept of Fragmentation-and-Recall (FARMap) in the mapping of large spaces. Agents solve the mapping problem by building local maps via a surprisal-based clustering of space, which they use to set subgoals for spatial exploration. Agents build and use a local map to predict their observations; high surprisal leads to a \"fragmentation event\" that truncates the local map. At these events, the recent local map is placed into long-term memory (LTM) and a different local map is initialized. If observations at a fracture point match observations in one of the stored local maps, that map is recalled (and thus reused) from LTM. The fragmentation points induce a natural online clustering of the larger space, forming a set of intrinsic potential subgoals that are stored in LTM as a topological graph. Agents choose their next subgoal from the set of near and far potential subgoals from within the current local map or LTM, respectively. Thus, local maps guide exploration locally, while LTM promotes global exploration. We demonstrate that FARMap replicates the fragmentation points observed in animal studies. We evaluate FARMap on complex procedurally-generated spatial environments and realistic simulations to demonstrate that this mapping strategy much more rapidly covers the environment (number of agent steps and wall clock time) and is more efficient in active memory usage, without loss of performance",

    "abstract": "Pre-trained foundation models, due to their enormous capacity and exposure to vast amounts of data during pre-training, are known to have learned plenty of real-world concepts. An important step in making these pre-trained models effective on downstream tasks is to fine-tune them on related datasets. While various fine-tuning methods have been devised and have been shown to be highly effective, we observe that a fine-tuned model's ability to recognize concepts on tasks different from the downstream one is reduced significantly compared to its pre-trained counterpart. This is an undesirable effect of fine-tuning as a substantial amount of resources was used to learn these pre-trained concepts in the first place. We call this phenomenon \"concept forgetting'' and via experiments show that most end-to-end fine-tuning approaches suffer heavily from this side effect. To this end, we propose a simple fix to this problem by designing a new fine-tuning method called LDIFS (short for $\\ell_2$ distance in feature space) that, while learning new concepts related to the downstream task, allows a model to preserve its pre-trained knowledge as well. Through extensive experiments on 10 fine-tuning tasks we show that LDIFS significantly reduces concept forgetting. Additionally, we show that LDIFS is highly effective in performing continual fine-tuning on a sequence of tasks as well, in comparison with both fine-tuning as well as continual learning baselines",

    "abstract": "Human ability to recognize complex visual patterns arises through transformations performed by successive areas in the ventral visual cortex. Deep neural networks trained endto-end for object recognition approach human capabilities, and offer the best descriptions to date of neural responses in the late stages of the hierarchy. But these networks provide a poor account of the early stages, compared to traditional hand-engineered models, or models optimized for coding efficiency or prediction. Moreover, the gradient backpropagation used in end-to-end learning is generally considered to be biologically implausible. Here, we overcome both of these limitations by developing a bottom-up self-supervised training methodology that operates independently on successive layers. Specifically, we maximize feature similarity between pairs of locally-deformed natural image patches, while decorrelating features across patches sampled from other images. Crucially, the deformation amplitudes are adjusted proportionally to receptive field sizes in each layer, thus matching the task complexity to the capacity at each stage of processing. In comparison with architecturematched versions of previous models, we demonstrate that our layerwise complexity-matched learning (LCL) formulation produces a two-stage model (LCL-V2) that is better aligned with selectivity properties and neural activity in primate area V2. We demonstrate that the complexity-matched learning paradigm is responsible for much of the emergence of the improved biological alignment. Finally, when the two-stage model is used as a fixed front end for a deep network trained to perform object recognition, the resultant model (LCL-V2Net) is significantly better than standard end-to-end self-supervised, supervised, and adversarially-trained models in terms of generalization to out-of-distribution tasks and alignment with human behavior.

The phenomenon was first described when jointly optimizing the graph and the parameters of a shallow Graph Neural Network (GNN) using a single loss function. In this work, we give a precise mathematical characterization of this phenomenon, and prove that it also emerges in bilevel optimization. While for GNNs gradient scarcity occurs due to their finite receptive field, we show that it also occurs with the Laplacian regularization as gradients decrease exponentially in amplitude with distance to labeled nodes, despite the infinite receptive field of this model. We study several solutions to this issue including latent graph learning using a Graph-to-Graph model (G2G), graph regularization to impose a prior structure on the graph, and reducing the graph diameter by optimizing for a larger set of edges.

To achieve progressively improving solutions with minimal sampling, we introduce a method that combines round-wise Stochastic Beam Search with an update strategy derived from a provable policy improvement. This strategy refines the policy between rounds by utilizing the advantage of the sampled sequences with almost no computational overhead. We evaluate our approach on the Traveling Salesman Problem and the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem.

Our model, which recovers stationary linear bandits as a special case, leverages two parameters: the window size $m \\ge 0$, and an exponent $\\gamma$ that captures the rotting ($\\gamma < 0)$ or rising ($\\gamma > 0$) nature of the phenomenon. When both $m$ and $\\gamma$ are known, we propose and analyze a variant of OFUL which minimizes regret against cyclic policies.

    "abstract": "Modern deep learning models have the ability to generate high-dimensional vectors whose similarity reflects semantic resemblance. Thus, similarity search, i.e., the operation of retrieving those vectors in a large collection that are similar to a given query, has become a critical component of a wide range of applications that demand highly accurate and timely answers. In this setting, the high vector dimensionality puts similarity search systems under compute and memory pressure, leading to subpar performance. Additionally, cross-modal retrieval tasks have become increasingly common, e.g., where a user inputs a text query to find the most relevant images for that query. However, these queries often have different distributions than the database embeddings, making it challenging to achieve high accuracy. In this work, we present LeanVec, a framework that combines linear dimensionality reduction with vector quantization to accelerate similarity search on high-dimensional vectors while maintaining accuracy. We present LeanVec variants for in-distribution (ID) and out-of-distribution (OOD) queries. LeanVec-ID yields accuracies on par with those from recently introduced deep learning alternatives whose computational overhead precludes their usage in practice. LeanVec-OOD uses a novel technique for dimensionality reduction that considers the query and database distributions to simultaneously boost the accuracy and the performance of the framework even further (even presenting competitive results when the query and database distributions match). All in all, our extensive and varied experimental results show that LeanVec produces state-of-the-art results, with up to 3.7x improvement in search throughput and up to 4.9x faster index build time over the state of the art",

To address this issue, we introduce $\\textbf{S}$oft $\\textbf{M}$erging of $\\textbf{E}$xperts with $\\textbf{A}$daptive $\\textbf{R}$outing (SMEAR), which avoids discrete routing by using a single \"merged\" expert constructed via a weighted average of all of the experts' parameters. By routing activations through a single merged expert, SMEAR does not incur a significant increase in computational costs and enables standard gradient-based training. We empirically validate that models using SMEAR outperform models that route based on metadata or learn routing through gradient estimation. Furthermore, we provide qualitative analysis demonstrating that the experts learned via SMEAR exhibit a significant amount of specialization",

    "title": "Deep Generalized Prediction Set Classifier and Its Theoretical Guarantees",
    "volume": "featured",
    "abstract": "A standard classification rule returns a single-valued prediction for any observation without a confidence guarantee, which may result in severe consequences in many critical applications when the uncertainty is high. In contrast, set-valued classification is a new paradigm to handle the uncertainty in classification by reporting a set of plausible labels to observations in highly ambiguous regions. In this article, we propose the Deep Generalized Prediction Set (DeepGPS) method, a network-based set-valued classifier induced by acceptance region learning. DeepGPS is capable of identifying ambiguous observations and detecting out-of-distribution (OOD) observations. It is the first set-valued classification of this kind with a theoretical guarantee and scalable to large datasets. Our nontrivial proof shows that the risk of DeepGPS, defined as the expected size of the prediction set, attains the optimality within a neural network hypothesis class while simultaneously achieving the user-prescribed class-specific accuracy. Additionally, by using a weighted loss, DeepGPS returns tighter acceptance regions, leading to informative predictions and improved OOD detection performance. Empirically, our method outperforms the baselines on several benchmark datasets",

    "title": "As large as it gets – Studying Infinitely Large Convolutions via Neural Implicit Frequency Filters",
    "volume": "featured",
    "abstract": "Recent work in neural networks for image classification has seen a strong tendency towards increasing the spatial context during encoding. Whether achieved through large convolution kernels or self-attention, models scale poorly with the increased spatial context, such that the improved model accuracy often comes at significant costs. In this paper, we propose a module for studying the effective filter size of convolutional neural networks (CNNs). To facilitate such a study, several challenges need to be addressed: (i) we need an effective means to train models with large filters (potentially as large as the input data) without increasing the number of learnable parameters, (ii) the employed convolution operation should be a plug-and-play module that can replace conventional convolutions in a CNN and allow for an efficient implementation in current frameworks, (iii) the study of filter sizes has to be decoupled from other aspects such as the network width or the number of learnable parameters, and (iv) the cost of the convolution operation itself has to remain manageable i.e.~we can not naïvely increase the size of the convolution kernel. To address these challenges, we propose to learn the frequency representations of filter weights as neural implicit functions, such that the better scalability of the convolution in the frequency domain can be leveraged. Additionally, due to the implementation of the proposed neural implicit function, even large and expressive spatial filters can be parameterized by only a few learnable weights. Interestingly, our analysis shows that, although the proposed networks could learn very large convolution kernels, the learned filters are well localized and relatively small in practice when transformed from the frequency to the spatial domain. We anticipate that our analysis of individually optimized filter sizes will allow for more efficient, yet effective, models in the future. Our code is available at https://github.com/GeJulia/NIFF",

    "title": "What Has Been Overlooked in Contrastive Source-Free Domain Adaptation: Leveraging Source-Informed Latent Augmentation within Neighborhood Context",
    "volume": "featured",
    "abstract": "Source-free domain adaptation (SFDA) involves adapting a model originally trained using a labeled dataset (source domain) to perform effectively on an unlabeled dataset (target domain) without relying on any source data during adaptation. This adaptation is especially crucial when significant disparities in data distributions exist between the two domains and when there are privacy concerns regarding the source model's training data. The absence of access to source data during adaptation makes it challenging to analytically estimate the domain gap. To tackle this issue, various techniques have been proposed, such as unsupervised clustering, contrastive learning, and continual learning. In this paper, we first conduct an extensive theoretical analysis of SFDA based on contrastive learning, primarily because it has demonstrated superior performance compared to other techniques. Motivated by the obtained insights, we then introduce a straightforward yet highly effective latent augmentation method tailored for contrastive SFDA. This augmentation method leverages the dispersion of latent features within the neighborhood of the query sample, guided by the source pre-trained model, to enhance the informativeness of positive keys. Our approach, based on a single InfoNCE-based contrastive loss, outperforms state-of-the-art SFDA methods on widely recognized benchmark datasets",

    "abstract": "Recent advancements in text-to-image diffusion models have yielded impressive results in generating realistic and diverse images. However, these models still struggle with complex prompts, such as those that involve numeracy and spatial reasoning. This work proposes to enhance prompt understanding capabilities in diffusion models. Our method leverages a pretrained large language model (LLM) for grounded generation in a novel two-stage process. In the first stage, the LLM generates a scene layout that comprises captioned bounding boxes from a given prompt describing the desired image. In the second stage, a novel controller guides an off-the-shelf diffusion model for layout-grounded image generation. Both stages utilize existing pretrained models without additional model parameter optimization. Our method significantly outperforms the base diffusion model and several strong baselines in accurately generating images according to prompts that require various capabilities, doubling the generation accuracy across four tasks on average. Furthermore, our method enables instruction-based multi-round scene specification and can handle prompts in languages not supported by the underlying diffusion model. We anticipate that our method will unleash users' creativity by accurately following more complex prompts. Our code, demo, and benchmark are available at: https://llm-grounded-diffusion.github.io",

Our method, modular low-rank adaptation (ModuLoRA), integrates any user-specified weight quantizer with finetuning via low-rank adapters (LoRAs). Our approach relies on a simple quantization-agnostic backward pass that adaptively materializes low-precision LLM weights from a custom black-box quantization module. This approach enables finetuning 2-bit and 3-bit LLMs for the first time---leveraging state-of-the-art 2-bit QuIP# quantization and 3-bit OPTQ quantization---outperforming finetuning that relies on less sophisticated 4-bit and 8-bit methods. In our experiments, ModuLoRA attains competitive performance on text classification, natural language infernece, and instruction following tasks using significantly less memory than existing approaches, and we also surpass the state-of-the-art ROUGE score on a popular summarization task.

    "volume": "featured",
    "abstract": "Off-policy evaluation and learning are concerned with assessing a given policy and learning an optimal policy from offline data without direct interaction with the environment. Often, the environment in which the data are collected differs from the environment in which the learned policy is applied. To account for the effect of different environments during learning and execution, distributionally robust optimization (DRO) methods have been developed that compute worst-case bounds on the policy values assuming that the distribution of the new environment lies within an uncertainty set. Typically, this uncertainty set is defined based on the KL divergence around the empirical distribution computed from the logging dataset. However, the KL uncertainty set fails to encompass distributions with varying support and lacks awareness of the geometry of the distribution support. As a result, KL approaches fall short in addressing practical environment mismatches and lead to over-fitting to worst-case scenarios. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel DRO approach that employs the Wasserstein distance instead. While Wasserstein DRO is generally computationally more expensive compared to KL DRO, we present a regularized method and a practical (biased) stochastic gradient descent method to optimize the policy efficiently. We also provide a theoretical analysis of the finite sample complexity and iteration complexity for our proposed method. We further validate our approach using a public dataset that was recorded in a randomized stoke trial",

    "title": "Pathologies of Predictive Diversity in Deep Ensembles",
    "volume": "featured",
    "abstract": "Classic results establish that encouraging predictive diversity improves performance in ensembles of low-capacity models, e.g. through bagging or boosting. Here we demonstrate that these intuitions do not apply to high-capacity neural network ensembles (deep ensembles), and in fact the opposite is often true. In a large scale study of nearly 600 neural network classification ensembles, we examine a variety of interventions that trade off component model performance for predictive diversity. While such interventions can improve the performance of small neural network ensembles (in line with standard intuitions), they harm the performance of the large neural network ensembles most often used in practice. Surprisingly, we also find that discouraging predictive diversity is often benign in large-network ensembles, fully inverting standard intuitions. Even when diversity-promoting interventions do not sacrifice component model performance (e.g. using heterogeneous architectures and training paradigms), we observe an opportunity cost associated with pursuing increased predictive diversity. Examining over 1000 ensembles, we observe that the performance benefits of diverse architectures/training procedures are easily dwarfed by the benefits of simply using higher-capacity models, despite the fact that such higher capacity models often yield significantly less predictive diversity. Overall, our findings demonstrate that standard intuitions around predictive diversity, originally developed for low-capacity ensembles, do not directly apply to modern high-capacity deep ensembles. This work clarifies fundamental challenges to the goal of improving deep ensembles by making them more diverse, while suggesting an alternative path: simply forming ensembles from ever more powerful (and less diverse) component models",

    "abstract": "The unprecedented photorealistic results achieved by recent text-to-image generative systems and their increasing use as plug-and-play content creation solutions make it crucial to understand their potential biases. In this work, we introduce three indicators to evaluate the realism, diversity and prompt-generation consistency of text-to-image generative systems when prompted to generate objects from across the world. Our indicators complement qualitative analysis of the broader impact of such systems by enabling automatic and efficient benchmarking of geographic disparities, an important step towards building responsible visual content creation systems. We use our proposed indicators to analyze potential geographic biases in state-of-the-art visual content creation systems and find that: (1) models have less realism and diversity of generations when prompting for Africa and West Asia than Europe, (2) prompting with geographic information comes at a cost to prompt-consistency and diversity of generated images, and (3) models exhibit more region-level disparities for some objects than others. Perhaps most interestingly, our indicators suggest that progress in image generation quality has come at the cost of real-world geographic representation. Our comprehensive evaluation constitutes a crucial step towards ensuring a positive experience of visual content creation for everyone.

    "volume": "reprod",
    "abstract": "Protecting privacy during inference with deep neural networks is possible by adding Gaussian noise to the activations in the last layers prior to the final classifiers or other task-specific layers. The activations in such layers are known as \"features\" (or, less commonly, as \"embeddings\" or \"feature embeddings\"). The added noise helps prevent reconstruction of the inputs from the noisy features. Lower bounding the variance of every possible unbiased estimator of the inputs quantifies the confidentiality arising from such added noise. Convenient, computationally tractable bounds are available from classic inequalities of Hammersley and of Chapman and Robbins -- the HCR bounds. Numerical experiments indicate that the HCR bounds are on the precipice of being effectual for small neural nets with the data sets, \"MNIST\" and \"CIFAR-10,\" which contain 10 classes each for image classification. The HCR bounds appear to be insufficient on their own to guarantee confidentiality of the inputs to inference with standard deep neural nets, \"ResNet-18\" and \"Swin-T,\" pre-trained on the data set, \"ImageNet-1000,\" which contains 1000 classes. Supplementing the addition of Gaussian noise to features with other methods for providing confidentiality may be warranted in the case of ImageNet. In all cases, the results reported here limit consideration to amounts of added noise that incur little degradation in the accuracy of classification from the noisy features. Thus, the added noise enhances confidentiality without much reduction in the accuracy on the task of image classification",

    "abstract": "Neural networks often struggle with high-dimensional but small sample-size tabular datasets. One reason is that current weight initialisation methods assume independence between weights, which can be problematic when there are insufficient samples to estimate the model's parameters accurately. In such small data scenarios, leveraging additional structures can improve the model's performance and training stability. To address this, we propose GCondNet, a general approach to enhance neural networks by leveraging implicit structures present in tabular data. We create a graph between samples for each data dimension, and utilise Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to extract this implicit structure, and for conditioning the parameters of the first layer of an underlying predictor network. By creating many small graphs, GCondNet exploits the data's high-dimensionality, and thus improves the performance of an underlying predictor network. We demonstrate GCondNet's effectiveness on 12 real-world datasets, where it outperforms 14 standard and state-of-the-art methods. The results show that GCondNet is a versatile framework for injecting graph-regularisation into various types of neural networks, including MLPs and tabular Transformers.

Within a single family of proprietary models, they find that LLMs exhibit a scaling-then-inverse-scaling relationship between model size and their measure of faithfulness, and that a 13 billion parameter model exhibits increased faithfulness compared to models ranging from 810 million to 175 billion parameters in size. We evaluate whether these results generalize as a property of all LLMs. We replicate the experimental setup in their section focused on scaling experiments with three different families of models and, under specific conditions, successfully reproduce the scaling trends for CoT faithfulness they report. However, after normalizing the metric to account for a model's bias toward certain answer choices, unfaithfulness drops significantly for smaller less-capable models.

    "abstract": "The growing reproducibility crisis in machine learning has brought forward a need for careful examination of research findings. This paper investigates the claims made by Lei et al. (2023) regarding their proposed method, LICO, for enhancing post-hoc interpretability techniques and improving image classification performance. LICO leverages natural language supervision from a vision-language model to enrich feature representations and guide the learning process. We conduct a comprehensive reproducibility study, employing (Wide) ResNets and established interpretability methods like Grad-CAM and RISE. We were mostly unable to reproduce the authors' results. In particular, we did not find that LICO consistently led to improved classification performance or improvements in quantitative and qualitative measures of interpretability. Thus, our findings highlight the importance of rigorous evaluation and transparent reporting in interpretability research",

    "volume": "reprod",
    "abstract": "This work investigates the reproducibility of the paper \"Explaining RL decisions with trajectories\" by Deshmukh et al. (2023). The original paper introduces a novel approach in explainable reinforcement learning based on the attribution decisions of an agent to specific clusters of trajectories encountered during training. We verify the main claims from the paper, which state that (i) training on less trajectories induces a lower initial state value, (ii) trajectories in a cluster present similar high-level patterns, (iii) distant trajectories influence the decision of an agent, and (iv) humans correctly identify the attributed trajectories to the decision of the agent. We recover the environments used by the authors based on the partial original code they provided for one of the environments (Grid-World), and implemented the remaining from scratch (Seaquest and HalfCheetah, Breakout, Q*Bert). While we confirm that (i), (ii), and (iii) partially hold, we extend on the largely qualitative experiments from the authors by introducing a quantitative metric to further support (iii), and new experiments and visual results for (i). Moreover, we investigate the use of different clustering algorithms and encoder architectures to further support (ii). We could not support (iv), given the limited extent of the original experiments. We conclude that, while some of the claims can be supported, further investigations and experiments could be of interest. We recognize the novelty of the work from the authors and hope that our work paves the way for clearer and more transparent approaches",

    "title": "Reproducibility Study on Adversarial Attacks Against Robust Transformer Trackers",
    "volume": "reprod",
    "abstract": "New transformer networks have been integrated into object tracking pipelines and have demonstrated strong performance on the latest benchmarks. This paper focuses on understanding how transformer trackers behave under adversarial attacks and how different attacks perform on tracking datasets as their parameters change. We conducted a series of experiments to evaluate the effectiveness of existing adversarial attacks on object trackers with transformer and non-transformer backbones. We experimented on 7 different trackers, including 3 that are transformer-based, and 4 which leverage other architectures. These trackers are tested against 4 recent attack methods to assess their performance and robustness on VOT2022ST, UAV123 and GOT10k datasets. Our empirical study focuses on evaluating adversarial robustness of object trackers based on bounding box versus binary mask predictions, and attack methods at different levels of perturbations. Interestingly, our study found that altering the perturbation level may not significantly affect the overall object tracking results after the attack. Similarly, the sparsity and imperceptibility of the attack perturbations may remain stable against perturbation level shifts. By applying a specific attack on all transformer trackers, we show that new transformer trackers having a stronger cross-attention modeling achieve a greater adversarial robustness on tracking datasets, such as VOT2022ST and GOT10k. Our results also indicate the necessity for new attack methods to effectively tackle the latest types of transformer trackers.

    "volume": "reprod",
    "abstract": "We pursue transfer learning to improve classifier accuracy on a target task with few labeled examples available for training. Recent work suggests that using a source task to learn a prior distribution over neural net weights, not just an initialization, can boost target task performance. In this study, we carefully compare transfer learning with and without source task informed priors across 5 datasets. We find that standard transfer learning informed by an initialization only performs far better than reported in previous comparisons. The relative gains of methods using informative priors over standard transfer learning vary in magnitude across datasets. For the scenario of 5-300 examples per class, we find negative or negligible gains on 2 datasets, modest gains (between 1.5-3 points of accuracy) on 2 other datasets, and substantial gains (>8 points) on one dataset. Among methods using informative priors, we find that an isotropic covariance appears competitive with learned low-rank covariance matrix while being substantially simpler to understand and tune. Further analysis suggests that the mechanistic justification for informed priors -- hypothesized improved alignment between train and test loss landscapes -- is not consistently supported due to high variability in empirical landscapes. We release code to allow independent reproduction of all experiments",

    "abstract": "Advancements in accelerated physics simulations have greatly reduced training times for reinforcement learning policies, yet the conventional step-by-step agent-simulator interaction undermines simulation accuracy. In the real-world, interactions are asynchronous, with sensing, acting and processing happening simultaneously. Failing to capture this widens the sim2real gap and results in suboptimal real-world performance. In this paper, we address the challenges of simulating realistic asynchronicity and delays within parallelized simulations, crucial to bridging the sim2real gap in complex cyber-physical systems. Our approach efficiently parallelizes cyber-physical system simulations on accelerator hardware, including physics, sensors, actuators, processing components and their asynchronous interactions. We extend existing accelerated physics simulations with latency simulation capabilities by constructing a `supergraph' that encodes all data dependencies across parallelized simulation steps, ensuring accurate simulation. By finding the smallest supergraph, we minimize redundant computation. We validate our approach on two real-world systems and perform an extensive ablation, demonstrating superior performance compared to baseline methods",

    "volume": "reprod",
    "abstract": "We carried out a reproducibility study of InPars, which is a method for unsupervised training of neural rankers (Bonifacio et al., 2022). As a by-product, we developed InPars-light, which is a simple-yet-effective modification of InPars. Unlike InPars, InPars-light uses 7x-100x smaller ranking models and only a freely available language model BLOOM, which—as we found out—produced more accurate rankers compared to a proprietary GPT-3 model. On all five English retrieval collections (used in the original InPars study) we obtained substantial (7%-30%) and statistically significant improvements over BM25 (in nDCG and MRR) using only a 30M parameter six-layer MiniLM-30M ranker and a single three-shot prompt. In contrast, in the InPars study only a 100x larger monoT5-3B model consistently outperformed BM25, whereas their smaller monoT5-220M model (which is still 7x larger than our MiniLM ranker) outperformed BM25 only on MS MARCO and TREC DL 2020. In the same three-shot prompting scenario, our 435M parameter DeBERTA v3 ranker was at par with the 7x larger monoT5-3B (average gain over BM25 of 1.3 vs 1.32): In fact, on three out of five datasets, DeBERTA slightly outperformed monoT5-3B. Finally, these good results were achieved by re-ranking only 100 candidate documents compared to 1000 used by Bonifacio et al. (2022). We believe that InPars-light is the first truly cost-effective prompt-based unsupervised recipe to train and deploy neural ranking models that outperform BM25.

    "volume": "reprod",
    "abstract": "There has been abundant work in unsupervised domain adaptation for semantic segmentation (DAS) seeking to adapt a model trained on images from a labeled source domain to an unlabeled target domain. While the vast majority of prior work has studied this as a frame-level Image-DAS problem, a few Video-DAS works have sought to additionally leverage the temporal signal present in adjacent frames. However, Video-DAS works have historically studied a distinct set of benchmarks from Image-DAS, with minimal cross-benchmarking. In this work, we address this gap. Surprisingly, we find that (1) even after carefully controlling for data and model architecture, state-of-the-art Image-DAS methods (HRDA and HRDA+MIC)} outperform Video-DAS methods on established Video-DAS benchmarks (+14.5 mIoU on Viper$\\rightarrow$CityscapesSeq, +19.0 mIoU on Synthia$\\rightarrow$CityscapesSeq), and (2) naive combinations of Image-DAS and Video-DAS techniques only lead to marginal improvements across datasets. To avoid siloed progress between Image-DAS and Video-DAS, we open-source our codebase with support for a comprehensive set of Video-DAS and Image-DAS methods on a common benchmark.

However, their large size poses challenges in deploying them for inference in real-world applications, due to significant GPU memory requirements and high inference latency. This paper explores neural architecture search (NAS) for structural pruning to find sub-parts of the fine-tuned network that optimally trade-off efficiency, for example in terms of model size or latency, and generalization performance. We also show how we can utilize more recently developed two-stage weight-sharing NAS approaches in this setting to accelerate the search process. Unlike traditional pruning methods with fixed thresholds, we propose to adopt a multi-objective approach that identifies the Pareto optimal set of sub-networks, allowing for a more flexible and automated compression process",

    "abstract": "Graphs are a natural representation for systems based on relations between connected entities. Combinatorial optimization problems, which arise when considering an objective function related to a process of interest on discrete structures, are often challenging due to the rapid growth of the solution space. The trial-and-error paradigm of Reinforcement Learning has recently emerged as a promising alternative to traditional methods, such as exact algorithms and (meta)heuristics, for discovering better decision-making strategies in a variety of disciplines including chemistry, computer science, and statistics. Despite the fact that they arose in markedly different fields, these techniques share significant commonalities. Therefore, we set out to synthesize this work in a unifying perspective that we term Graph Reinforcement Learning, interpreting it as a constructive decision-making method for graph problems. After covering the relevant technical background, we review works along the dividing line of whether the goal is to optimize graph structure given a process of interest, or to optimize the outcome of the process itself under fixed graph structure. Finally, we discuss the common challenges facing the field and open research questions. In contrast with other surveys, the present work focuses on non-canonical graph problems for which performant algorithms are typically not known and Reinforcement Learning is able to provide efficient and effective solutions",

    "volume": "survey",
    "abstract": "A major factor in the recent success of large language models is the use of enormous and ever-growing text datasets for unsupervised pre-training. However, naively training a model on all available data may not be optimal (or feasible), as the quality of available text data can vary. Filtering out data can also decrease the carbon footprint and financial costs of training models by reducing the amount of training required. Data selection methods aim to determine which candidate data points to include in the training dataset and how to appropriately sample from the selected data points. The promise of improved data selection methods has caused the volume of research in the area to rapidly expand. However, because deep learning is mostly driven by empirical evidence and experimentation on large-scale data is expensive, few organizations have the resources for extensive data selection research. Consequently, knowledge of effective data selection practices has become concentrated within a few organizations, many of which do not openly share their findings and methodologies. To narrow this gap in knowledge, we present a comprehensive review of existing literature on data selection methods and related research areas, providing a taxonomy of existing approaches. By describing the current landscape of research, this work aims to accelerate progress in data selection by establishing an entry point for new and established researchers. Additionally, throughout this review we draw attention to noticeable holes in the literature and conclude the paper by proposing promising avenues for future research",

    "title": "A Survey of Temporal Credit Assignment in Deep Reinforcement Learning",
    "volume": "survey",
    "abstract": "The Credit Assignment Problem (CAP) refers to the longstanding challenge of Reinforcement Learning agents to associate actions with their long-term consequences. Solving the CAP is a crucial step towards the successful deployment of RL in the real world since most decision problems provide feedback that is noisy, delayed, and with little or no information about the causes. These conditions make it hard to distinguish serendipitous outcomes from those caused by informed decision-making. However, the mathematical nature of credit and the CAP remains poorly understood and defined. In this survey, we review the state of the art of Temporal Credit Assignment (CA) in deep RL. We propose a unifying formalism for credit that enables equitable comparisons of state-of-the-art algorithms and improves our understanding of the trade-offs between the various methods. We cast the CAP as the problem of learning the influence of an action over an outcome from a finite amount of experience. We discuss the challenges posed by delayed effects, dilution, and a lack of action influence, and analyse how existing methods aim to address them. Finally, we survey the protocols to evaluate a credit assignment method and suggest ways to diagnose the sources of struggle for different methods. Overall, this survey provides an overview of the field for new-entry practitioners and researchers, it offers a coherent perspective for scholars looking to expedite the starting stages of a new study on the CAP, and it suggests potential directions for future research",

    "title": "A Unified View of Differentially Private Deep Generative Modeling",
    "volume": "survey",
    "abstract": "The availability of rich and vast data sources has greatly advanced machine learning applications in various domains. However, data with privacy concerns comes with stringent regulations that frequently prohibit data access and data sharing. Overcoming these obstacles in compliance with privacy considerations is key for technological progress in many real-world application scenarios that involve sensitive data. Differentially private (DP) data publishing provides a compelling solution, where only a sanitized form of the data is publicly released, enabling privacy-preserving downstream analysis and reproducible research in sensitive domains. In recent years, various approaches have been proposed for achieving privacy-preserving high-dimensional data generation by private training on top of deep neural networks. In this paper, we present a novel unified view that systematizes these approaches. Our view provides a joint design space for systematically deriving methods that cater to different use cases. We then discuss the strengths, limitations, and inherent correlations between different approaches, aiming to shed light on crucial aspects and inspire future research. We conclude by presenting potential paths forward for the field of DP data generation, with the aim of steering the community toward making the next important steps in advancing privacy-preserving learning",

    "abstract": "Recent efforts have augmented large language models (LLMs) with external resources (e.g., the Internet) or internal control flows (e.g., prompt chaining) for tasks requiring grounding or reasoning, leading to a new class of language agents. While these agents have achieved substantial empirical success, we lack a framework to organize existing agents and plan future developments. In this paper, we draw on the rich history of cognitive science and symbolic artificial intelligence to propose Cognitive Architectures for Language Agents (CoALA). CoALA describes a language agent with modular memory components, a structured action space to interact with internal memory and external environments, and a generalized decision-making process to choose actions. We use CoALA to retrospectively survey and organize a large body of recent work, and prospectively identify actionable directions towards more capable agents. Taken together, CoALA contextualizes today's language agents within the broader history of AI and outlines a path towards language-based general intelligence",

    "volume": "survey",
    "abstract": "Graph neural networks (GNNs) have demonstrated significant promise in modelling relational data and have been widely applied in various fields of interest. The key mechanism behind GNNs is the so-called message passing where information is being iteratively aggregated to central nodes from their neighbourhood. Such a scheme has been found to be intrinsically linked to a physical process known as heat diffusion, where the propagation of GNNs naturally corresponds to the evolution of heat density. Analogizing the process of message passing to the heat dynamics allows to fundamentally understand the power and pitfalls of GNNs and consequently informs better model design. Recently, there emerges a plethora of works that proposes GNNs inspired from the continuous dynamics formulation, in an attempt to mitigate the known limitations of GNNs, such as oversmoothing and oversquashing. In this survey, we provide the first systematic and comprehensive review of studies that leverage the continuous perspective of GNNs. To this end, we introduce foundational ingredients for adapting continuous dynamics to GNNs, along with a general framework for the design of graph neural dynamics. We then review and categorize existing works based on their driven mechanisms and underlying dynamics. We also summarize how the limitations of classic GNNs can be addressed under the continuous framework. We conclude by identifying multiple open research directions",

    "abstract": "Metaheuristics have gained great success in academia and practice because their search logic can be applied to any problem with available solution representation, solution quality evaluation, and certain notions of locality. Manually designing metaheuristic algorithms for solving a target problem is criticized for being laborious, error-prone, and requiring intensive specialized knowledge. This gives rise to increasing interest in automated design of metaheuristic algorithms. With computing power to fully explore potential design choices, the automated design could reach and even surpass human-level design and could make high-performance algorithms accessible to a much wider range of researchers and practitioners. This paper presents a broad picture of automated design of metaheuristic algorithms, by conducting a survey on the common grounds and representative techniques in terms of design space, design strategies, performance evaluation strategies, and target problems in this field",

    "volume": "survey",
    "abstract": "The recent success of ChatGPT and GPT-4 has drawn widespread attention to multimodal dialogue systems. However, there is a lack of datasets in the academic community that can effectively evaluate the multimodal generation capabilities of Visual Language Models (VLMs) in textual-visual chat tasks. In this paper, we address this gap by introducing two novel multimodal datasets: the synthetic CLEVR-ATVC dataset (620K) and the manually pictured Fruit-ATVC dataset (50K). These datasets incorporate both visual and text-based inputs and outputs. Furthermore, to facilitate the accountability of multimodal systems in rejecting human requests, similar to language-based ChatGPT conversations, we introduce specific rules as supervisory signals within the datasets. This allows the trained VLM to provide a yes or no answer after engaging in visual and textual reasoning, accompanied by a language explanation to clarify the reasons behind the inability to execute the given human instruction. Our proposed method involves a two-stage training procedure, which includes training the image auto-encoder and the auto-regressive transformer from scratch. The first stage employs a discrete variational autoencoder (dVAE) to compress each image into concise tokens, which are then combined with text tokens into a single data stream. This stream is subsequently fed into the decoder-based transformer to generate visual re-creations and textual feedback in the second stage. We conduct comprehensive analyses of experimental results, focusing on re-created image quality, answer accuracy, and the model's behavior when faced with uncertainty and imperfect user queries. Through our explorations and findings, we aim to contribute valuable insights into the accountability of textual-visual generative models",

    "abstract": "Model-based Reinforcement Learning (MBRL) aims to make agents more sample-efficient, adaptive, and explainable by learning an explicit model of the environment. While the capabilities of MBRL agents have significantly improved in recent years, how to best learn the model is still an unresolved question. The majority of MBRL algorithms aim at training the model to make accurate predictions about the environment and subsequently using the model to determine the most rewarding actions. However, recent research has shown that model predictive accuracy is often not correlated with action quality, tracing the root cause to the objective mismatch between accurate dynamics model learning and policy optimization of rewards. A number of interrelated solution categories to the objective mismatch problem have emerged as MBRL continues to mature as a research area. In this work, we provide an in-depth survey of these solution categories and propose a taxonomy to foster future research",

    "abstract": "Graph neural networks are powerful tools that enable deep learning on non-Euclidean data structures like graphs, point clouds, and meshes. They leverage the connectivity of data points and can even benefit learning tasks on data, which is not naturally graph-structured -like point clouds. In these cases, the graph structure needs to be determined from the dataset, which adds a significant challenge to the learning process. This opens up a multitude of design choices for creating suitable graph structures, which have a substantial impact on the success of the graph learning task. However, so far no concrete guidance for choosing the most appropriate graph construction is available, not only due to the large variety of methods out there but also because of its strong connection to the dataset at hand. In medicine, for example, a large variety of different data types complicates the selection of graph construction methods even more. We therefore summarise the current state-of-the-art graph construction methods, especially for medical data. In this work, we introduce a categorisation scheme for graph types and graph construction methods. We identify two main strands of graph construction: static and adaptive methods, discuss their advantages and disadvantages, and formulate recommendations for choosing a suitable graph construction method. We furthermore discuss how a created graph structure can be assessed and to what degree it supports graph learning. We hope to support medical research with graph deep learning with this work by elucidating the wide variety of graph construction methods",

    "volume": "expert",
    "abstract": "Standard imitation learning can fail when the expert demonstrators have different sensory inputs than the imitating agent. This is because partial observability gives rise to hidden confounders in the causal graph. In previous work, to work around the confounding problem, policies have been trained using query access to the expert's policy or inverse reinforcement learning (IRL). However, both approaches have drawbacks as the expert's policy may not be available and IRL can be unstable in practice. Instead, we propose to train a variational inference model to infer the expert's latent information and use it to train a latent-conditional policy. We prove that using this method, under strong assumptions, the identification of the correct imitation learning policy is theoretically possible from expert demonstrations alone. In practice, we focus on a setting with less strong assumptions where we use exploration data for learning the inference model. We show in theory and practice that this algorithm converges to the correct interventional policy, solves the confounding issue, and can under certain assumptions achieve an asymptotically optimal imitation performance",

    "title": "Improving Predictor Reliability with Selective Recalibration",
    "volume": "expert",
    "abstract": "A reliable deep learning system should be able to accurately express its confidence with respect to its predictions, a quality known as calibration. One of the most effective ways to produce reliable confidence estimates with a pre-trained model is by applying a post-hoc recalibration method. Popular recalibration methods like temperature scaling are typically fit on a small amount of data and work in the model's output space, as opposed to the more expressive feature embedding space, and thus usually have only one or a handful of parameters. However, the target distribution to which they are applied is often complex and difficult to fit well with such a function. To this end we propose selective recalibration, where a selection model learns to reject some user-chosen proportion of the data in order to allow the recalibrator to focus on regions of the input space that can be well-captured by such a model. We provide theoretical analysis to motivate our algorithm, and test our method through comprehensive experiments on difficult medical imaging and zero-shot classification tasks. Our results show that selective recalibration consistently leads to significantly lower calibration error than a wide range of selection and recalibration baselines",

    "volume": "expert",
    "abstract": "In the last decades, the capacity to generate large amounts of data in science and engineering applications has been growing steadily. Meanwhile, machine learning has progressed to become a suitable tool to process and utilise the available data. Nonetheless, many relevant scientific and engineering problems present challenges where current machine learning methods cannot yet efficiently leverage the available data and resources. For example, in scientific discovery, we are often faced with the problem of exploring very large, structured and high-dimensional spaces. Moreover, the high fidelity, black-box objective function is often very expensive to evaluate. Progress in machine learning methods that can efficiently tackle such challenges would help accelerate currently crucial areas such as drug and materials discovery. In this paper, we propose a multi-fidelity active learning algorithm with GFlowNets as a sampler, to efficiently discover diverse, high-scoring candidates where multiple approximations of the black-box function are available at lower fidelity and cost. Our evaluation on molecular discovery tasks shows that multi-fidelity active learning with GFlowNets can discover high-scoring candidates at a fraction of the budget of its single-fidelity counterpart while maintaining diversity, unlike RL-based alternatives. These results open new avenues for multi-fidelity active learning to accelerate scientific discovery and engineering design",

CompoDiff and SynthTriplets18M tackle the shortages of the previous CIR approaches, such as poor generalizability due to the small dataset scale and the limited types of conditions. CompoDiff not only achieves a new state-of-the-art on four ZS-CIR benchmarks, including FashionIQ, CIRR, CIRCO, and GeneCIS, but also enables a more versatile and controllable CIR by accepting various conditions, such as negative text, and image mask conditions. CompoDiff also shows the controllability of the condition strength between text and image queries and the trade-off between inference speed and performance, which are unavailable with existing CIR methods.

    "volume": "expert",
    "abstract": "Recent analyses of neural networks with shaped activations (i.e. the activation function is scaled as the network size grows) have led to scaling limits described by differential equations. However, these results do not a priori tell us anything about ``ordinary'' unshaped networks, where the activation is unchanged as the network size grows. In this article, we find similar differential equation based asymptotic characterization for two types of unshaped networks. Firstly, we show that the following two architectures converge to the same infinite-depth-and-width limit at initialization: (i) a fully connected ResNet with a $d^{-1/2}$ factor on the residual branch, where $d$ is the network depth. (ii) a multilayer perceptron (MLP) with depth $d \\ll$ width $n$ and shaped ReLU activation at rate $d^{-1/2}$. Secondly, for an unshaped MLP at initialization, we derive the first order asymptotic correction to the layerwise correlation. In particular, if $\\rho_\\ell$ is the correlation at layer $\\ell$, then $q_t = \\ell^2 (1 - \\rho_\\ell)$ with $t = \\frac{\\ell}{n}$ converges to an SDE with a singularity at $t=0$. These results together provide a connection between shaped and unshaped network architectures, and opens up the possibility of studying the effect of normalization methods and how it connects with shaping activation functions",

To do so, we investigate a simple self-training method based on expectation-maximization, which we call \\method, where we (1) generate samples from the model and filter them using binary feedback, (2) fine-tune the model on these samples, and (3) repeat this process a few times. Testing on advanced MATH reasoning and APPS coding benchmarks using PaLM-2 models, we find that \\method{} scales favorably with model size and significantly surpasses fine-tuning only on human data.

    "abstract": "Continuous normalizing flows (CNFs) are an attractive generative modeling technique, but they have been held back by limitations in their simulation-based maximum likelihood training. We introduce the generalized conditional flow matching (CFM) technique, a family of simulation-free training objectives for CNFs. CFM features a stable regression objective like that used to train the stochastic flow in diffusion models but enjoys the efficient inference of deterministic flow models. In contrast to both diffusion models and prior CNF training algorithms, CFM does not require the source distribution to be Gaussian or require evaluation of its density. A variant of our objective is optimal transport CFM (OT-CFM), which creates simpler flows that are more stable to train and lead to faster inference, as evaluated in our experiments. Furthermore, we show that when the true OT plan is available, our OT-CFM method approximates dynamic OT. Training CNFs with CFM improves results on a variety of conditional and unconditional generation tasks, such as inferring single cell dynamics, unsupervised image translation, and Schrödinger bridge inference.

    "title": "A density estimation perspective on learning from pairwise human preferences",
    "volume": "expert",
    "abstract": "Learning from human feedback (LHF)—and in particular learning from pairwise preferences—has recently become a crucial ingredient in training large language models (LLMs), and has been the subject of much research. Most recent works frame it as a reinforcement learning problem, where a reward function is learned from pairwise preference data and the LLM is treated as a policy which is adapted to maximize the rewards, often under additional regularization constraints. We propose an alternative interpretation which centers on the generative process for pairwise preferences and treats LHF as a density estimation problem. We provide theoretical and empirical results showing that for a family of generative processes defined via preference behavior distribution equations, training a reward function on pairwise preferences effectively models an annotator's implicit preference distribution. Finally, we discuss and present findings on \"annotator misspecification\"—failure cases where wrong modeling assumptions are made about annotator behavior, resulting in poorly-adapted models—suggesting that approaches that learn from pairwise human preferences could have trouble learning from a population of annotators with diverse viewpoints",

    "volume": "expert",
    "abstract": "Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNets) are a new family of probabilistic samplers where an agent learns a stochastic policy for generating complex combinatorial structure through a series of decision-making steps. There have been recent successes in applying GFlowNets to a number of practical domains where diversity of the solutions is crucial, while reinforcement learning aims to learn an optimal solution based on the given reward function only and fails to discover diverse and high-quality solutions. However, the current GFlowNet framework is relatively limited in its applicability and cannot handle stochasticity in the reward function. In this work, we adopt a distributional paradigm for GFlowNets, turning each flow function into a distribution, thus providing more informative learning signals during training. By parameterizing each edge flow through their quantile functions, our proposed \\textit{quantile matching} GFlowNet learning algorithm is able to learn a risk-sensitive policy, an essential component for handling scenarios with risk uncertainty. Moreover, we find that the distributional approach can achieve substantial improvement on existing benchmarks compared to prior methods due to our enhanced training algorithm, even in settings with deterministic rewards",

    "title": "Leveraging Function Space Aggregation for Federated Learning at Scale",
    "volume": "expert",
    "abstract": "The federated learning paradigm has motivated the development of methods for aggregating multiple client updates into a global server model, without sharing client data. Many federated learning algorithms, including the canonical Federated Averaging (FedAvg), take a direct (possibly weighted) average of the client parameter updates, motivated by results in distributed optimization. In this work, we adopt a function space perspective and propose a new algorithm, FedFish, that aggregates local approximations to the functions learned by clients, using an estimate based on their Fisher information. We evaluate FedFish on realistic, large-scale cross-device benchmarks. While the performance of FedAvg can suffer as client models drift further apart, we demonstrate that FedFish is more robust to longer local training. Our evaluation across several settings in image and language benchmarks shows that FedFish outperforms FedAvg as local training epochs increase. Further, FedFish results in global networks that are more amenable to efficient personalization via local fine-tuning on the same or shifted data distributions. For instance, federated pretraining on the C4 dataset, followed by few-shot personalization on Stack Overflow, results in a 7% improvement in next-token prediction by FedFish over FedAvg",

On the other hand, training on synthetic attacks with small perturbations---such as word-substitution---does not actually improve robustness to human adversaries. In this paper, we propose an adversarial training framework that uses limited human adversarial examples to generate more useful adversarial examples at scale. We demonstrate the advantages of this system on the ANLI and hate speech detection benchmark datasets---both collected via an iterative, adversarial human-and-model-in-the-loop procedure. Compared to training only on observed human attacks, also training on our synthetic adversarial examples improves model robustness to future rounds.

    "volume": "expert",
    "abstract": "Leveraging the symmetries inherent to specific data domains for the construction of equivariant neural networks has lead to remarkable improvements in terms of data efficiency and generalization. However, most existing research focuses on symmetries arising from planar and volumetric data, leaving a crucial data source largely underexplored: *time-series*. In this work, we fill this gap by leveraging the symmetries inherent to time-series for the construction of equivariant neural network. We identify two core symmetries: *scale and translation*, and construct scale-translation equivariant neural networks for time-series learning. Intriguingly, we find that scale-translation equivariant mappings share strong resemblance with the *wavelet transform*. Inspired by this resemblance, we term our networks *Wavelet Networks*, and show that they perform nested non-linear wavelet-like time-frequency transforms. Empirical results show that Wavelet Networks outperform conventional CNNs on raw waveforms, and match strongly engineered spectrogram techniques across several tasks and time-series types, including audio, environmental sounds, and electrical signals.

This work focuses on the task of building theoretically principled generative models for such data. Current generative models learn $\\mathcal{M}$ by mapping an $m$-dimensional latent variable through a neural network $f_\\theta: \\mathbb{R}^m \\to \\mathbb{R}^n$. These procedures, which we call pushforward models, incur a straightforward limitation: manifolds cannot in general be represented with a single parameterization, meaning that attempts to do so will incur either computational instability or the inability to learn probability densities within the manifold. To remedy this problem, we propose to model $\\mathcal{M}$ as a neural implicit manifold: the set of zeros of a neural network. We then learn the probability density within $\\mathcal{M}$ with a constrained energy-based model, which employs a constrained variant of Langevin dynamics to train and sample from the learned manifold. In experiments on synthetic and natural data, we show that our model can learn manifold-supported distributions with complex topologies more accurately than pushforward models",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "In large-scale distributed machine learning, recent works have studied the effects of compressing gradients in stochastic optimization to alleviate the communication bottleneck. These works have collectively revealed that stochastic gradient descent (SGD) is robust to structured perturbations such as quantization, sparsification, and delays. Perhaps surprisingly, despite the surge of interest in multi-agent reinforcement learning, almost nothing is known about the analogous question: \\textit{Are common reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms also robust to similar perturbations?} We investigate this question by studying a variant of the classical temporal difference (TD) learning algorithm with a perturbed update direction, where a general compression operator is used to model the perturbation. Our work makes three important technical contributions. First, we prove that compressed TD algorithms, coupled with an error-feedback mechanism used widely in optimization, exhibit the same non-asymptotic theoretical guarantees as their SGD counterparts. Second, we show that our analysis framework extends seamlessly to nonlinear stochastic approximation schemes that subsume Q-learning. Third, we prove that for multi-agent TD learning, one can achieve linear convergence speedups with respect to the number of agents while communicating just $\\tilde{O}(1)$ bits per iteration. Notably, these are the first finite-time results in RL that account for general compression operators and error-feedback in tandem with linear function approximation and Markovian sampling. Our proofs hinge on the construction of novel Lyapunov functions that capture the dynamics of a memory variable introduced by error-feedback",

    "abstract": "Reinforcement Learning (RL) has demonstrated promising results in learning policies for complex tasks, but it often suffers from low sample efficiency and limited transferability. Hierarchical RL (HRL) methods aim to address the difficulty of learning long-horizon tasks by decomposing policies into skills, abstracting states, and reusing skills in new tasks. However, many HRL methods require some initial task success to discover useful skills, which paradoxically may be very unlikely without access to useful skills. On the other hand, reward-free HRL methods often need to learn far too many skills to achieve proper coverage in high-dimensional domains. In contrast, we introduce the Chain of Interaction Skills (COInS) algorithm, which focuses on \\textit{controllability} in factored domains to identify a small number of task-agnostic skills that allow for a high degree of control of the factored state. COInS uses learned detectors to identify interactions between state factors and then trains a chain of skills to control each of these factors successively. We evaluate COInS on a robotic pushing task with obstacles—a challenging domain where other RL and HRL methods fall short. We also demonstrate the transferability of skills learned by COInS, using variants of Breakout, a common RL benchmark, and show 2-3x improvement in both sample efficiency and final performance compared to standard RL baselines",

    "title": "Models of human preference for learning reward functions",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "The utility of reinforcement learning is limited by the alignment of reward functions with the interests of human stakeholders. One promising method for alignment is to learn the reward function from human-generated preferences between pairs of trajectory segments, a type of reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). These human preferences are typically assumed to be informed solely by partial return, the sum of rewards along each segment. We find this assumption to be flawed and propose modeling human preferences instead as informed by each segment's regret, a measure of a segment's deviation from optimal decision-making. Given infinitely many preferences generated according to regret, we prove that we can identify a reward function equivalent to the reward function that generated those preferences, and we prove that the previous partial return model lacks this identifiability property in multiple contexts. We empirically show that our proposed regret preference model outperforms the partial return preference model with finite training data in otherwise the same setting. Additionally, we find that our proposed regret preference model better predicts real human preferences and also learns reward functions from these preferences that lead to policies that are better human-aligned. Overall, this work establishes that the choice of preference model is impactful, and our proposed regret preference model provides an improvement upon a core assumption of recent research. We have open sourced our experimental code, the human preferences dataset we gathered, and our training and preference elicitation interfaces for gathering such a dataset",

    "abstract": "Continual learning is a subfield of machine learning, which aims to allow machine learning models to continuously learn on new data, by accumulating knowledge without forgetting what was learned in the past. In this work, we take a step back, and ask: \"Why should one care about continual learning in the first place?\". We set the stage by examining recent continual learning papers published at four major machine learning conferences, and show that memory-constrained settings dominate the field. Then, we discuss five open problems in machine learning, and even though they might seem unrelated to continual learning at first sight, we show that continual learning will inevitably be part of their solution. These problems are model editing, personalization and specialization, on-device learning, faster (re-)training and reinforcement learning. Finally, by comparing the desiderata from these unsolved problems and the current assumptions in continual learning, we highlight and discuss four future directions for continual learning research. We hope that this work offers an interesting perspective on the future of continual learning, while displaying its potential value and the paths we have to pursue in order to make it successful.

This paper considers the problem of \\textit{covert} or \\textit{learner-private} optimization, where the learner has to dynamically choose between learning and obfuscation by exploiting the stochasticity. The problem of controlling the stochastic gradient algorithm for covert optimization is modeled as a Markov decision process, and we show that the dynamic programming operator has a supermodular structure implying that the optimal policy has a monotone threshold structure. A computationally efficient policy gradient algorithm is proposed to search for the optimal querying policy without knowledge of the transition probabilities. As a practical application, our methods are demonstrated on a hate speech classification task in a federated setting where an eavesdropper can use the optimal weights to generate toxic content, which is more easily misclassified. Numerical results show that when the learner uses the optimal policy, an eavesdropper can only achieve a validation accuracy of $52\\%$ with no information and $69\\%$ when it has a public dataset with $10\\%$ positive samples compared to $83\\%$ when the learner employs a greedy policy",

This study aims to reproduce the results presented in \"ITI-GEN: Inclusive Text-to-Image Generation\" by Zhang et al.

We show that most of the claims made by the authors about ITI-GEN hold: it improves the diversity and quality of generated images, it is scalable to different domains, it has plug-and-play capabilities, and it is efficient from a computational point of view. However, ITI-GEN sometimes uses undesired attributes as proxy features and it is unable to disentangle some pairs of (correlated) attributes such as gender and baldness. In addition, when the number of considered attributes increases, the training time grows exponentially and ITI-GEN struggles to generate inclusive images for all elements in the joint distribution. To solve these issues, we propose using Hard Prompt Search with negative prompting, a method that does not require training and that handles negation better than vanilla Hard Prompt Search. Nonetheless, Hard Prompt Search (with or without negative prompting) cannot be used for continuous attributes that are hard to express in natural language, an area where ITI-GEN excels as it is guided by images during training.

The explorer is tested on two temporal graph models that are trained on two real-world and two synthetic datasets. The explorer is evaluated using a newly proposed metric for explanatory graph models. The authors compare the performance of their explorer to three baseline explainer methods, either adapted from a GNN explainer or developed by the authors. The authors claim that T-GNNExplainer achieves superior performance compared to the baselines when evaluated with their proposed metric. This work reproduces the original experiments by using the code (with minor adjustments), model specifications, and hyperparameters provided by the original authors. To evaluate the robustness of these claims, the method was extended to one new dataset (MOOC). Results show that the T-GNNexplainer performs best on some, but not all metrics as reported in the original findings. We conclude that the main lines of this paper hold up even though all results are less pronounced than claimed. Results show that the T-GNNExplainer does not perform similarly across different T-GNN models, precise dataset specifications are needed to obtain high performance, and there are simpler, less computationally costly explainer methods (like PBONE) that could offer competitive results",

    "title": "[Re] GNNInterpreter: A probabilistic generative model-level explanation for Graph Neural Networks",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Graph Neural Networks have recently gained recognition for their performance on graph machine learning tasks. The increasing attention on these models' trustworthiness and decision-making mechanisms has instilled interest in the exploration of explainability tech- niques, including the model proposed in \"GNNInterpreter: A probabilistic generative model- level explanation for Graph Neural Networks.\" (Wang & Shen (2022)). This work aims to reproduce the findings of the original paper, by investigation the main claims made by its authors, namely that GNNInterpreter (i) generates faithful and realistic explanations with- out requiring domain-specific knowledge, (ii) has the ability to work with various node and edge features, (iii) produces explanations that are representative for the target class and (iv) has a much lower training time compared to XGNN, the current state-of-the-art model- level GNN explanation technique. To reproduce the results, we make use of the open-source implementation and we test the interpreter on the same datasets and GNN models as in the original paper. We conduct an enhanced quantitative and qualitative evaluation, and additionally we extend the original experiments to include another real-world dataset. Our results show that we are not able to validate the first claim, due to significant hyperpa- rameter and seed variation, as well as due to training instability. Furthermore, we partially validate the second claim by testing on datasets with different node and edge features, but we reject the third claim due to GNNInterpreter's failure to outperform XGNN in producing dataset aligned explanations. Lastly, we are able to confirm the last claim",

    "title": "[Re] Explaining Temporal Graph Models through an Explorer-Navigator Framework",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Temporal graphs model complex dynamic relations that change over time, and are being used in a growing number of applications. In recent years, several graph neural networks (GNNs) were proposed, designed specifically for this temporal setting (Xu et al., 2020; Rossi et al., 2020). However, these models are notoriously hard to interpret. For this reason, the original authors (Xia et al., 2023) propose the Temporal GNN Explainer (T-GNNExplainer) – an explorer-navigator framework to efficiently compute sparse explanations of target Temporal GNNs. We reproduce the main findings of the original paper, extend their work by proposing a different type of navigator method, and examine in detail the explanation capabilities and efficiency of the provided framework within various model and hyperparameter settings. We confirm that their explainer outperforms the other baselines across nearly all datasets and metrics. Our findings suggest the navigator helps bias the search process, as well as that T-GNNExplainer can find an exact influential event set. Moreover, we examine the effect of different navigator methods and quantify the runtime-fidelity tradeoff controlled by two hyper-parameters",

    "title": "[Re] On the Reproducibility of Post-Hoc Concept Bottleneck Models",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "To obtain state-of-the-art performance, many deeper artificial intelligence models sacrifice human explainability in their decision-making. One solution proposed for achieving top performance and retaining explainability is the Post-Hoc Concept Bottleneck Model (PCBM) (Yuksekgonul et al., 2023), which can convert the embeddings of any deep neural network into a set of human-interpretable concept weights. In this work, we reproduce and expand upon the findings of Yuksekgonul et al. (2023). Our results show that while most of the authors' claims and results hold, some of the results they obtained could not be sufficiently replicated. Specifically, the claims relating to PCBM performance preservation and its non-requirement of labeled concept datasets were generally reproduced, whereas the one claiming its model editing capabilities was not. Beyond these results, our contributions to their work include evidence that PCBMs may work for audio classification problems, verification of the interpretability of their methods, and updates to their code for missing implementations.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "This paper reports on the reproducibility study on the paper `Explaining RL Decisions with Trajectories' by Deshmukh et al. (2023). The authors proposed a method to elucidate the decisions of an offline RL agent by attributing them to clusters of trajectories encountered during training. The original paper explored various environments and conducted a human study to gauge real-world performance. Our objective is to validate the effectiveness of their proposed approach. This paper conducted quantitative and qualitative experiments across three environments: a Grid-world, an Atari video game (Seaquest), and a continuous control task from MuJoCo (HalfCheetah). While the authors provided the code for the Grid-world environment, we re-implemented it for the Seaquest and HalfCheetah environments. This work extends the original paper by including trajectory rankings within a cluster, experimenting with alternative trajectory clustering, and expanding the human study. The results affirm the effectiveness of the method, both in its reproduction and in the additional experiments. However, the results of the human study suggest that the method's explanations are more challenging to interpret for humans in more complex environments. Our implementations can be found on GitHub",
