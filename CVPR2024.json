    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Hyperspectral images (HSIs) have extensive applications in various fields such as medicine agriculture and industry. Nevertheless acquiring high signal-to-noise ratio HSI poses a challenge due to narrow-band spectral filtering. Consequently the importance of HSI denoising is substantial especially for snapshot hyperspectral imaging technology. While most previous HSI denoising methods are supervised creating supervised training datasets for the diverse scenes hyperspectral cameras and scan parameters is impractical. In this work we present Diff-Unmix a self-supervised denoising method for HSI using diffusion denoising generative models. Specifically Diff-Unmix addresses the challenge of recovering noise-degraded HSI through a fusion of Spectral Unmixing and conditional abundance generation. Firstly it employs a learnable block-based spectral unmixing strategy complemented by a pure transformer-based backbone. Then we introduce a self-supervised generative diffusion network to enhance abundance maps from the spectral unmixing block. This network reconstructs noise-free Unmixing probability distributions effectively mitigating noise-induced degradations within these components. Finally the reconstructed HSI is reconstructed through unmixing reconstruction by blending the diffusion-adjusted abundance map with the spectral endmembers. Experimental results on both simulated and real-world noisy datasets show that Diff-Unmix achieves state-of-the-art performance",

By imaging the eyes of a moving person we capture multiple views of a scene outside the camera's direct line of sight through the reflections in the eyes. In this paper we reconstruct a radiance field beyond the camera's line of sight using portrait images containing eye reflections. This task is challenging due to 1) the difficulty of accurately estimating eye poses and 2) the entangled appearance of the iris textures and the scene reflections. To address these our method jointly optimizes the cornea poses the radiance field depicting the scene and the observer's eye iris texture. We further present a regularization prior on the iris texture to improve scene reconstruction quality. Through various experiments on synthetic and real-world captures featuring people with varied eye colors and lighting conditions we demonstrate the feasibility of our approach to recover the radiance field using cornea reflections",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "The recovery of occluded human meshes poses challenges for current methods due to the difficulty in extracting effective image features under severe occlusion. In this paper we introduce DPMesh an innovative framework for occluded human mesh recovery that capitalizes on the profound knowledge about object structure and spatial relationships embedded in a pre-trained text-to-image diffusion model. Unlike previous methods reliant on conventional backbones for vanilla feature extraction DPMesh seamlessly integrates the pre-trained denoising U-Net with potent priors as its image backbone and performs a single-step inference to provide occlusion-aware information. To enhance the perception capability for occluded poses DPMesh incorporates judicious guidance via condition injection which produces effective controls from 2D observations for the denoising U-Net. Furthermore we explore a dedicated noisy key-point reasoning approach to mitigate disturbances arising from occlusion and crowded scenarios. This strategy fully unleashes the perceptual capability of the diffusion prior thereby enhancing accuracy. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments affirm the efficacy of our framework as we outperform state-of-the-art methods on both occlusion-specific and standard datasets underscoring its ability to achieve precise and robust 3D human mesh recovery particularly in challenging scenarios involving occlusion and crowded scenes.

Current approaches to creating unlearnable data involve incorporating small specially designed noises but these methods strictly limit data usability overlooking its potential usage in authorized scenarios. In this paper we extend the concept of unlearnable data to conditional data learnability and introduce UnGeneralizable Examples (UGEs). UGEs exhibit learnability for authorized users while maintaining unlearnability for potential hackers. The protector defines the authorized network and optimizes UGEs to match the gradients of the original data and its ungeneralizable version ensuring learnability. To prevent unauthorized learning UGEs are trained by maximizing a designated distance loss in a common feature space. Additionally to further safeguard the authorized side from potential attacks we introduce additional undistillation optimization. Experimental results on multiple datasets and various networks demonstrate that the proposed UGEs framework preserves data usability while reducing training performance on hacker networks even under different types of attacks",

While our sophisticated lane model is capable of modeling complex road structures it also shows robust behavior since physical constraints are incorporated by means of a regularization scheme that can be analytically applied to our parametric representation. Moreover we incorporate prior knowledge about the road geometry into the 3D feature space by modeling geometry-aware spatial features guiding the network to learn an internal road surface representation.

Additionally generating 3D cities is more complex than 3D natural scenes since buildings as objects of the same class exhibit a wider range of appearances compared to the relatively consistent appearance of objects like trees in natural scenes. To address these challenges we propose CityDreamer a compositional generative model designed specifically for unbounded 3D cities. Our key insight is that 3D city generation should be a composition of different types of neural fields: 1) various building instances and 2) background stuff such as roads and green lands. Specifically we adopt the bird's eye view scene representation and employ a volumetric render for both instance-oriented and stuff-oriented neural fields. The generative hash grid and periodic positional embedding are tailored as scene parameterization to suit the distinct characteristics of building instances and background stuff. Furthermore we contribute a suite of CityGen Datasets including OSM and GoogleEarth which comprises a vast amount of real-world city imagery to enhance the realism of the generated 3D cities both in their layouts and appearances.

    "abstract": "Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection aims to address the excessive confidence prediction by neural networks by triggering an alert when the input sample deviates significantly from the training distribution (in-distribution) indicating that the output may not be reliable. Current OOD detection approaches explore all kinds of cues to identify OOD data such as finding irregular patterns in the feature space logit space gradient space or the raw image space. Surprisingly we observe a linear trend between the OOD score produced by current OOD detection algorithms and the network features on several datasets. We conduct a thorough investigation theoretically and empirically to analyze and understand the meaning of such a linear trend in OOD detection. This paper proposes a Robust Test-time Linear method (RTL) to utilize such linear trends like a `free lunch' when we have a batch of data to perform OOD detection. By using a simple linear regression as a test time adaptation we can make a more precise OOD prediction. We further propose an online variant of the proposed method which achieves promising performance and is more practical for real applications. Theoretical analysis is given to prove the effectiveness of our methods. Extensive experiments on several OOD datasets show the efficacy of RTL for OOD detection tasks significantly improving the results of base OOD detectors.

These methods are often specialized and the tasks they address are rarely extendable or customizable. We categorize these as solutions to the close-set motion control problem. In response to the complexity of practical motion control we propose and attempt to solve the open-set motion control problem. This problem is characterized by an open and fully customizable set of motion control tasks. To address this we introduce a new paradigm programmable motion generation. In this paradigm any given motion control task is broken down into a combination of atomic constraints. These constraints are then programmed into an error function that quantifies the degree to which a motion sequence adheres to them. We utilize a pre-trained motion generation model and optimize its latent code to minimize the error function of the generated motion. Consequently the generated motion not only inherits the prior of the generative model but also satisfies the requirements of the compounded constraints. Our experiments demonstrate that our approach can generate high-quality motions when addressing a wide range of unseen tasks. These tasks encompass motion control by motion dynamics geometric constraints physical laws interactions with scenes objects or the character's own body parts etc. All of these are achieved in a unified approach without the need for ad-hoc paired training data collection or specialized network designs. During the programming of novel tasks we observed the emergence of new skills beyond those of the prior model. With the assistance of large language models we also achieved automatic programming.

    "abstract": "Recently diffusion models have emerged as a new powerful generative method for 3D point cloud generation tasks. However few works study the effect of the architecture of the diffusion model in the 3D point cloud resorting to the typical UNet model developed for 2D images. Inspired by the wide adoption of Transformers we study the complementary role of convolution (from UNet) and attention (from Transformers). We discover that their respective importance change according to the timestep in the diffusion process. At early stage attention has an outsized influence because Transformers are found to generate the overall shape more quickly and at later stages when adding fine detail convolution starts having a larger impact on the generated point cloud's local surface quality. In light of this observation we propose a time-varying two-stream denoising model combined with convolution layers and transformer blocks.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "In this work we propose a method to address the challenge of rendering a 3D human from a single image in a free-view manner. Some existing approaches could achieve this by using generalizable pixel-aligned implicit fields to reconstruct a textured mesh of a human or by employing a 2D diffusion model as guidance with the Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) method to lift the 2D image into 3D space. However a generalizable implicit field often results in an over-smooth texture field while the SDS method tends to lead to a texture-inconsistent novel view with the input image. In this paper we introduce a texture-consistent back view synthesis method that could transfer the reference image content to the back view through depth-guided mutual self-attention. With this method we could achieve high-fidelity and texture-consistent human rendering from a single image. Moreover to alleviate the color distortion that occurs in the side region we propose a visibility-aware patch consistency regularization combined with the synthesized back view texture. Experiments conducted on both real and synthetic data demonstrate the effectiveness of our method and show that our approach outperforms previous baseline methods",

    "abstract": "Existing text-based person retrieval datasets often have relatively coarse-grained text annotations. This hinders the model to comprehend the fine-grained semantics of query texts in real scenarios. To address this problem we contribute a new benchmark named UFineBench for text-based person retrieval with ultra-fine granularity. Firstly we construct a new dataset named UFine6926. We collect a large number of person images and manually annotate each image with two detailed textual descriptions averaging 80.8 words each. The average word count is three to four times that of the previous datasets. In addition of standard in-domain evaluation we also propose a special evaluation paradigm more representative of real scenarios. It contains a new evaluation set with cross domains cross textual granularity and cross textual styles named UFine3C and a new evaluation metric for accurately measuring retrieval ability named mean Similarity Distribution (mSD). Moreover we propose CFAM a more efficient algorithm especially designed for text-based person retrieval with ultra fine-grained texts. It achieves fine granularity mining by adopting a shared cross-modal granularity decoder and hard negative match mechanism. With standard in-domain evaluation CFAM establishes competitive performance across various datasets especially on our ultra fine-grained UFine6926. Furthermore by evaluating on UFine3C we demonstrate that training on our UFine6926 significantly improves generalization to real scenarios compared with other coarse-grained datasets.

We parameterize the clothed human as animatable 3D Gaussians which can be efficiently splatted into image space to generate the final rendering.

Instead we attach the Gaussians onto a deformable character model and learn their parameters in 2D texture space which allows leveraging efficient 2D convolutional architectures that easily scale with the required number of Gaussians.

We demand the model to prevent hiders when defending against adversarial examples for improving accuracy and robustness simultaneously. By rethinking and redefining the min-max optimization problem for adversarial training we propose a generalized adversarial training algorithm called Hider-Focused Adversarial Training (HFAT). HFAT introduces the iterative evolution optimization strategy to simplify the optimization problem and employs an auxiliary model to reveal hiders effectively combining the optimization directions of standard adversarial training and prevention hiders. Furthermore we introduce an adaptive weighting mechanism that facilitates the model in adaptively adjusting its focus between adversarial examples and hiders during different training periods.

    "abstract": "This paper tackles a novel yet challenging problem: how to transfer knowledge from the emerging Segment Anything Model (SAM) -- which reveals impressive zero-shot instance segmentation capacity -- to learn a compact panoramic semantic segmentation model i.e. student without requiring any labeled data. This poses considerable challenges due to SAM's inability to provide semantic labels and the large capacity gap between SAM and the student. To this end we propose a novel framework called GoodSAM that introduces a teacher assistant (TA) to provide semantic information integrated with SAM to generate ensemble logits to achieve knowledge transfer. Specifically we propose a Distortion-Aware Rectification (DAR) module that first addresses the distortion problem of panoramic images by imposing prediction-level consistency and boundary enhancement. This subtly enhances TA's prediction capacity on panoramic images. DAR then incorporates a cross-task complementary fusion block to adaptively merge the predictions of SAM and TA to obtain more reliable ensemble logits. Moreover we introduce a Multi-level Knowledge Adaptation (MKA) module to efficiently transfer the multi-level feature knowledge from TA and ensemble logits to learn a compact student model. Extensive experiments on two benchmarks show that our GoodSAM achieves a remarkable +3.75% mIoU improvement over the state-of-the-art (SOTA) domain adaptation methods e.g. [41]. Also our most lightweight model achieves comparable performance to the SOTA methods with only 3.7M parameters",

To this end we develop a novel Dynamic Neural Collapse (DNC) algorithm to compute and update the optimal geometry. The DNC expands the geometry when new classes emerge without loss of the geometry optimality and guarantees the drift distance of old class prototypes with an explicit upper bound.

The setting is equivalent to observing a static object with an orbiting camera. In this paper we propose event-based structure-from-orbit (eSfO) where the aim is to simultaneously reconstruct the 3D structure of a fast spinning object observed from a static event camera and recover the equivalent orbital motion of the camera. Our contributions are threefold: since state-of-the-art event feature trackers cannot handle periodic self-occlusion due to the spinning motion we develop a novel event feature tracker based on spatio-temporal clustering and data association that can better track the helical trajectories of valid features in the event data. The feature tracks are then fed to our novel factor graph-based structure-from-orbit back-end that calculates the orbital motion parameters (e.g. spin rate relative rotational axis) that minimize the reprojection error. For evaluation we produce a new event dataset of objects under spinning motion. Comparisons against ground truth indicate the efficacy of eSfO",

It consequently results in significant performance decreases for lower-performing clients. 2) Model Aggregation Bias: existing FL approaches introduce unfair weight allocation and neglect domain diversity. It leads to biased model convergence objective and distinct performance among domains. We discover a pronounced directional update consistency in Federated Learning and propose a novel framework to tackle above issues. First leveraging the discovered characteristic we selectively discard unimportant parameter updates to prevent updates from clients with lower performance overwhelmed by unimportant parameters resulting in fairer generalization performance. Second we propose a fair aggregation objective to prevent global model bias towards some domains ensuring that the global model continuously aligns with an unbiased model.

    "abstract": "Trajectory prediction is fundamental in computer vision and autonomous driving particularly for understanding pedestrian behavior and enabling proactive decision-making. Existing approaches in this field often assume precise and complete observational data neglecting the challenges associated with out-of-view objects and the noise inherent in sensor data due to limited camera range physical obstructions and the absence of ground truth for denoised sensor data. Such oversights are critical safety concerns as they can result in missing essential non-visible objects. To bridge this gap we present a novel method for out-of-sight trajectory prediction that leverages a vision-positioning technique. Our approach denoises noisy sensor observations in an unsupervised manner and precisely maps sensor-based trajectories of out-of-sight objects into visual trajectories. This method has demonstrated state-of-the-art performance in out-of-sight noisy sensor trajectory denoising and prediction on the Vi-Fi and JRDB datasets. By enhancing trajectory prediction accuracy and addressing the challenges of out-of-sight objects our work significantly contributes to improving the safety and reliability of autonomous driving in complex environments. Our work represents the first initiative towards Out-Of-Sight Trajectory prediction (OOSTraj) setting a new benchmark for future research",

In this work we propose FAir DisEntanglement with Sensitive relevance (FADES) a novel approach that leverages conditional mutual information from the information theory perspective to address these challenges. We employ sensitive relevant code to direct correlated information between target labels and sensitive attributes by imposing conditional independence allowing better separation of the features of interest in the latent space.

    "abstract": "Modern text-to-image generation models produce high-quality images that are both photorealistic and faithful to the text prompts. However this quality comes at significant computational cost: nearly all of these models are iterative and require running sampling multiple times with large models. This iterative process is needed to ensure that different regions of the image are not only aligned with the text prompt but also compatible with each other. In this work we propose a light-weight approach to achieving this compatibility between different regions of an image using a Markov Random Field (MRF) model. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this method on top of the latent token-based Muse text-to-image model. The MRF richly encodes the compatibility among image tokens at different spatial locations to improve quality and significantly reduce the required number of Muse sampling steps. Inference with the MRF is significantly cheaper and its parameters can be quickly learned through back-propagation by modeling MRF inference as a differentiable neural-network layer. Our full model MarkovGen uses this proposed MRF model to both speed up Muse by 1.5xand produce higher quality images by decreasing undesirable image artifacts",

While most existing methods rely on fully-supervised learning the manual labeling of point cloud data is laborious and time-consuming. Therefore several annotation-efficient methods have been proposed to address this challenge. Although effective these methods rely on weak annotations or additional multi-modal data like images and the potential benefits inherent in the point cloud sequence are still underexplored. To this end we explore the feasibility of self-supervised motion prediction with only unlabeled LiDAR point clouds. Initially we employ an optimal transport solver to establish coarse correspondences between current and future point clouds as the coarse pseudo motion labels. Training models directly using such coarse labels leads to noticeable spatial and temporal prediction inconsistencies. To mitigate these issues we introduce three simple spatial and temporal regularization losses which facilitate the self-supervised training process effectively.

We solve this problem by our HashPoint method combining these two strategies leveraging rasterization for efficient point searching and sampling and ray marching for rendering. Our method optimizes point searching by rasterizing points within the camera's view organizing them in a hash table and facilitating rapid searches.

Existing methods have been proposed to address the domain gap using the semi-supervised student-teacher framework. However a fundamental issue arises from the class imbalance in the labelled training set which can result in inaccurate pseudo-labels. The relationship between classes especially where one class is a majority and the other minority has a large impact on class bias. We propose Class-Aware Teacher (CAT) to address the class bias issue in the domain adaptation setting. In our work we approximate the class relationships with our Inter-Class Relation module (ICRm) and exploit it to reduce the bias within the model. In this way we are able to apply augmentations to highly related classes both inter- and intra-domain to boost the performance of minority classes while having minimal impact on majority classes. We further reduce the bias by implementing a class-relation weight to our classification loss. Experiments conducted on various datasets and ablation studies show that our method is able to address the class bias in the domain adaptation setting. On the Cityscapes ?

In this paper we introduce a novel VLP framework designed to dissect disease descriptions into their fundamental aspects leveraging prior knowledge about the visual manifestations of pathologies.

Integrating a Transformer module our approach aligns an input image with the diverse elements of a disease generating aspect-centric image representations. By consolidating the matches from each aspect we improve the compatibility between an image and its associated disease. Additionally capitalizing on the aspect-oriented representations we present a dual-head Transformer tailored to process known and unknown diseases optimizing the comprehensive detection efficacy.

In MoMask a hierarchical quantization scheme is employed to represent human motion as multi-layer discrete motion tokens with high-fidelity details. Starting at the base layer with a sequence of motion tokens obtained by vector quantization the residual tokens of increasing orders are derived and stored at the subsequent layers of the hierarchy. This is consequently followed by two distinct bidirectional transformers. For the base-layer motion tokens a Masked Transformer is designated to predict randomly masked motion tokens conditioned on text input at training stage. During generation (i.e. inference) stage starting from an empty sequence our Masked Transformer iteratively fills up the missing tokens; Subsequently a Residual Transformer learns to progressively predict the next-layer tokens based on the results from current layer. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MoMask outperforms the state-of-art methods on the text-to-motion generation task with an FID of 0.045 (vs e.g. 0.141 of T2M-GPT) on the HumanML3D dataset and 0.228 (vs 0.514) on KIT-ML respectively.

    "abstract": "Inverse rendering aims at recovering both geometry and materials of objects. It provides a more compatible reconstruction for conventional rendering engines compared with the neural radiance fields (NeRFs). On the other hand existing NeRF-based inverse rendering methods cannot handle glossy objects with local light interactions well as they typically oversimplify the illumination as a 2D environmental map which assumes infinite lights only. Observing the superiority of NeRFs in recovering radiance fields we propose a novel 5D Neural Plenoptic Function (NeP) based on NeRFs and ray tracing such that more accurate lighting-object interactions can be formulated via the rendering equation. We also design a material-aware cone sampling strategy to efficiently integrate lights inside the BRDF lobes with the help of pre-filtered radiance fields. Our method has two stages: the geometry of the target object and the pre-filtered environmental radiance fields are reconstructed in the first stage and materials of the target object are estimated in the second stage with the proposed NeP and material-aware cone sampling strategy. Extensive experiments on the proposed real-world and synthetic datasets demonstrate that our method can reconstruct high-fidelity geometry/materials of challenging glossy objects with complex lighting interactions from nearby objects.

A standard task in computer vision or more generally in engineering and applied sciences is fitting a flat to a set of points which is commonly solved using the PCA. We generalize this technique to enable fitting a flat to a set of other flats possibly of varying dimensions based on representing the flats as squared distance fields. Compared to previous approaches such as Riemannian centers of mass in the manifold of affine Grassmannians our approach is conceptually much simpler and computationally more efficient yet offers desirable properties such as respecting symmetries and being equivariant to rigid transformations leading to more intuitive and useful results in practice.

In some practical scenarios emphasizing local differences is crucial for accurately identifying a correct match thereby enhancing the overall robustness and reliability of the matching process. Commonly used shape descriptors have several limitations and often fail to provide meaningful local insights about the paired geometries. In this work we propose a new technique based on graph Laplacian eigenmaps to match point clouds by taking into account fine local structures. To deal with the order and sign ambiguity of Laplacian eigenmaps we introduce a new operator called Coupled Laplacian that allows to easily generate aligned eigenspaces for multiple registered geometries. We show that the similarity between those aligned high-dimensional spaces provides a locally meaningful score to match shapes. We firstly evaluate the performance of the proposed technique in a point-wise manner focusing on the task of object anomaly localization on the MVTec 3D-AD dataset. Additionally we define a new medical task called automatic Bone Side Estimation (BSE) which we address through a global similarity score derived from coupled eigenspaces. In order to test it we propose a benchmark collecting bone surface structures from various public datasets.

In this paper we present Desigen an automatic template creation pipeline which generates background images as well as harmonious layout elements over the background. Different from natural images a background image should preserve enough non-salient space for the overlaying layout elements. To equip existing advanced diffusion-based models with stronger spatial control we propose two simple but effective techniques to constrain the saliency distribution and reduce the attention weight in desired regions during the background generation process. Then conditioned on the background we synthesize the layout with a Transformer-based autoregressive generator. To achieve a more harmonious composition we propose an iterative inference strategy to adjust the synthesized background and layout in multiple rounds. We constructed a design dataset with more than 40k advertisement banners to verify our approach. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed pipeline generates high-quality templates comparable to human designers.

Our results from a comprehensive set of experiments investigating different training strategies show this general approach improves performance on a range of downstream auditory and audiovisual tasks without majorly affecting linguistic task performance overall.

    "title": "Multi-criteria Token Fusion with One-step-ahead Attention for Efficient Vision Transformers",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Vision Transformer (ViT) has emerged as a prominent backbone for computer vision. For more efficient ViTs recent works lessen the quadratic cost of the self-attention layer by pruning or fusing the redundant tokens. However these works faced the speed-accuracy trade-off caused by the loss of information. Here we argue that token fusion needs to consider diverse relations between tokens to minimize information loss. In this paper we propose a Multi-criteria Token Fusion (MCTF) that gradually fuses the tokens based on multi-criteria (i.e. similarity informativeness and size of fused tokens). Further we utilize the one-step-ahead attention which is the improved approach to capture the informativeness of the tokens. By training the model equipped with MCTF using a token reduction consistency we achieve the best speed-accuracy trade-off in the image classification (ImageNet1K). Experimental results prove that MCTF consistently surpasses the previous reduction methods with and without training. Specifically DeiT-T and DeiT-S with MCTF reduce FLOPs by about 44% while improving the performance (+0.5% and +0.3%) over the base model respectively. We also demonstrate the applicability of MCTF in various Vision Transformers (e.g. T2T-ViT LV-ViT) achieving at least 31% speedup without performance degradation.

    "abstract": "The spiking cameras offer the benefits of high dynamic range (HDR) high temporal resolution and low data redundancy. However reconstructing HDR videos in high-speed conditions using single-bit spikings presents challenges due to the limited bit depth. Increasing the bit depth of the spikings is advantageous for boosting HDR performance but the readout efficiency will be decreased which is unfavorable for achieving a high frame rate (HFR) video. To address these challenges we propose a readout mechanism to obtain rolling-mixed-bit (RMB) spikings which involves interleaving multi-bit spikings within the single-bit spikings in a rolling manner thereby combining the characteristics of high bit depth and efficient readout. Furthermore we introduce RMB-Net for reconstructing HDR and HFR videos. RMB-Net comprises a cross-bit attention block for fusing mixed-bit spikings and a cross-time attention block for achieving temporal fusion. Extensive experiments conducted on synthetic and real-synthetic data demonstrate the superiority of our method. For instance pure 3-bit spikings result in 3 times of data volume whereas our method achieves comparable performance with less than 2% increase in data volume",

    "abstract": "Most current arbitrary-scale image super-resolution (SR) methods has commonly relied on simulated data generated by simple synthetic degradation models (e.g. bicubic downsampling) at continuous various scales thereby falling short in capturing the complex degradation of real-world images. This limitation hinders the visual quality of these methods when applied to real-world images. To address this issue we propose the Continuous Optical Zooming dataset (COZ) by constructing an automatic imaging system to collect images at fine-grained various focal lengths within a specific range and providing strict image pair alignment. The COZ dataset serves as a benchmark to provide real-world data for training and testing arbitrary-scale SR models. To enhance the model's robustness against real-world image degradation we propose a Local Mix Implicit network (LMI) based on the MLP-mixer architecture and meta-learning which directly learns the local texture information by simultaneously mixing features and coordinates of multiple independent points. The extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of the arbitrary-scale SR models trained on the COZ dataset compared to models trained on simulated data. Our LMI model exhibits the superior effectiveness compared to other models. This study is of great significance in developing more efficient algorithms and improving the performance of arbitrary-scale image SR methods in practical applications.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Gaze is a powerful form of non-verbal communication that humans develop from an early age. As such modeling this behavior is an important task that can benefit a broad set of application domains ranging from robotics to sociology. In particular the gaze following task in computer vision is defined as the prediction of the 2D pixel coordinates where a person in the image is looking. Previous attempts in this area have primarily centered on CNN-based architectures but they have been constrained by the need to process one person at a time which proves to be highly inefficient. In this paper we introduce a novel and effective multi-person transformer-based architecture for gaze prediction. While there exist prior works using transformers for multi-person gaze prediction they use a fixed set of learnable embeddings to decode both the person and its gaze target which requires a matching step afterward to link the predictions with the annotations. Thus it is difficult to quantitatively evaluate these methods reliably with the available benchmarks or integrate them into a larger human behavior understanding system. Instead we are the first to propose a multi-person transformer-based architecture that maintains the original task formulation and ensures control over the people fed as input. Our main contribution lies in encoding the person-specific information into a single controlled token to be processed alongside image tokens and using its output for prediction based on a novel multiscale decoding mechanism. Our new architecture achieves state-of-the-art results on the GazeFollow VideoAttentionTarget and ChildPlay datasets and outperforms comparable multi-person architectures with a notable margin.

To address this challenge recent works propose to utilize CLIP as an additional classifier and aggregate model predictions with CLIP classification results. Despite their remarkable progress performance of OVS methods in relevant scenarios is still unsatisfactory compared with supervised counterparts. We attribute this to the in-vocabulary embedding and domain-biased CLIP prediction. To this end we present a Semantic-assisted CAlibration Network (SCAN). In SCAN we incorporate generalized semantic prior of CLIP into proposal embedding to avoid collapsing on known categories. Besides a contextual shift strategy is applied to mitigate the lack of global context and unnatural background noise. With above designs SCAN achieves state-of-the-art performance on all popular open-vocabulary segmentation benchmarks.

In this paper we propose MatchU a Fuse-Describe-Match strategy for 6D pose estimation from RGB-D images. MatchU is a generic approach that fuses 2D texture and 3D geometric cues for 6D pose prediction of unseen objects. We rely on learning geometric 3D descriptors that are rotation-invariant by design. By encoding pose-agnostic geometry the learned descriptors naturally generalize to unseen objects and capture symmetries. To tackle ambiguous associations using 3D geometry only we fuse additional RGB information into our descriptor. This is achieved through a novel attention-based mechanism that fuses cross-modal information together with a matching loss that leverages the latent space learned from RGB data to guide the descriptor learning process. Extensive experiments reveal the generalizability of both the RGB-D fusion strategy as well as the descriptor efficacy. Benefiting from the novel designs MatchU surpasses all existing methods by a significant margin in terms of both accuracy and speed even without the requirement of expensive re-training or rendering",

While this may appear to be a reasonable approach we demonstrate that doing so does not correlate to human preference when the estimated lighting is used to relight a virtual scene into a real photograph. To study this we design a controlled psychophysical experiment where human observers must choose their preference amongst rendered scenes lit using a set of lighting estimation algorithms selected from the recent literature and use it to analyse how these algorithms perform according to human perception. Then we demonstrate that none of the most popular IQA metrics from the literature taken individually correctly represent human perception. Finally we show that by learning a combination of existing IQA metrics we can more accurately represent human preference. This provides a new perceptual framework to help evaluate future lighting estimation algorithms.

To solve this challenge we propose distortion-guided unsupervised domain adaptation for BIQA (DGQA) a novel framework that leverages adaptive multi-domain selection via prior knowledge from distortion to match the data distribution between the source domains and the target domain thereby reducing negative transfer from the outlier source domains. Extensive experiments on two cross-domain settings (synthetic distortion to authentic distortion and synthetic distortion to algorithmic distortion) have demonstrated the effectiveness of our proposed DGQA.

This paper presents the first exploration of video data replay techniques for incremental action segmentation focusing on action temporal modeling. We propose a Temporally Coherent Action (TCA) model which represents actions using a generative model instead of storing individual frames. The integration of a conditioning variable that captures temporal coherence allows our model to understand the evolution of action features over time. Therefore action segments generated by TCA for replay are diverse and temporally coherent.

Our core intuition is to marry the 3D Gaussian representation with non-rigid tracking achieving a compact and compression-friendly representation.

Then we utilize a 4D Gaussian optimization scheme with adaptive spatial-temporal regularizers to effectively balance the non-rigid prior and Gaussian updating. We also present a companion compression scheme with residual compensation for immersive experiences on various platforms.

To address this limitation we propose EfficientSAMs light-weight SAM models that exhibits decent performance with largely reduced complexity. Our idea is based on leveraging masked image pretraining SAMI which learns to reconstruct features from SAM image encoder for effective visual representation learning.

We perform evaluations on multiple vision tasks including image classification object detection instance segmentation and semantic segmentation and find that our proposed pretraining method SAMI consistently outperforms other masked image pretraining methods. On segment anything task such as zero-shot instance segmentation our EfficientSAMs with SAMI-pretrained lightweight image encoders perform favorably with a significant gain (e.g. 4 AP on COCO/LVIS) over other fast SAM models.

Given unstructured language instructions the agent first generates textually described traffic scenarios using LLMs. These scenario descriptions are subsequently broken down into several sub-descriptions for specified details such as behaviors and locations of vehicles. The agent then distinctively transforms the textually described sub-scenarios into domain-specific languages which then generate actual code for prediction and control in simulators facilitating the creation of diverse and complex scenarios within the CARLA simulation environment. A key part of our agent is a comprehensive knowledge retrieval component which efficiently translates specific textual descriptions into corresponding domain-specific code snippets by training a knowledge database containing the scenario description and code pairs. Extensive experimental results underscore the efficacy of ChatScene in improving the safety of autonomous vehicles. For instance the scenarios generated by ChatScene show a 15% increase in collision rates compared to state-of-the-art baselines when tested against different reinforcement learning-based ego vehicles. Furthermore we show that by using our generated safety-critical scenarios to fine-tune different RL-based autonomous driving models they can achieve a 9% reduction in collision rates surpassing current SOTA methods. ChatScene effectively bridges the gap between textual descriptions of traffic scenarios and practical CARLA simulations providing a unified way to conveniently generate safety-critical scenarios for safety testing and improvement for AVs",

SAM follows a pipeline that separates interactive segmentation into image preprocessing through a large encoder and interactive inference via a lightweight decoder ensuring efficient real-time performance. However SAM faces stability issues in challenging samples upon this pipeline. These issues arise from two main factors. Firstly the image preprocessing disables SAM to dynamically use image-level zoom-in strategies to refocus on the target object during interaction. Secondly the lightweight decoder struggles to sufficiently integrate interactive information with image embeddings. To address these two limitations we propose FocSAM with a pipeline redesigned on two pivotal aspects. First we propose Dynamic Window Multi-head Self-Attention (Dwin-MSA) to dynamically refocus SAM's image embeddings on the target object. Dwin-MSA localizes attention computations around the target object enhancing object-related embeddings with minimal computational overhead. Second we propose Pixel-wise Dynamic ReLU (P-DyReLU) to enable sufficient integration of interactive information from a few initial clicks that have significant impacts on the overall segmentation results. Experimentally FocSAM augments SAM's interactive segmentation performance to match the existing state-of-the-art method in segmentation quality requiring only about 5.6% of this method's inference time on CPUs.

Remarkable success has been achieved in the language domain by using reinforcement learning (RL) to maximize rewards that reflect human preference. However in the vision domain existing RL-based reward finetuning methods are limited by their instability in large-scale training rendering them incapable of generalizing to complex unseen prompts. In this paper we propose Proximal Reward Difference Prediction (PRDP) enabling stable black-box reward finetuning for diffusion models for the first time on large-scale prompt datasets with over 100K prompts. Our key innovation is the Reward Difference Prediction (RDP) objective that has the same optimal solution as the RL objective while enjoying better training stability. Specifically the RDP objective is a supervised regression objective that tasks the diffusion model with predicting the reward difference of generated image pairs from their denoising trajectories. We theoretically prove that the diffusion model that obtains perfect reward difference prediction is exactly the maximizer of the RL objective. We further develop an online algorithm with proximal updates to stably optimize the RDP objective. In experiments we demonstrate that PRDP can match the reward maximization ability of well-established RL-based methods in small-scale training. Furthermore through large-scale training on text prompts from the Human Preference Dataset v2 and the Pick-a-Pic v1 dataset PRDP achieves superior generation quality on a diverse set of complex unseen prompts whereas RL-based methods completely fail",

    "abstract": "Data-Free Meta-Learning (DFML) aims to extract knowledge from a collection of pre-trained models without requiring the original data presenting practical benefits in contexts constrained by data privacy concerns. Current DFML methods primarily focus on the data recovery from these pre-trained models. However they suffer from slow recovery speed and overlook gaps inherent in heterogeneous pre-trained models. In response to these challenges we introduce the Faster and Better Data-Free Meta-Learning (FREE) framework which contains: (i) a meta-generator for rapidly recovering training tasks from pre-trained models; and (ii) a meta-learner for generalizing to new unseen tasks. Specifically within the module Faster Inversion via Meta-Generator each pre-trained model is perceived as a distinct task. The meta-generator can rapidly adapt to a specific task in just five steps significantly accelerating the data recovery. Furthermore we propose Better Generalization via Meta-Learner and introduce an implicit gradient alignment algorithm to optimize the meta-learner. This is achieved as aligned gradient directions alleviate potential conflicts among tasks from heterogeneous pre-trained models. Empirical experiments on multiple benchmarks affirm the superiority of our approach marking a notable speed-up (20x) and performance enhancement (1.42% 4.78%) in comparison to the state-of-the-art",

However due to the significant cross-task gap the respective fusion mechanism varies considerably in practice resulting in limited performance across subtasks. To handle this problem we propose a novel task-customized mixture of adapters (TC-MoA) for general image fusion adaptively prompting various fusion tasks in a unified model. We borrow the insight from the mixture of experts (MoE) taking the experts as efficient tuning adapters to prompt a pre-trained foundation model. These adapters are shared across different tasks and constrained by mutual information regularization ensuring compatibility with different tasks while complementarity for multi-source images. The task-specific routing networks customize these adapters to extract task-specific information from different sources with dynamic dominant intensity performing adaptive visual feature prompt fusion. Notably our TC-MoA controls the dominant intensity bias for different fusion tasks successfully unifying multiple fusion tasks in a single model. Extensive experiments show that TC-MoA outperforms the competing approaches in learning commonalities while retaining compatibility for general image fusion (multi-modal multi-exposure and multi-focus) and also demonstrating striking controllability on more generalization experiments.

This manner relieves the student's head from receiving contradictory supervision signals from the annotations and the teacher's predictions greatly improving the student's detection performance. Moreover as mimicking the teacher's predictions is the target of KD CrossKD offers more task-oriented information in contrast with feature imitation. On MS COCO with only prediction mimicking losses applied our CrossKD boosts the average precision of GFL ResNet-50 with 1x training schedule from 40.2 to 43.7 outperforming all existing KD methods.

    "abstract": "One-shot medical image segmentation (MIS) aims to cope with the expensive time-consuming and inherent human bias annotations. One prevalent method to address one-shot MIS is joint registration and segmentation (JRS) with a shared encoder which mainly explores the voxel-wise correspondence between the labeled data and unlabeled data for better segmentation. However this method omits underlying connections between task-specific decoders for segmentation and registration leading to unstable training. In this paper we propose a novel Bi-level Learning of Task-Specific Decoders for one-shot MIS employing a pretrained fixed shared encoder that is proved to be more quickly adapted to brand-new datasets than existing JRS without fixed shared encoder paradigm. To be more specific we introduce a bi-level optimization training strategy considering registration as a major objective and segmentation as a learnable constraint by leveraging inter-task coupling dependencies. Furthermore we design an appearance conformity constraint strategy that learns the backward transformations generating the fake labeled data used to perform data augmentation instead of the labeled image to avoid performance degradation caused by inconsistent styles between unlabeled data and labeled data in previous methods. Extensive experiments on the brain MRI task across ABIDE ADNI and PPMI datasets demonstrate that the proposed Bi-JROS outperforms state-of-the-art one-shot MIS methods for both segmentation and registration tasks.

For example foundation models for geospatial and satellite remote sensing applications are commonly trained on large optical RGB or multi-spectral datasets although data from a wide variety of heterogeneous sensors are available in the remote sensing domain. This leads to significant discrepancies between pre-training and downstream target data distributions for many important applications. Fine-tuning large foundation models to bridge that gap incurs high computational cost and can be infeasible when target datasets are small. In this paper we address the question of how large pre-trained foundational transformer models can be efficiently adapted to downstream remote sensing tasks involving different data modalities or limited dataset size. We present a self-supervised adaptation method that boosts downstream linear evaluation accuracy of different foundation models by 4-6% (absolute) across 8 remote sensing datasets while outperforming full fine-tuning when training only 1-2% of the model parameters.

In this paper we discuss for the first time the concept of continual adversarial defense under a sequence of attacks and propose a lifelong defense baseline called Anisotropic & Isotropic Replay (AIR) which offers three advantages: (1) Isotropic replay ensures model consistency in the neighborhood distribution of new data indirectly aligning the output preference between old and new tasks. (2) Anisotropic replay enables the model to learn a compromise data manifold with fresh mixed semantics for further replay constraints and potential future attacks. (3) A straightforward regularizer mitigates the 'plasticity-stability' trade-off by aligning model output between new and old tasks.

Despite achieving promising performance on certain metrics existing methods commonly suffer from drawbacks.

Recent approaches are predominantly focused on cross-projection fusion with geometry-based re-projection: they fuse 360 images with equirectangular projection (ERP) and another projection type e.g. cubemap projection to estimate depth with the ERP format. However these methods suffer from 1) limited local receptive fields making it hardly possible to capture large FoV scenes and 2) prohibitive computational cost caused by the complex cross-projection fusion module design. In this paper we propose Elite360D a novel framework that inputs the ERP image and icosahedron projection (ICOSAP) point set which is undistorted and spatially continuous. Elite360D is superior in its capacity in learning a representation from a local-with-global perspective. With a flexible ERP image encoder it includes an ICOSAP point encoder and a Bi-projection Bi-attention Fusion (B2F) module (totally 1M parameters). Specifically the ERP image encoder can take various perspective image-trained backbones (e.g. ResNet Transformer) to extract local features. The point encoder extracts the global features from the ICOSAP. Then the B2F module captures the semantic- and distance-aware dependencies between each pixel of the ERP feature and the entire ICOSAP feature set.

Weakly supervised RIS thus learns from image-text pairs to pixel-level semantics which is challenging for segmenting fine-grained masks.

Nevertheless we observe that simply integrating SAM yields limited benefits and can even lead to performance regression due to the inevitable noise issues and challenges in excessive focus on object parts. In this paper we present an innovative framework Point PrompTing (PPT) incorporated with the proposed multi-source curriculum learning strategy to address these challenges. Specifically the core of PPT is a point generator that not only harnesses CLIP's text-image alignment capability and SAM's powerful mask generation ability but also generates negative point prompts to address the noisy and excessive focus issues inherently and effectively. In addition we introduce a curriculum learning strategy with object-centric images to help PPT gradually learn from simpler yet precise semantic alignment to more complex RIS.

Tackling this novel problem is non-trivial due to the novelty of event cameras and the distinct modality gap between images and events. In particular as only the source model is available a hurdle is how to extract the knowledge from the source model by only using the unlabeled target event data while achieving knowledge transfer. To this end we propose a novel framework dubbed EventDance for this unsupervised source-free cross-modal adaptation problem. Importantly inspired by event-to-video reconstruction methods we propose a reconstruction-based modality bridging (RMB) module which reconstructs intensity frames from events in a self-supervised manner. This makes it possible to build up the surrogate images to extract the knowledge (i.e. labels) from the source model. We then propose a multi-representation knowledge adaptation (MKA) module that transfers the knowledge to target models learning events with multiple representation types for fully exploring the spatiotemporal information of events. The two modules connecting the source and target models are mutually updated so as to achieve the best performance.

The lowered resolution between adjacent slices poses challenges hindering optimal viewing experiences and impeding the development of robust downstream analysis algorithms. Various volumetric super-resolution algorithms aim to surmount these challenges enhancing inter-slice resolution and overall 3D medical imaging quality. However existing approaches confront inherent challenges: 1) often tailored to specific upsampling factors lacking flexibility for diverse clinical scenarios; 2) newly generated slices frequently suffer from over-smoothing degrading fine details and leading to inter-slice inconsistency. In response this study presents CycleINR a novel enhanced Implicit Neural Representation model for 3D medical data volumetric super-resolution. Leveraging the continuity of the learned implicit function the CycleINR model can achieve results with arbitrary up-sampling rates eliminating the need for separate training.

As off-the-shelf features (OSF) from pre-trained models do not directly serve image restoration we propose to learn an additional lightweight module called Pre-Train-Guided Refinement Module (PTG-RM) to refine restoration results of a target restoration network with OSF. PTG-RM consists of two components Pre-Train-Guided Spatial-Varying Enhancement (PTG-SVE) and Pre-Train-Guided Channel-Spatial Attention (PTG-CSA). PTG-SVE enables optimal short- and long-range neural operations while PTG-CSA enhances spatial-channel attention for restoration-related learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PTG-RM with its compact size (<1M parameters) effectively enhances restoration performance of various models across different tasks including low-light enhancement deraining deblurring and denoising",

    "abstract": "Face Video Retouching is a complex task that often requires labor-intensive manual editing. Conventional image retouching methods perform less satisfactorily in terms of generalization performance and stability when applied to videos without exploiting the correlation among frames. To address this issue we propose a Video Retouching transformEr to remove facial imperfections in videos which is referred to as VRetouchEr. Specifically we estimate the apparent motion of imperfections between two consecutive frames and the resulting displacement vectors are used to refine the imperfection map which is synthesized from the current frame together with the corresponding encoder features. The flow-based imperfection refinement is critical for precise and stable retouching across frames. To leverage the temporal contextual information we inject the refined imperfection map into each transformer block for multi-frame masked attention computation such that we can capture the interdependence between the current frame and multiple reference frames. As a result the imperfection regions can be replaced with normal skin with high fidelity while at the same time keeping the other regions unchanged. Extensive experiments are performed to verify the superiority of VRetouchEr over state-of-the-art image retouching methods in terms of fidelity and stability",

    "abstract": "Deep neural networks (DNNs) are vulnerable to highly transferable adversarial attacks. Especially many studies have shown that sparse attacks pose a significant threat to DNNs on account of their exceptional imperceptibility. Current sparse attack methods mostly limit only the magnitude and number of perturbations while generally overlooking the location of the perturbations resulting in decreased performances on attack transferability. A subset of studies indicates that perturbations existing in the significant regions with rich classification-relevant features are more effective. Leveraging this insight we introduce the structural sparsity constraint in the framework of generative models to limit the perturbation positions. To ensure that the perturbations are generated towards classification-relevant regions we propose an exact group sparsity training method to learn pixel-level and group-level sparsity. For purpose of improving the effectiveness of sparse training we further put forward masked quantization network and multi-stage optimization algorithm in the training process. Utilizing CNNs as surrogate models extensive experiments demonstrate that our method has higher transferability in image classification attack compared to state-of-the-art methods at approximately same sparsity levels. In cross-model ViT object detection and semantic segmentation attack tasks we also achieve a better attack success rate. Code is available at https://github.com/MisterRpeng/EGS-TSSA",

    "abstract": "Super-resolution (SR) and image generation are important tasks in computer vision and are widely adopted in real-world applications. Most existing methods however generate images only at fixed-scale magnification and suffer from over-smoothing and artifacts. Additionally they do not offer enough diversity of output images nor image consistency at different scales. Most relevant work applied Implicit Neural Representation (INR) to the denoising diffusion model to obtain continuous-resolution yet diverse and high-quality SR results. Since this model operates in the image space the larger the resolution of image is produced the more memory and inference time is required and it also does not maintain scale-specific consistency. We propose a novel pipeline that can super-resolve an input image or generate from a random noise a novel image at arbitrary scales. The method consists of a pretrained auto-encoder a latent diffusion model and an implicit neural decoder and their learning strategies. The proposed method adopts diffusion processes in a latent space thus efficient yet aligned with output image space decoded by MLPs at arbitrary scales. More specifically our arbitrary-scale decoder is designed by the symmetric decoder w/o up-scaling from the pretrained auto-encoder and Local Implicit Image Function (LIIF) in series. The latent diffusion process is learnt by the denoising and the alignment losses jointly. Errors in output images are backpropagated via the fixed decoder improving the quality of output images. In the extensive experiments using multiple public benchmarks on the two tasks i.e. image super-resolution and novel image generation at arbitrary scales the proposed method outperforms relevant methods in metrics of image quality diversity and scale consistency. It is significantly better than the relevant prior-art in the inference speed and memory usage",

In this paper we propose a method to infer occupancy fields instead of SDFs as they are easier to learn from sparse inputs. We leverage a margin-based uncertainty measure to differentiably sample from the decision boundary of the occupancy function and supervise the sampled boundary points using the input point cloud. We further stabilise the optimization process at the early stages of the training by biasing the occupancy function towards minimal entropy fields while maximizing its entropy at the input point cloud.

Our work considers extreme points as a part of the true instance mask and propagates them to identify potential foreground and background points which are all together used for training a pseudo label generator. Then pseudo labels given by the generator are in turn used for supervised learning of our final model.

However one of the major drawbacks of diffusion models is that the image generation process is costly. A large image-to-image network has to be applied many times to iteratively refine an image from random noise. While many recent works propose techniques to reduce the number of required steps they generally treat the underlying denoising network as a black box. In this work we investigate the behavior of the layers within the network and find that 1) the layers' output changes smoothly over time 2) the layers show distinct patterns of change and 3) the change from step to step is often very small. We hypothesize that many layer computations in the denoising network are redundant. Leveraging this we introduce Block Caching in which we reuse outputs from layer blocks of previous steps to speed up inference. Furthermore we propose a technique to automatically determine caching schedules based on each block's changes over timesteps. In our experiments we show through FID human evaluation and qualitative analysis that Block Caching allows to generate images with higher visual quality at the same computational cost. We demonstrate this for different state-of-the-art models (LDM and EMU) and solvers (DDIM and DPM)",

However owing to the ill-posed nature of this problem there has been no solution that can provide consistent high-quality novel views from camera positions that are significantly different from the training views. In this work we introduce Neural Parametric Gaussians (NPGs) to take on this challenge by imposing a two-stage approach: first we fit a low-rank neural deformation model which then is used as regularization for non-rigid reconstruction in the second stage. The first stage learns the object's deformations such that it preserves consistency in novel views. The second stage obtains high reconstruction quality by optimizing 3D Gaussians that are driven by the coarse model. To this end we introduce a local 3D Gaussian representation where temporally shared Gaussians are anchored in and deformed by local oriented volumes. The resulting combined model can be rendered as radiance fields resulting in high-quality photo-realistic reconstructions of the non-rigidly deforming objects.

Previous methods improve fine-tuning performance by maintaining knowledge of the source datasets or introducing regularization terms such as contrastive loss.

In this paper we propose a simple method called adaptive random feature regularization (AdaRand). AdaRand helps the feature extractors of training models to adaptively change the distribution of feature vectors for downstream classification tasks without auxiliary source information and with reasonable computation costs. To this end AdaRand minimizes the gap between feature vectors and random reference vectors that are sampled from class conditional Gaussian distributions. Furthermore AdaRand dynamically updates the conditional distribution to follow the currently updated feature extractors and balance the distance between classes in feature spaces.

While existing models achieved certain progress in this task we believe the main bottleneck nowadays for further improvement is that we still cannot deal with hard cases well. Our framework aims to break through this bottleneck which includes two innovative components: an adaptive patch augmentation scheme and a hard-patch contrastive learning module. We first identify hard patches by computing the average entropy of each patch and then shield hard patches to prevent them from being cropped out while performing random patch cutmix. Such a scheme is able to prevent hard regions from being inadequately trained under strong augmentation. We further develop a new hard-patch contrastive learning algorithm to direct model attention to hard regions by applying extra contrast to pixels in hard patches further improving segmentation performance on hard cases. We demonstrate the superiority of our framework to state-of-the-art approaches on two famous BUS datasets achieving better performance under different labeling conditions.

    "abstract": "Despite substantial progress all-in-one image restoration (IR) grapples with persistent challenges in handling intricate real-world degradations. This paper introduces MPerceiver: a novel multimodal prompt learning approach that harnesses Stable Diffusion (SD) priors to enhance adaptiveness generalizability and fidelity for all-in-one image restoration. Specifically we develop a dual-branch module to master two types of SD prompts: textual for holistic representation and visual for multiscale detail representation. Both prompts are dynamically adjusted by degradation predictions from the CLIP image encoder enabling adaptive responses to diverse unknown degradations. Moreover a plug-in detail refinement module improves restoration fidelity via direct encoder-to-decoder information transformation. To assess our method MPerceiver is trained on 9 tasks for all-in-one IR and outperforms state-of-the-art task-specific methods across many tasks. Post multitask pre-training MPerceiver attains a generalized representation in low-level vision exhibiting remarkable zero-shot and few-shot capabilities in unseen tasks. Extensive experiments on 16 IR tasks underscore the superiority of MPerceiver in terms of adaptiveness generalizability and fidelity",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Event cameras have recently been shown beneficial for practical vision tasks such as action recognition thanks to their high temporal resolution power efficiency and reduced privacy concerns. However current research is hindered by 1) the difficulty in processing events because of their prolonged duration and dynamic actions with complex and ambiguous semantics and 2) the redundant action depiction of the event frame representation with fixed stacks. We find language naturally conveys abundant semantic information rendering it stunningly superior in reducing semantic uncertainty. In light of this we propose ExACT a novel approach that for the first time tackles event-based action recognition from a cross-modal conceptualizing perspective. Our ExACT brings two technical contributions. Firstly we propose an adaptive fine-grained event (AFE) representation to adaptively filter out the repeated events for the stationary objects while preserving dynamic ones. This subtly enhances the performance of ExACT without extra computational cost. Then we propose a conceptual reasoning-based uncertainty estimation module which simulates the recognition process to enrich the semantic representation. In particular conceptual reasoning builds the temporal relation based on the action semantics and uncertainty estimation tackles the semantic uncertainty of actions based on the distributional representation. Experiments show that our ExACT achieves superior recognition accuracy of 94.83%(+2.23%) 90.10%(+37.47%) and 67.24% on PAF HARDVS and our SeAct datasets respectively",

In this paper we propose a novel method to enhance images with both over- and under-exposures by learning to estimate and correct such color shifts. Specifically we first derive the color feature maps of the brightened and darkened versions of the input image via a UNet-based network followed by a pseudo-normal feature generator to produce pseudo-normal color feature maps. We then propose a novel COlor Shift Estimation (COSE) module to estimate the color shifts between the derived brightened (or darkened) color feature maps and the pseudo-normal color feature maps. The COSE module corrects the estimated color shifts of the over- and under-exposed regions separately. We further propose a novel COlor MOdulation (COMO) module to modulate the separately corrected colors in the over- and under-exposed regions to produce the enhanced image.

Hi-Mapper investigates the hierarchical organization of the visual scene by 1) pre-defining a hierarchy tree through the encapsulation of probability densities; and 2) learning the hierarchical relations in hyperbolic space with a novel hierarchical contrastive loss. The pre-defined hierarchy tree recursively interacts with the visual features of the pre-trained DNNs through hierarchy decomposition and encoding procedures thereby effectively identifying the visual hierarchy and enhancing the recognition of an entire scene.

In this paper we introduce a novel design principle termed ParameterNet aimed at augmenting the number of parameters in large-scale visual pretraining models while minimizing the increase in FLOPs. We leverage dynamic convolutions to incorporate additional parameters into the networks with only a marginal rise in FLOPs. The ParameterNet approach allows low-FLOPs networks to take advantage of large-scale visual pretraining. Furthermore we extend the ParameterNet concept to the language domain to enhance inference results while preserving inference speed. Experiments on the large-scale ImageNet-22K have shown the superiority of our ParameterNet scheme. For example ParameterNet-600M can achieve higher accuracy than the widely-used Swin Transformer (81.6% vs. 80.9%) and has much lower FLOPs (0.6G vs. 4.5G).

    "abstract": "Monocular depth estimation is a fundamental computer vision task. Recovering 3D depth from a single image is geometrically ill-posed and requires scene understanding so it is not surprising that the rise of deep learning has led to a breakthrough. The impressive progress of monocular depth estimators has mirrored the growth in model capacity from relatively modest CNNs to large Transformer architectures. Still monocular depth estimators tend to struggle when presented with images with unfamiliar content and layout since their knowledge of the visual world is restricted by the data seen during training and challenged by zero-shot generalization to new domains. This motivates us to explore whether the extensive priors captured in recent generative diffusion models can enable better more generalizable depth estimation. We introduce Marigold a method for affine-invariant monocular depth estimation that is derived from Stable Diffusion and retains its rich prior knowledge. The estimator can be fine-tuned in a couple of days on a single GPU using only synthetic training data.

    "abstract": "Recently 3D anomaly detection a crucial problem involving fine-grained geometry discrimination is getting more attention. However the lack of abundant real 3D anomaly data limits the scalability of current models. To enable scalable anomaly data collection we propose a 3D anomaly synthesis pipeline to adapt existing large-scale 3D models for 3D anomaly detection. Specifically we construct a synthetic dataset i.e. Anomaly-ShapeNet based on ShapeNet. Anomaly-ShapeNet consists of 1600 point cloud samples under 40 categories which provides a rich and varied collection of data enabling efficient training and enhancing adaptability to industrial scenarios. Meanwhile to enable scalable representation learning for 3D anomaly localization we propose a self-supervised method i.e. Iterative Mask Reconstruction Network (IMRNet). During training we propose a geometry-aware sample module to preserve potentially anomalous local regions during point cloud down-sampling. Then we randomly mask out point patches and sent the visible patches to a transformer for reconstruction-based self-supervision. During testing the point cloud repeatedly goes through the Mask Reconstruction Network with each iteration's output becoming the next input. By merging and contrasting the final reconstructed point cloud with the initial input our method successfully locates anomalies. Experiments show that IMRNet outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods achieving 66.1% in I-AUC on our Anomaly-ShapeNet dataset and 72.5% in I-AUC on Real3D-AD dataset.

Recent occupancy estimation techniques using only camera images as input can provide dense occupancy representations of large-scale scenes based on the current observation.

To extend camera-only occupancy estimation into spatiotemporal prediction we propose Cam4DOcc a new benchmark for camera-only 4D occupancy forecasting evaluating the surrounding scene changes in a near future. We build our benchmark based on multiple publicly available datasets including nuScenes nuScenes-Occupancy and Lyft-Level5 which provides sequential occupancy states of general movable and static objects as well as their 3D backward centripetal flow.

Furthermore the standardized evaluation protocol for preset multiple tasks is also provided to compare the performance of all the proposed baselines on present and future occupancy estimation with respect to objects of interest in autonomous driving scenarios.

Specifically 1) we first propose a Structure-Aware SDS that simultaneously optimizes human appearance and geometry. The multi-modal score function from both RGB and depth space is leveraged to distill the Gaussian densification and pruning process. 2) Moreover we devise an Annealed Negative Prompt Guidance by decomposing SDS into a noisier generative score and a cleaner classifier score which well addresses the over-saturation issue.

In this paper we propose the Decomposition-Integration Enhancing Multimodal Insight (DIEM) which initially decomposes the given question and image into multiple subquestions and several sub-images aiming to isolate specific elements for more focused analysis. We then integrate these sub-elements by matching each subquestion with its relevant sub-images while also retaining the original image to construct a comprehensive answer to the original question without losing sight of the overall context. This strategy mirrors the human cognitive process of simplifying complex problems into smaller components for individual analysis followed by an integration of these insights.

Experimental results indicate that our method boosts accuracy in most question classes of the ScienceQA (+2.03% in average) especially in the image modality (+3.40%). On MM-Vet our method achieves an improvement in MM-Vet scores increasing from 31.1 to 32.4.

Unlike current general-purpose foundation models that are stuck in the dilemma of inferior quality and text-image misalignment for humans CosmicMan enables generating photo-realistic human images with meticulous appearance reasonable structure and precise text-image alignment with detailed dense descriptions. At the heart of CosmicMan's success are the new reflections and perspectives on data and models: (1) We found that data quality and a scalable data production flow are essential for the final results from trained models. Hence we propose a new data production paradigm Annotate Anyone which serves as a perpetual data flywheel to produce high-quality data with accurate yet cost-effective annotations over time. Based on this we constructed a large-scale dataset CosmicMan-HQ 1.0 with 6 Million high-quality real-world human images in a mean resolution of 1488x1255 and attached with precise text annotations deriving from 115 Million attributes in diverse granularities. (2) We argue that a text-to-image foundation model specialized for humans must be pragmatic - easy to integrate into down-streaming tasks while effective in producing high-quality human images. Hence we propose to model the relationship between dense text descriptions and image pixels in a decomposed manner and present Decomposed-Attention-Refocusing (Daring) training framework. It seamlessly decomposes the cross-attention features in existing text-to-image diffusion model and enforces attention refocusing without adding extra modules. Through Daring we show that explicitly discretizing continuous text space into several basic groups that align with human body structure is the key to tackling the misalignment problem in a breeze.

Inspired by the strong translation capabilities of large language models (LLMs) that are trained on extensive multilingual text corpora we aim to harness off-the-shelf LLMs to handle SLT. In this paper we regularize the sign videos to embody linguistic characteristics of spoken language and propose a novel SignLLM framework to transform sign videos into a language-like representation for improved readability by off-the-shelf LLMs. SignLLM comprises two key modules: (1) The Vector-Quantized Visual Sign module converts sign videos into a sequence of discrete character-level sign tokens and (2) the Codebook Reconstruction and Alignment module converts these character-level tokens into word-level sign representations using an optimal transport formulation. A sign-text alignment loss further bridges the gap between sign and text tokens enhancing semantic compatibility. We achieve state-of-the-art gloss-free results on two widely-used SLT benchmarks",

    "abstract": "No-reference point cloud quality assessment (NR-PCQA) aims to automatically evaluate the perceptual quality of distorted point clouds without available reference which have achieved tremendous improvements due to the utilization of deep neural networks. However learning-based NR-PCQA methods suffer from the scarcity of labeled data and usually perform suboptimally in terms of generalization. To solve the problem we propose a novel contrastive pre-training framework tailored for PCQA (CoPA) which enables the pre-trained model to learn quality-aware representations from unlabeled data. To obtain anchors in the representation space we project point clouds with different distortions into images and randomly mix their local patches to form mixed images with multiple distortions. Utilizing the generated anchors we constrain the pre-training process via a quality-aware contrastive loss following the philosophy that perceptual quality is closely related to both content and distortion. Furthermore in the model fine-tuning stage we propose a semantic-guided multi-view fusion module to effectively integrate the features of projected images from multiple perspectives. Extensive experiments show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art PCQA methods on popular benchmarks. Further investigations demonstrate that CoPA can also benefit existing learning-based PCQA models",

    "abstract": "Active Domain Adaptation (ADA) aims to maximally boost model adaptation in a new target domain by actively selecting a limited number of target data to annotate. This setting neglects the more practical scenario where training data are collected from multiple sources. This motivates us to extend ADA from a single source domain to multiple source domains termed Multi-source Active Domain Adaptation (MADA). Not surprisingly we find that most traditional ADA methods cannot work directly in such a setting mainly due to the excessive domain gap introduced by all the source domains. Considering this we propose a Detective framework that comprehensively considers the domain shift between multi-source domains and target domains to detect the informative target samples. Specifically the Detective leverages a dynamic Domain Adaptation (DA) model that learns how to adapt the model's parameters to fit the union of multi-source domains. This enables an approximate single-source domain modeling by the dynamic model. We then comprehensively measure both domain uncertainty and predictive uncertainty in the target domain to detect informative target samples using evidential deep learning thereby mitigating uncertainty miscalibration.

    "abstract": "Lifelong Person Re-identification (L-ReID) aims to learn from sequentially collected data to match a person across different scenes. Once an L-ReID model is updated using new data all historical images in the gallery are required to be re-calculated to obtain new features for testing known as \"re-indexing\". However it is infeasible when raw images in the gallery are unavailable due to data privacy concerns resulting in incompatible retrieval between the query and the gallery features calculated by different models which causes significant performance degradation. In this paper we focus on a new task called Re-indexing Free Lifelong Person Re-identification (RFL-ReID) which requires achieving effective L-ReID without re-indexing raw images in the gallery. To this end we propose a Continual Compatible Representation (C2R) method which facilitates the query feature calculated by the continuously updated model to effectively retrieve the gallery feature calculated by the old model in a compatible manner. Specifically we design a Continual Compatible Transfer (CCT) network to continuously transfer and consolidate the old gallery feature into the new feature space. Besides a Balanced Compatible Distillation module is introduced to achieve compatibility by aligning the transferred feature space with the new feature space. Finally a Balanced Anti-forgetting Distillation module is proposed to eliminate the accumulated forgetting of old knowledge during the continual compatible transfer. Extensive experiments on several benchmark L-ReID datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method against state-of-the-art methods for both RFL-ReID and L-ReID tasks.

The previous methods have validated the effectiveness of information fusion in the Fourier space of the whole image.

To this end we propose a Hierarchical Frequency Integration Network (HFIN) to facilitate hierarchical Fourier information integration for pan-sharpening. Specifically our network consists of two designs: information stratification and information integration. For information stratification we hierarchically decompose PAN and LRMS information into spatial global Fourier and local Fourier information and fuse them independently. For information integration the above hierarchical fused information is processed to further enhance their relationships and undergo comprehensive integration. Our method extend a new space for exploring the relationships of PAN and LRMS images enhancing the integration of spatial-frequency information. Extensive experiments robustly validate the effectiveness of the proposed network showcasing its superior performance compared to other state-of-the-art methods and generalization in real-world scenes and other fusion tasks as a general image fusion framework.

Thus using bounding boxes (bboxes) as annotations has shown great potential.

However due to the presence of intersections among bboxes not every point has a determined instance label especially in overlapping areas. To generate higher quality pseudo-labels and achieve more precise weakly supervised 3DIS results we propose the Box-Supervised Simulation-assisted Mean Teacher for 3D Instance Segmentation (BSNet) which devises a novel pseudo-labeler called Simulation-assisted Transformer. The labeler consists of two main components. The first is Simulation-assisted Mean Teacher which introduces Mean Teacher for the first time in this task and constructs simulated samples to assist the labeler in acquiring prior knowledge about overlapping areas. To better model local-global structure we also propose Local-Global Aware Attention as the decoder for teacher and student labelers.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Object-centric learning (OCL) extracts the representation of objects with slots offering an exceptional blend of flexibility and interpretability for abstracting low-level perceptual features. A widely adopted method within OCL is slot attention which utilizes attention mechanisms to iteratively refine slot representations. However a major drawback of most object-centric models including slot attention is their reliance on predefining the number of slots. This not only necessitates prior knowledge of the dataset but also overlooks the inherent variability in the number of objects present in each instance. To overcome this fundamental limitation we present a novel complexity-aware object auto-encoder framework. Within this framework we introduce an adaptive slot attention (AdaSlot) mechanism that dynamically determines the optimal number of slots based on the content of the data. This is achieved by proposing a discrete slot sampling module that is responsible for selecting an appropriate number of slots from a candidate list. Furthermore we introduce a masked slot decoder that suppresses unselected slots during the decoding process. Our framework tested extensively on object discovery tasks with various datasets shows performance matching or exceeding top fixed-slot models. Moreover our analysis substantiates that our method exhibits the capability to dynamically adapt the slot number according to each instance's complexity offering the potential for further exploration in slot attention research.

Moreover through backtracking from the most prominent predictions CORES effectively pinpoints sample-relevant kernels across different layers.

To address this we introduce a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) wherein the convolutional filters are strictly constrained to be wavelets. This allows the filters to update to task-optimized wavelets during the training procedure. Our primary contribution lies in the rigorous formulation of these filters via a constrained empirical risk minimization framework thereby providing an exact mechanism to enforce these structural constraints.

However fall short in achieving precise user control often yielding results that do not align with user expectations thus limiting their applicability. User-envisioning 3D object generation faces significant challenges in realizing its concepts using current generative models due to limited interaction capabilities. Existing methods mainly offer two approaches: (i) interpreting textual instructions with constrained controllability or (ii) reconstructing 3D objects from 2D images. Both of them limit customization to the confines of the 2D reference and potentially introduce undesirable artifacts during the 3D lifting process restricting the scope for direct and versatile 3D modifications. In this work we introduce Interactive3D an innovative framework for interactive 3D generation that grants users precise control over the generative process through extensive 3D interaction capabilities. Interactive3D is constructed in two cascading stages utilizing distinct 3D representations. The first stage employs Gaussian Splatting for direct user interaction allowing modifications and guidance of the generative direction at any intermediate step through (i) Adding and Removing components (ii) Deformable and Rigid Dragging (iii) Geometric Transformations and (iv) Semantic Editing. Subsequently the Gaussian splats are transformed into InstantNGP. We introduce a novel (v) Interactive Hash Refinement module to further add details and extract the geometry in the second stage.

    "abstract": "Vision Transformer (ViT) has emerged as a prominent architecture for various computer vision tasks. In ViT we divide the input image into patch tokens and process them through a stack of self-attention blocks. However unlike Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) ViT's simple architecture has no informative inductive bias (e.g. locality etc.). Due to this ViT requires a large amount of data for pre-training. Various data-efficient approaches (DeiT) have been proposed to train ViT on balanced datasets effectively. However limited literature discusses the use of ViT for datasets with long-tailed imbalances. In this work we introduce DeiT-LT to tackle the problem of training ViTs from scratch on long-tailed datasets. In DeiT-LT we introduce an efficient and effective way of distillation from CNN via distillation \\texttt DIST token by using out-of-distribution images and re-weighting the distillation loss to enhance focus on tail classes. This leads to the learning of local CNN-like features in early ViT blocks improving generalization for tail classes. Further to mitigate overfitting we propose distilling from a flat CNN teacher which leads to learning low-rank generalizable features for DIST tokens across all ViT blocks. With the proposed DeiT-LT scheme the distillation DIST token becomes an expert on the tail classes and the classifier CLS token becomes an expert on the head classes. The experts help to effectively learn features corresponding to both the majority and minority classes using a distinct set of tokens within the same ViT architecture. We show the effectiveness of DeiT-LT for training ViT from scratch on datasets ranging from small-scale CIFAR-10 LT to large-scale iNaturalist-2018.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Non-Exemplar Class Incremental Learning (NECIL) involves learning a classification model on a sequence of data without access to exemplars from previously encountered old classes. Such a stringent constraint always leads to catastrophic forgetting of the learned knowledge. Currently existing methods either employ knowledge distillation techniques or preserved class prototypes to sustain prior knowledge. However two critical issues still persist. On the one hand as the model is continually updated the preserved prototypes of old classes will inevitably derive from the suitable location in the feature space of the new model. On the other hand due to the lack of exemplars the features of new classes will take the place of similar old classes which breaks the classification boundary. To address these challenges we propose a Feature Calibration and Separation (FCS) method for NECIL. Our approach comprises a Feature Calibration Network (FCN) that adapts prototypes of old classes to the new model via optimal transport learning approximating the drift of prototypes caused by model evolution. Additionally we also propose a Prototype-Involved Contrastive Loss (PIC) that enhances feature separation among different classes. Specifically to mitigate the boundary distortion arising from the interplay of classes from different learning stages prototypes are involved in pushing the feature of new classes away from the old classes. Extensive experiments on three datasets with different settings have demonstrated the superiority of our FCS method against the state-of-the-art class incremental learning approaches.

However many relationships such as containment and transferability are naturally asymmetric and current approaches for representation and visualization (e.g. t-SNE) do not readily support this. We propose Task2Box an approach to represent tasks using box embeddings---axis-aligned hyperrectangles in low dimensional spaces---that can capture asymmetric relationships between them through volumetric overlaps. We show that Task2Box accurately predicts unseen hierarchical relationships between nodes in ImageNet and iNaturalist datasets as well as transferability between tasks in the Taskonomy benchmark. We also show that box embeddings estimated from task representations (e.g. CLIP Task2Vec or attribute based) can be used to predict relationships between unseen tasks more accurately than classifiers trained on the same representations as well as handcrafted asymmetric distances (e.g. KL divergence). This suggests that low-dimensional box embeddings can effectively capture these task relationships and have the added advantage of being interpretable. We use the approach to visualize relationships among publicly available image classification datasets on popular dataset hosting platform called Hugging Face",

    "abstract": "In this paper we present a novel indoor 3D reconstruction method with occluded surface completion given a sequence of depth readings. Prior state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods only focus on the reconstruction of the visible areas in a scene neglecting the invisible areas due to the occlusions e.g. the contact surface between furniture occluded wall and floor. Our method tackles the task of completing the occluded scene surfaces resulting in a complete 3D scene mesh. The core idea of our method is learning 3D geometry prior from various complete scenes to infer the occluded geometry of an unseen scene from solely depth measurements. We design a coarse-fine hierarchical octree representation coupled with a dual-decoder architecture i.e. Geo-decoder and 3D Inpainter which jointly reconstructs the complete 3D scene geometry. The Geo-decoder with detailed representation at fine levels is optimized online for each scene to reconstruct visible surfaces. The 3D Inpainter with abstract representation at coarse levels is trained offline using various scenes to complete occluded surfaces. As a result while the Geo-decoder is specialized for an individual scene the 3D Inpainter can be generally applied across different scenes. We evaluate the proposed method on the 3D Completed Room Scene (3D-CRS) and iTHOR datasets significantly outperforming the SOTA methods by a gain of 16.8% and 24.2% in terms of the completeness of 3D reconstruction. 3D-CRS dataset including a complete 3D mesh of each scene is provided at project webpage",

In this paper we introduce a new approach called Omnidirectional Local Radiance Fields (OmniLocalRF) that can render static-only scene views removing and inpainting dynamic objects simultaneously. Our approach combines the principles of local radiance fields with the bidirectional optimization of omnidirectional rays. Our input is an omnidirectional video and we evaluate the mutual observations of the entire angle between the previous and current frames. To reduce ghosting artifacts of dynamic objects and inpaint occlusions we devise a multi-resolution motion mask prediction module. Unlike existing methods that primarily separate dynamic components through the temporal domain our method uses multi-resolution neural feature planes for precise segmentation which is more suitable for long 360-degree videos. Our experiments validate that OmniLocalRF outperforms existing methods in both qualitative and quantitative metrics especially in scenarios with complex real-world scenes. In particular our approach eliminates the need for manual interaction such as drawing motion masks by hand and additional pose estimation making it a highly effective and efficient solution",

SHERT applies semantic- and normal-based sampling between the detailed surface (e.g. mesh and SDF) and the corresponding SMPL-X model to obtain a partially sampled semantic mesh and then generates the complete semantic mesh by our specifically designed self-supervised completion and refinement networks. Using the complete semantic mesh as a basis we employ a texture diffusion model to create human textures that are driven by both images and texts. Our reconstructed meshes have stable UV unwrapping high-quality triangle meshes and consistent semantic information. The given SMPL-X model provides semantic information and shape priors allowing SHERT to perform well even with incorrect and incomplete inputs. The semantic information also makes it easy to substitute and animate different body parts such as the face body and hands.

    "abstract": "Federated learning facilitates the collaborative learning of a global model across multiple distributed medical institutions without centralizing data. Nevertheless the expensive cost of annotation on local clients remains an obstacle to effectively utilizing local data. To mitigate this issue federated active learning methods suggest leveraging local and global model predictions to select a relatively small amount of informative local data for annotation. However existing methods mainly focus on all local data sampled from the same domain making them unreliable in realistic medical scenarios with domain shifts among different clients. In this paper we make the first attempt to assess the informativeness of local data derived from diverse domains and propose a novel methodology termed Federated Evidential Active Learning (FEAL) to calibrate the data evaluation under domain shift. Specifically we introduce a Dirichlet prior distribution in both local and global models to treat the prediction as a distribution over the probability simplex and capture both aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties by using the Dirichlet-based evidential model. Then we employ the epistemic uncertainty to calibrate the aleatoric uncertainty. Afterward we design a diversity relaxation strategy to reduce data redundancy and maintain data diversity. Extensive experiments and analysis on five real multi-center medical image datasets demonstrate the superiority of FEAL over the state-of-the-art active learning methods in federated scenarios with domain shifts.

This module leverages the affinity hint to transfer appearance information from the condition frame to individual frames in the latent space. This design mitigates the challenges of appearance-related frame alignment within PIA and allows for a stronger focus on aligning with motion-related guidance.

Recently progress has been made in image reconstruction with non-invasive brain recordings but it's still difficult to generate realistic images with high semantic fidelity due to the scarcity of data annotations. Unlike previous methods this work casts the neural decoding into optimal transport (OT) and representation decoupling problems. Specifically under discrete OT theory we design a graph matching-guided neural representation learning framework to seek the underlying correspondences between conceptual semantics and neural signals which yields a natural and meaningful self-supervisory task. Moreover the proposed MindArt structured with multiple stand-alone modal branches enables the seamless incorporation of semantic representation into any visual style information thus leaving it to have multi-modal reconstruction and training-free semantic editing capabilities. By doing so the reconstructed images of MindArt have phenomenal realism both in terms of semantics and appearance. We compare our MindArt with leading alternatives and achieve SOTA performance in different decoding tasks. Importantly our approach can directly generate a series of stylized \"mind snapshots\" w/o extra optimizations which may open up more potential applications.

The VLMs provide stronger and more generalizable feature embeddings compared to those from ImageNet-pretrained models thanks to the training on the large-scale Internet image-text pairs. However despite the amazing achievement from the VLMs vanilla Vision Transformers (ViTs) remain the default choice for the image encoder. Although pure transformer proves its effectiveness in the text encoding area it remains questionable whether it is also the case for image encoding especially considering that various types of networks are proposed on the ImageNet benchmark which unfortunately are rarely studied in VLMs. Due to small data/model scale the original conclusions of model design on ImageNet can be limited and biased. In this paper we aim at building an evaluation protocol of vision models in the vision-language era under the contrastive language-image pretraining (CLIP) framework. We provide a comprehensive way to benchmark different vision models covering their zero-shot performance and scalability in both model and training data sizes. To this end we introduce ViTamin a new vision models tailored for VLMs. ViTamin-L significantly outperforms ViT-L by 2.0% ImageNet zero-shot accuracy when using the same publicly available DataComp-1B dataset and the same OpenCLIP training scheme. ViTamin-L presents promising results on 60 diverse benchmarks including classification retrieval open-vocabulary detection and segmentation and large multi-modal models.

However we show both theoretically and empirically that such spatial proximity based contrastive loss significantly disrupts hierarchies in the latent space. To remedy this we advocate that the cross-modal representations should accept the inherent modality gap between text and images and introduce a novel approach to measure cross-modal similarity that does not enforce spatial proximity. Our approach show remarkable capabilities in preserving unimodal hierarchies while aligning the two modalities.

However these requirements are only partially addressed by current methods with training sets containing biased audio-visual data and models that generalise poorly beyond this biased training set.

Second Large Language Model (LLM) is employed for contextualized few-shot learning with the input of all classes and query image proposals. Language instructions are carefully designed to prompt the LLM to classify each proposal in context. The contextual information include proposal-proposal relations proposal-class relations and class-class relations which can largely promote few-shot learning. We comprehensively evaluate the proposed model (FM-FSOD) in multiple FSOD benchmarks achieving state-of-the-arts performance",

    "abstract": "Federated learning (FL) promotes decentralized training while prioritizing data confidentiality. However its application on resource-constrained devices is challenging due to the high demand for computation and memory resources to train deep learning models. Neural network pruning techniques such as dynamic pruning could enhance model efficiency but directly adopting them in FL still poses substantial challenges including post-pruning performance degradation high activation memory usage etc. To address these challenges we propose FedMef a novel and memory-efficient federated dynamic pruning framework. FedMef comprises two key components. First we introduce the budget-aware extrusion that maintains pruning efficiency while preserving post-pruning performance by salvaging crucial information from parameters marked for pruning within a given budget. Second we propose scaled activation pruning to effectively reduce activation memory footprints which is particularly beneficial for deploying FL to memory-limited devices. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed FedMef. In particular it achieves a significant reduction of 28.5% in memory footprint compared to state-of-the-art methods while obtaining superior accuracy",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Computer vision tasks typically involve describing what is visible in an image (e.g. classification detection segmentation and captioning). We study a visual common sense task that requires understanding 'what is not visible'. Specifically given an image (e.g. of a living room) and a name of an object (\"cushion\") a vision system is asked to predict semantically-meaningful regions (masks or bounding boxes) in the image where that object could be placed or is likely be placed by humans (e.g. on the sofa). We call this task: Semantic Placement (SP) and believe that such common-sense visual understanding is critical for assitive robots (tidying a house) AR devices (automatically rendering an object in the user's space) and visually-grounded chatbots with common sense. Studying the invisible is hard. Datasets for image description are typically constructed by curating relevant images (e.g. via image search with object names) and asking humans to annotate the contents of the image; neither of those two steps are straightforward for objects not present in the image. We overcome this challenge by operating in the opposite direction: we start with an image of an object in context (which is easy to find online) and remove that object from the image via inpainting. This automated pipeline converts unstructured web data into a paired with/without object dataset. With this proposed data generation pipeline we collect a novel dataset containing 1.3M images across 9 object categories. We then train a SP prediction model called CLIP-UNet on our dataset. The CLIP-UNet outperforms existing VLMs and baselines that combine semantic priors with object detectors generalizes well to real-world and simulated images exhibits semantics-aware reasoning for object placement and enables downstream applications like tidying robots in indoor environments",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Image-based virtual try-on is an increasingly important task for online shopping. It aims to synthesize images of a specific person wearing a specified garment. Diffusion model-based approaches have recently become popular as they are excellent at image synthesis tasks. However these approaches usually employ additional image encoders and rely on the cross-attention mechanism for texture transfer from the garment to the person image which affects the try-on's efficiency and fidelity. To address these issues we propose an Texture-Preserving Diffusion (TPD) model for virtual try-on which enhances the fidelity of the results and introduces no additional image encoders. Accordingly we make contributions from two aspects. First we propose to concatenate the masked person and reference garment images along the spatial dimension and utilize the resulting image as the input for the diffusion model's denoising UNet. This enables the original self-attention layers contained in the diffusion model to achieve efficient and accurate texture transfer. Second we propose a novel diffusion-based method that predicts a precise inpainting mask based on the person and reference garment images further enhancing the reliability of the try-on results. In addition we integrate mask prediction and image synthesis into a single compact model. The experimental results show that our approach can be applied to various try-on tasks e.g. garment-to-person and person-to-person try-ons and significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on popular VITON VITON-HD databases.

Nevertheless there exists unseen classes from target domains in practical scenarios. To address this issue Open Set Domain Generalization (OSDG) has emerged and several methods have been exclusively proposed. However most existing methods adopt complex architectures with slight improvement compared with DG methods. Recently vision-language models (VLMs) have been introduced in DG following the fine-tuning paradigm but consume huge training overhead with large vision models. Therefore in this paper we innovate to transfer knowledge from VLMs to lightweight vision models and improve the robustness by introducing Perturbation Distillation (PD) from three perspectives including Score Class and Instance (SCI) named SCI-PD. Moreover previous methods are oriented by the benchmarks with identical and fixed splits ignoring the divergence between source domains. These methods are revealed to suffer from sharp performance decay with our proposed new benchmark Hybrid Domain Generalization (HDG) and a novel metric H^ 2 -CV which construct various splits to comprehensively assess the robustness of algorithms.

Further investigation reveals the disentangled nature of its emergent latent space that serves as an effective interface to control and manipulate the produced images.

    "abstract": "Event camera has recently received much attention for low-light image enhancement (LIE) thanks to their distinct advantages such as high dynamic range. However current research is prohibitively restricted by the lack of large-scale real-world and spatial-temporally aligned event-image datasets. To this end we propose a real-world (indoor and outdoor) dataset comprising over 30K pairs of images and events under both low and normal illumination conditions. To achieve this we utilize a robotic arm that traces a consistent non-linear trajectory to curate the dataset with spatial alignment precision under 0.03mm. We then introduce a matching alignment strategy rendering 90% of our dataset with errors less than 0.01s. Based on the dataset we propose a novel event-guided LIE approach called EvLight towards robust performance in real-world low-light scenes. Specifically we first design the multi-scale holistic fusion branch to extract holistic structural and textural information from both events and images. To ensure robustness against variations in the regional illumination and noise we then introduce a Signal-to-Noise-Ratio (SNR)-guided regional feature selection to selectively fuse features of images from regions with high SNR and enhance those with low SNR by extracting regional structural information from events. our EvLight significantly surpasses the frame-based methods e.g. Retinexformer by 1.14 dB and 2.62 dB respectively.

Current approaches are highly sensitive to data usage during training and illumination-specific hyper-parameters limiting their ability to handle unseen scenarios. In this paper we propose a new zero-reference low-light enhancement framework trainable solely with normal light images. To accomplish this we devise an illumination-invariant prior inspired by the theory of physical light transfer. This prior serves as the bridge between normal and low-light images. Then we develop a prior-to-image framework trained without low-light data. During testing this framework is able to restore our illumination-invariant prior back to images automatically achieving low-light enhancement. Within this framework we leverage a pretrained generative diffusion model for model ability introduce a bypass decoder to handle detail distortion as well as offer a lightweight version for practicality.

Specifically the LLaMA-Excitor does not directly change the intermediate hidden state during the self-attention calculation of the transformer structure. We designed the Excitor block as a bypass module for the similarity score computation in LLMs' self-attention to reconstruct keys and change the importance of values by learnable prompts. LLaMA-Excitor ensures a self-adaptive allocation of additional attention to input instructions thus effectively preserving LLMs' pre-trained knowledge when fine-tuning LLMs on low-quality instruction-following datasets. Furthermore we unify the modeling of multi-modal tuning and language-only tuning extending LLaMA-Excitor to a powerful visual instruction follower without the need for complex multi-modal alignment. Our proposed approach is evaluated in language-only and multi-modal tuning experimental scenarios. Notably LLaMA-Excitor is the only method that maintains basic capabilities while achieving a significant improvement (+6%) on the MMLU benchmark.

Since training a non-linear transform directly on a large scale of NeRF feature planes is impractical we discover that pre-trained neural 2D image codec can be utilized for compressing the features when adding content-specific parameters. Specifically we reuse neural 2D image codec but modify its encoder and decoder heads while keeping the other parts of the pre-trained decoder frozen. This allows us to train the full pipeline via supervision of rendering loss and entropy loss yielding the rate-distortion balance by updating the content-specific parameters.

In this work we intend to incorporate generative diffusion techniques for computing the surrogate dataset. Observing that key factors for constructing an effective surrogate dataset are representativeness and diversity we design additional minimax criteria in the generative training to enhance these facets for the generated images of diffusion models. We present a theoretical model of the process as hierarchical diffusion control demonstrating the flexibility of the diffusion process to target these criteria without jeopardizing the faithfulness of the sample to the desired distribution. The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art validation performance while demanding much less computational resources.

Unlike generation editing requires a balance between conforming to the target attribute and preserving the identity of the source content. Recent 2D image editing methods have achieved this balance by leveraging the stochastic latent encoded in the generative process of diffusion models. To extend the editing capabilities of diffusion models shown in pixel space to parameter space we reformulate the 2D image editing method into an optimization form named PDS. PDS matches the stochastic latents of the source and the target enabling the sampling of targets in diverse parameter spaces that align with a desired attribute while maintaining the source's identity. We demonstrate that this optimization resembles running a generative process with the target attribute but aligning this process with the trajectory of the source's generative process. Extensive editing results in Neural Radiance Fields and Scalable Vector Graphics representations demonstrate that PDS is capable of sampling targets to fulfill the aforementioned balance across various parameter spaces",

Jointly estimating the 3D poses of a hand and the object it manipulates from a monocular camera is challenging due to frequent occlusions. Thus existing methods often rely on intermediate 3D shape representations to increase performance. These representations are typically explicit such as 3D point clouds or meshes and thus provide information in the direct surroundings of the intermediate hand pose estimate. To address this we introduce HOISDF a Signed Distance Field (SDF) guided hand-object pose estimation network which jointly exploits hand and object SDFs to provide a global implicit representation over the complete reconstruction volume. Specifically the role of the SDFs is threefold: equip the visual encoder with implicit shape information help to encode hand-object interactions and guide the hand and object pose regression via SDF-based sampling and by augmenting the feature representations.

We show through extensive experiments that for alignment to be effective the resampling should preserve the reference frequency spectrum while minimizing spatial distortions. However most existing works simply use a default choice of bilinear interpolation for resampling even though bilinear interpolation has a smoothing effect and hinders super-resolution. From these observations we propose an implicit resampling-based alignment. The sampling positions are encoded by a sinusoidal positional encoding while the value is estimated with a coordinate network and a window-based cross-attention. We show that bilinear interpolation inherently attenuates high-frequency information while an MLP-based coordinate network can approximate more frequencies. Experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets show that alignment with our proposed implicit resampling enhances the performance of state-of-the-art frameworks with minimal impact on both compute and parameters",

In lieu of time-consuming optimization and fine-tuning our zero-shot method generalizes well to arbitrary face portraits with unposed camera views extreme facial expressions and diverse artistic depictions. At its core we leverage the generative prior of 2D diffusion models pre-trained on large-scale image datasets as our rendering backbone while the denoising is guided with disentangled attentive control of appearance and camera pose. To achieve this we first inject the appearance context from the reference image into the self-attention layers of the frozen UNets. The rendering view is then manipulated with a novel conditional control module that interprets the camera pose by watching a condition image of a crossed subject from the same view. Furthermore we insert a trainable cross-view attention module to enhance view consistency which is further strengthened with a novel 3D-aware noise generation process during inference. We demonstrate state-of-the-art results both qualitatively and quantitatively on our challenging in-the-wild and multi-view benchmarks",

Such pre-training techniques have also been explored recently in the remote sensing domain due to the availability of large amount of unlabelled data. Different from standard natural image datasets remote sensing data is acquired from various sensor technologies and exhibit diverse range of scale variations as well as modalities. Existing satellite image pre-training methods either ignore the scale information present in the remote sensing imagery or restrict themselves to use only a single type of data modality. In this paper we re-visit transformers pre-training and leverage multi-scale information that is effectively utilized with multiple modalities. Our proposed approach named SatMAE++ performs multi-scale pre-training and utilizes convolution based upsampling blocks to reconstruct the image at higher scales making it extensible to include more scales. Compared to existing works the proposed SatMAE++ with multi-scale pre-training is equally effective for both optical as well as multi-spectral imagery. Extensive experiments on six datasets reveal the merits of proposed contributions leading to state-of-the-art performance on all datasets.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Weakly-Supervised Scene Graph Generation (WSSGG) research has recently emerged as an alternative to the fully-supervised approach that heavily relies on costly annotations. In this regard studies on WSSGG have utilized image captions to obtain unlocalized triplets while primarily focusing on grounding the unlocalized triplets over image regions. However they have overlooked the two issues involved in the triplet formation process from the captions: 1) Semantic over-simplification issue arises when extracting triplets from captions where fine-grained predicates in captions are undesirably converted into coarse-grained predicates resulting in a long-tailed predicate distribution and 2) Low-density scene graph issue arises when aligning the triplets in the caption with entity/predicate classes of interest where many triplets are discarded and not used in training leading to insufficient supervision. To tackle the two issues we propose a new approach i.e. Large Language Model for weakly-supervised SGG (LLM4SGG) where we mitigate the two issues by leveraging the LLM's in-depth understanding of language and reasoning ability during the extraction of triplets from captions and alignment of entity/predicate classes with target data. To further engage the LLM in these processes we adopt the idea of Chain-of-Thought and the in-context few-shot learning strategy. To validate the effectiveness of LLM4SGG we conduct extensive experiments on Visual Genome and GQA datasets showing significant improvements in both Recall@K and mean Recall@K compared to the state-of-the-art WSSGG methods. A further appeal is that LLM4SGG is data-efficient enabling effective model training with a small amount of training images",

    "abstract": "Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) is an effective methodology to unleash the potential of large foundation models in novel scenarios with limited training data. In the computer vision community PEFT has shown effectiveness in image classification but little research has studied its ability for image segmentation. Fine-tuning segmentation models usually require a heavier adjustment of parameters to align the proper projection directions in the parameter space for new scenarios. This raises a challenge to existing PEFT algorithms as they often inject a limited number of individual parameters into each block which prevents substantial adjustment of the projection direction of the parameter space due to the limitation of Hidden Markov Chain along blocks. In this paper we equip PEFT with a cross-block orchestration mechanism to enable the adaptation of the Segment Anything Model (SAM) to various downstream scenarios. We introduce a novel inter-block communication module which integrates a learnable relation matrix to facilitate communication among different coefficient sets of each PEFT block's parameter space. Moreover we propose an intra-block enhancement module which introduces a linear projection head whose weights are generated from a hyper-complex layer further enhancing the impact of the adjustment of projection directions on the entire parameter space. Extensive experiments on diverse benchmarks demonstrate that our proposed approach consistently improves the segmentation performance significantly on novel scenarios with only around 1K additional parameters",

In this paper we present Neural Directional Encoding (NDE) a view-dependent appearance encoding of neural radiance fields (NeRF) for rendering specular objects. NDE transfers the concept of feature-grid-based spatial encoding to the angular domain significantly improving the ability to model high-frequency angular signals. In contrast to previous methods that use encoding functions with only angular input we additionally cone-trace spatial features to obtain a spatially varying directional encoding which addresses the challenging interreflection effects. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real datasets show that a NeRF model with NDE (1) outperforms the state of the art on view synthesis of specular objects and (2) works with small networks to allow fast (real-time) inference.

In this paper we introduce Open-Set Domain Adaptation for Semantic Segmentation (OSDA-SS) for the first time where the target domain includes unknown classes. We identify two major problems in the OSDA-SS scenario as follows: 1) the existing UDA methods struggle to predict the exact boundary of the unknown classes and 2) they fail to accurately predict the shape of the unknown classes. To address these issues we propose Boundary and Unknown Shape-Aware open-set domain adaptation coined BUS. Our BUS can accurately discern the boundaries between known and unknown classes in a contrastive manner using a novel dilation-erosion-based contrastive loss. In addition we propose OpenReMix a new domain mixing augmentation method that guides our model to effectively learn domain and size-invariant features for improving the shape detection of the known and unknown classes.

As a Hierarchical Vision Transformer (H-ViT) we propose a dual self-attention and cross-attention mechanism that uses high-level features in the deformation field to represent low-level ones enabling information streams in the deformation field across all voxel patch embeddings irrespective of their spatial proximity. Since high-level features contain abstract flow patterns such patterns are expected to effectively contribute to the representation of the deformation field in lower scales. When the self-attention module utilizes within-scale short-range patterns for representation the cross-attention modules dynamically look for the key tokens across different scales to further interact with the local query voxel patches.

To bridge this gap we introduce a Synergistic High-order Interaction Paradigm (SHIP) designed to systematically investigate spatial fine-grained and global statistics collaborations between infrared and visible images across two fundamental dimensions: 1) Spatial dimension: we construct spatial fine-grained interactions through element-wise multiplication mathematically equivalent to global interactions and then foster high-order formats by iteratively aggregating and evolving complementary information enhancing both efficiency and flexibility. 2) Channel dimension: expanding on channel interactions with first-order statistics (mean) we devise high-order channel interactions to facilitate the discernment of inter-dependencies between source images based on global statistics.

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have been enhanced with vision capabilities enabling them to comprehend images videos and interleaved vision-language content. However the learning methods of these large multimodal models (LMMs) typically treat videos as predetermined clips rendering them less effective and efficient at handling streaming video inputs. In this paper we propose a novel Learning-In-Video-Stream (LIVE) framework which enables temporally aligned long-context and real-time dialogue within a continuous video stream. Our LIVE framework comprises comprehensive approaches to achieve video streaming dialogue encompassing: (1) a training objective designed to perform language modeling for continuous streaming inputs (2) a data generation scheme that converts offline temporal annotations into a streaming dialogue format and (3) an optimized inference pipeline to speed up interactive chat in real-world video streams. With our LIVE framework we develop a simplified model called VideoLLM-online and demonstrate its significant advantages in processing streaming videos. For instance our VideoLLM-online-7B model can operate at over 10 FPS on an A100 GPU for a 5-minute video clip from Ego4D narration. Moreover VideoLLM-online also showcases state-of-the-art performance on public offline video benchmarks such as recognition captioning and forecasting.

    "abstract": "With the advent of generative models and vision language pretraining significant improvement has been made in text-driven face manipulation. The text embedding can be used as target supervision for expression control.However it is non-trivial to associate with its 3D attributesi.e. pose and illumination. To address these issues we propose a Text-conditional Attribute aLignment approach for 3D controllable face image synthesis and our model is referred to as TcALign. Specifically since the 3D rendered image can be precisely controlled with the 3D face representation we first propose a Text-conditional 3D Editor to produce the target face representation to realize text-driven manipulation in the 3D space. An attribute embedding space spanned by the target-related attributes embeddings is also introduced to infer the disentangled task-specific direction. Next we train a cross-modal latent mapping network conditioned on the derived difference of 3D representation to infer a correct vector in the latent space of StyleGAN.Thiscorrection vector learning design can accurately transfer the attribute manipulation on 3D images to 2D images. We show that the proposed method delivers more precise text-driven multi-attribute manipulation for 3D controllable face image synthesis.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "In this paper we tackle the task of category-agnostic pose estimation (CAPE) which aims to predict poses for objects of any category with few annotated samples. Previous works either rely on local matching between features of support and query samples or require support keypoint identifier. The former is prone to overfitting due to its sensitivity to sparse samples while the latter is impractical for the open-world nature of the task. To overcome these limitations we propose ESCAPE - a Bayesian framework that learns a prior over the features of keypoints. The prior can be expressed as a mixture of super-keypoints each being a high-level abstract keypoint that captures the statistics of semantically related keypoints from different categories. We estimate the super-keypoints from base categories and use them in adaptation to novel categories. The adaptation to an unseen category involves two steps: first we match each novel keypoint to a related super-keypoint; and second we transfer the knowledge encoded in the matched super-keypoints to the novel keypoints. For the first step we propose a learnable matching network to capture the relationship between the novel keypoints and the super-keypoints resulting in a more reliable matching. ESCAPE mitigates overfitting by directly transferring learned knowledge to novel categories while it does not use keypoint identifiers.

    "abstract": "Despite diffusion models' superior capabilities in modeling complex distributions there are still non-trivial distributional discrepancies between generated and ground-truth images which has resulted in several notable problems in image generation including missing object errors in text-to-image generation and low image quality. Existing methods that attempt to address these problems mostly do not tend to address the fundamental cause behind these problems which is the distributional discrepancies and hence achieve sub-optimal results. In this paper we propose a particle filtering framework that can effectively address both problems by explicitly reducing the distributional discrepancies. Specifically our method relies on a set of external guidance including a small set of real images and a pre-trained object detector to gauge the distribution gap and then design the resampling weight accordingly to correct the gap. Experiments show that our methods can effectively correct missing object errors and improve image quality in various image generation tasks. Notably our method outperforms the existing strongest baseline by 5% in object occurrence and 1.0 in FID on MS-COCO.

    "abstract": "Vision-language (VL) models have achieved unprecedented success recently in which the connection module is the key to bridge the modality gap. Nevertheless the abundant visual clues are not sufficiently exploited in most existing methods. On the vision side most existing approaches only use the last feature of the vision tower without using the low-level features. On the language side most existing methods only introduce shallow vision-language interactions. In this paper we present a vision-inspired vision-language connection module dubbed as VIVL which efficiently exploits the vision cue for VL models. To take advantage of the lowerlevel information from the vision tower a feature pyramid extractor (FPE) is introduced to combine features from different intermediate layers which enriches the visual cue with negligible parameters and computation overhead. To enhance VL interactions we propose deep vision-conditioned prompts (DVCP) that allows deep interactions of vision and language features efficiently. Our VIVL exceeds the previous state-of-the-art method by 18.1 CIDEr when training from scratch on the COCO caption task which greatly improves the data efficiency. When used as a plug-in module VIVL consistently improves the performance for various backbones and VL frameworks delivering new state-of-the-art results on multiple benchmarks e.g. NoCaps and VQAv2",

    "abstract": "Monocular 3D object detection poses a significant challenge in 3D scene understanding due to its inherently ill-posed nature in monocular depth estimation. Existing methods heavily rely on supervised learning using abundant 3D labels typically obtained through expensive and labor-intensive annotation on LiDAR point clouds. To tackle this problem we propose a novel weakly supervised 3D object detection framework named VSRD (Volumetric Silhouette Rendering for Detection) to train 3D object detectors without any 3D supervision but only weak 2D supervision. VSRD consists of multi-view 3D auto-labeling and subsequent training of monocular 3D object detectors using the pseudo labels generated in the auto-labeling stage. In the auto-labeling stage we represent the surface of each instance as a signed distance field (SDF) and render its silhouette as an instance mask through our proposed instance-aware volumetric silhouette rendering. To directly optimize the 3D bounding boxes through rendering we decompose the SDF of each instance into the SDF of a cuboid and the residual distance field (RDF) that represents the residual from the cuboid. This mechanism enables us to optimize the 3D bounding boxes in an end-to-end manner by comparing the rendered instance masks with the ground truth instance masks. The optimized 3D bounding boxes serve as effective training data for 3D object detection. We conduct extensive experiments on the KITTI-360 dataset demonstrating that our method outperforms the existing weakly supervised 3D object detection methods.

However its application in video camouflaged object detection (VCOD) encounters challenges chiefly stemming from the overlooked temporal-spatial associations and the unreliability of user-provided prompts for camouflaged objects that are difficult to discern with the naked eye. To tackle the above issues we endow SAM with keen eyes and propose the Temporal-spatial Prompt SAM (TSP-SAM) a novel approach tailored for VCOD via an ingenious prompted learning scheme. Firstly motion-driven self-prompt learning is employed to capture the camouflaged object thereby bypassing the need for user-provided prompts. With the detected subtle motion cues across consecutive video frames the overall movement of the camouflaged object is captured for more precise spatial localization. Subsequently to eliminate the prompt bias resulting from inter-frame discontinuities the long-range consistency within the video sequences is taken into account to promote the robustness of the self-prompts. It is also injected into the encoder of SAM to enhance the representational capabilities. Extensive experimental results on two benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed TSP-SAM achieves a significant improvement over the state-of-the-art methods. With the mIoU metric increasing by 7.8% and 9.6% TSP-SAM emerges as a groundbreaking step forward in the field of VCOD",

The Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) is the gold-standard for assessing motor symptom severity yet its manual scoring criteria are vague and subjective resulting in coarse and noisy clinical assessments. Machine learning approaches have the potential to modernize PD symptom assessments by making them more quantitative objective and scalable. However the lack of benchmark video datasets for PD motor exams hinders model development. Here we introduce the TULIP dataset to bridge this gap. TULIP emphasizes precision and comprehensiveness comprising multi-view video recordings (6 cameras) of all 25 UPDRS motor exam components together with ratings by 3 clinical experts in a cohort of Parkinson's patients and healthy controls. The multi-view recordings enable 3D reconstructions of body movement that better capture disease signatures than more conventional 2D methods. Using the dataset we establish a baseline model for predicting UPDRS scores from 3D poses illustrating how existing diagnostics could be automated. Looking ahead TULIP could aid the development of new precision diagnostics that transcend UPDRS scores providing a deeper understanding of PD and its potential treatments",

Although this representation is flexible and easy to optimize most real-world objects can be modeled more efficiently with surfaces instead of volumes requiring far fewer samples per ray. This observation has spurred considerable progress in surface representations such as signed distance functions but these may struggle to model semi-opaque and thin structures. We propose a method HybridNeRF that leverages the strengths of both representations by rendering most objects as surfaces while modeling the (typically) small fraction of challenging regions volumetrically. We evaluate HybridNeRF against the challenging Eyeful Tower dataset along with other commonly used view synthesis datasets.

Cutting-edge solutions start to explore the benefits of pre-trained models and mainly follow the fixed paradigm of solely training an attached classifier e.g. combining frozen CLIP-ViT with a learnable linear layer in UniFD. However our analysis shows that such a fixed paradigm is prone to yield detectors with insufficient learning regarding forgery representations. We attribute the key challenge to the lack of forgery adaptation and present a novel forgery-aware adaptive transformer approach namely FatFormer. Based on the pre-trained vision-language spaces of CLIP FatFormer introduces two core designs for the adaption to build generalized forgery representations. First motivated by the fact that both image and frequency analysis are essential for synthetic image detection we develop a forgery-aware adapter to adapt image features to discern and integrate local forgery traces within image and frequency domains. Second we find that considering the contrastive objectives between adapted image features and text prompt embeddings a previously overlooked aspect results in a nontrivial generalization improvement. Accordingly we introduce language-guided alignment to supervise the forgery adaptation with image and text prompts in FatFormer. Experiments show that by coupling these two designs our approach tuned on 4-class ProGAN data attains a remarkable detection performance achieving an average of 98% accuracy to unseen GANs and surprisingly generalizes to unseen diffusion models with 95% accuracy",

To counter this we introduce \"motion patches\" a new representation of motion sequences and propose using Vision Transformers (ViT) as motion encoders via transfer learning aiming to extract useful knowledge from the image domain and apply it to the motion domain. These motion patches created by dividing and sorting skeleton joints based on body parts in motion sequences are robust to varying skeleton structures and can be regarded as color image patches in ViT. We find that transfer learning with pre-trained weights of ViT obtained through training with 2D image data can boost the performance of motion analysis presenting a promising direction for addressing the issue of limited motion data. Our extensive experiments show that the proposed motion patches used jointly with ViT achieve state-of-the-art performance in the benchmarks of text-to-motion retrieval and other novel challenging tasks such as cross-skeleton recognition zero-shot motion classification and human interaction recognition which are currently impeded by the lack of data",

    "abstract": "Eliminating image blur produced by various kinds of motion has been a challenging problem. Dominant approaches rely heavily on model capacity to remove blurring by reconstructing residual from blurry observation in feature space. These practices not only prevent the capture of spatially variable motion in the real world but also ignore the tailored handling of various motions in image space. In this paper we propose a novel real-world deblurring filtering model called the Motion-adaptive Separable Collaborative (MISC) Filter. In particular we use a motion estimation network to capture motion information from neighborhoods thereby adaptively estimating spatially-variant motion flow mask kernels weights and offsets to obtain the MISC Filter. The MISC Filter first aligns the motion-induced blurring patterns to the motion middle along the predicted flow direction and then collaboratively filters the aligned image through the predicted kernels weights and offsets to generate the output. This design can handle more generalized and complex motion in a spatially differentiated manner. Furthermore we analyze the relationships between the motion estimation network and the residual reconstruction network. Extensive experiments on four widely used benchmarks demonstrate that our method provides an effective solution for real-world motion blur removal and achieves state-of-the-art performance.

In contrast certain works directly produce 3D information via fast network inferences but their results are often of low quality and lack geometric details. To holistically improve the quality consistency and efficiency of image-to-3D tasks we propose a cross-domain diffusion model that generates multi-view normal maps and the corresponding color images. To ensure consistency we employ a multi-view cross-domain attention mechanism that facilitates information exchange across views and modalities.

    "abstract": "Real-world vision tasks frequently suffer from the appearance of unexpected adverse weather conditions including rain haze snow and raindrops. In the last decade convolutional neural networks and vision transformers have yielded outstanding results in single-weather video removal. However due to the absence of appropriate adaptation most of them fail to generalize to other weather conditions. Although ViWS-Net is proposed to remove adverse weather conditions in videos with a single set of pre-trained weights it is seriously blinded by seen weather at train-time and degenerates when coming to unseen weather during test-time. In this work we introduce test-time adaptation into adverse weather removal in videos and propose the first framework that integrates test-time adaptation into the iterative diffusion reverse process. Specifically we devise a diffusion-based network with a novel temporal noise model to efficiently explore frame-correlated information in degraded video clips at training stage. During inference stage we introduce a proxy task named Diffusion Tubelet Self-Calibration to learn the primer distribution of test video stream and optimize the model by approximating the temporal noise model for online adaptation. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our Test-Time Adaptation method with Diffusion-based network(Diff-TTA) outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of restoring videos degraded by seen weather conditions.

We then apply an iterative clustering strategy to group the nodes into clusters based on their 1D and 3D positions and assign scores to each cluster. We select the highest-scoring clusters and use their medoid nodes for the next iteration of clustering until we obtain a hierarchical and informative representation of the protein.

Previous approaches mostly employ complicated training strategies to leverage unlabeled data but overlook the role of correlation maps in modeling the relationships between pairs of locations. We observe that the correlation maps not only enable clustering pixels of the same category easily but also contain good shape information which previous works have omitted. Motivated by these we aim to improve the use efficiency of unlabeled data by designing two novel label propagation strategies. First we propose to conduct pixel propagation by modeling the pairwise similarities of pixels to spread the high-confidence pixels and dig out more. Then we perform region propagation to enhance the pseudo labels with accurate class-agnostic masks extracted from the correlation maps. CorrMatch achieves great performance on popular segmentation benchmarks. Taking the DeepLabV3+ with ResNet-101 backbone as our segmentation model we receive a 76%+ mIoU score on the Pascal VOC 2012 dataset with only 92 annotated images.

    "abstract": "Lifting 2D diffusion for 3D generation is a challenging problem due to the lack of geometric prior and the complex entanglement of materials and lighting in natural images. Existing methods have shown promise by first creating the geometry through score-distillation sampling (SDS) applied to rendered surface normals followed by appearance modeling. However relying on a 2D RGB diffusion model to optimize surface normals is suboptimal due to the distribution discrepancy between natural images and normals maps leading to instability in optimization. In this paper recognizing that the normal and depth information effectively describe scene geometry and be automatically estimated from images we propose to learn a generalizable Normal-Depth diffusion model for 3D generation. We achieve this by training on the large-scale LAION dataset together with the generalizable image-to-depth and normal prior models. In an attempt to alleviate the mixed illumination effects in the generated materials we introduce an albedo diffusion model to impose data-driven constraints on the albedo component.

Though diverse efficient attention mechanism designs have addressed the intensive computations associated with using transformers they often involve redundant information and noisy interactions from irrelevant regions by considering all available tokens. In this work we propose an Adaptive Sparse Transformer (AST) to mitigate the noisy interactions of irrelevant areas and remove feature redundancy in both spatial and channel domains. AST comprises two core designs i.e. an Adaptive Sparse Self-Attention (ASSA) block and a Feature Refinement Feed-forward Network (FRFN). Specifically ASSA is adaptively computed using a two-branch paradigm where the sparse branch is introduced to filter out the negative impacts of low query-key matching scores for aggregating features while the dense one ensures sufficient information flow through the network for learning discriminative representations. Meanwhile FRFN employs an enhance-and-ease scheme to eliminate feature redundancy in channels enhancing the restoration of clear latent images.

To address these challenges we propose a fully automated approach for creating a fully rigged character with pose-dependent skinning weights which can be solely learned from multi-view video. Therefore we first acquire a rigged template which is then statically skinned. Next a coordinate-based MLP learns a skinning weights field parameterized over the position in a canonical pose space and the respective pose. Moreover we introduce our pose- and view-dependent appearance field allowing us to differentiably render and supervise the posed mesh using multi-view imagery.

    "abstract": "Zero-shot referring expression comprehension aims at localizing bounding boxes in an image corresponding to provided textual prompts which requires: (i) a fine-grained disentanglement of complex visual scene and textual context and (ii) a capacity to understand relationships among disentangled entities. Unfortunately existing large vision-language alignment (VLA) models e.g. CLIP struggle with both aspects so cannot be directly used for this task. To mitigate this gap we leverage large foundation models to disentangle both images and texts into triplets in the format of (subject predicate object). After that grounding is accomplished by calculating the structural similarity matrix between visual and textual triplets with a VLA model and subsequently propagate it to an instance-level similarity matrix. Furthermore to equip VLA models with the ability of relationship understanding we design a triplet-matching objective to fine-tune the VLA models on a collection of curated dataset containing abundant entity relationships. Experiments demonstrate that our visual grounding performance increase of up to 19.5% over the SOTA zero-shot model on RefCOCO/+/g.

While large-scale domain-specific foundation models can help tackle this challenge their concentration on a single vision level makes it challenging to prompt both vision and language modalities. To overcome this we propose to leverage domain-specific knowledge from domain-specific foundation models to transfer the robust recognition ability of VLMs from generalized to specialized domains using quaternion networks. Specifically the proposed method involves using domain-specific vision features from domain-specific foundation models to guide the transformation of generalized contextual embeddings from the language branch into a specialized space within the quaternion networks. Moreover we present a hierarchical approach that generates vision prompt features by analyzing intermodal relationships between hierarchical language prompt features and domain-specific vision features. In this way quaternion networks can effectively mine the intermodal relationships in the specific domain facilitating domain-specific vision-language contrastive learning.

We introduce the BEHAVIOR Vision Suite (BVS) a set of tools and assets to generate fully customized synthetic data for systematic evaluation of computer vision models based on the newly developed embodied AI benchmark BEHAVIOR-1K. BVS supports a large number of adjustable parameters at the scene level (e.g. lighting object placement) the object level (e.g. joint configuration attributes such as \"filled\" and \"folded\") and the camera level (e.g. field of view focal length). Researchers can arbitrarily vary these parameters during data generation to perform controlled experiments. We showcase three example application scenarios: systematically evaluating the robustness of models across different continuous axes of domain shift evaluating scene understanding models on the same set of images and training and evaluating simulation-to-real transfer for a novel vision task: unary and binary state prediction.

    "abstract": "Recent advancements in 3D reconstruction from single images have been driven by the evolution of generative models. Prominent among these are methods based on Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) and the adaptation of diffusion models in the 3D domain. Despite their progress these techniques often face limitations due to slow optimization or rendering processes leading to extensive training and optimization times. In this paper we introduce a novel approach for single-view reconstruction that efficiently generates a 3D model from a single image via feed-forward inference. Our method utilizes two transformer-based networks namely a point decoder and a triplane decoder to reconstruct 3D objects using a hybrid Triplane-Gaussian intermediate representation. This hybrid representation strikes a balance achieving a faster rendering speed compared to implicit representations while simultaneously delivering superior rendering quality than explicit representations. The point decoder is designed for generating point clouds from single images offering an explicit representation which is then utilized by the triplane decoder to query Gaussian features for each point. This design choice addresses the challenges associated with directly regressing explicit 3D Gaussian attributes characterized by their non-structural nature. Subsequently the 3D Gaussians are decoded by an MLP to enable rapid rendering through splatting. Both decoders are built upon a scalable transformer-based architecture and have been efficiently trained on large-scale 3D datasets. The evaluations conducted on both synthetic datasets and real-world images demonstrate that our method not only achieves higher quality but also ensures a faster runtime in comparison to previous state-of-the-art techniques.

    "abstract": "The advances in the Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) research offer extensive applications in diverse domains but protecting their copyrights has not yet been researched in depth. Recently NeRF watermarking has been considered one of the pivotal solutions for safely deploying NeRF-based 3D representations. However existing methods are designed to apply only to implicit or explicit NeRF representations. In this work we introduce an innovative watermarking method that can be employed in both representations of NeRF. This is achieved by fine-tuning NeRF to embed binary messages in the rendering process. In detail we propose utilizing the discrete wavelet transform in the NeRF space for watermarking. Furthermore we adopt a deferred back-propagation technique and introduce a combination with the patch-wise loss to improve rendering quality and bit accuracy with minimum trade-offs. We evaluate our method in three different aspects: capacity invisibility and robustness of the embedded watermarks in the 2D-rendered images. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance with faster training speed over the compared state-of-the-art methods. Project page: https://kuai-lab.github.io/cvpr2024waterf/",

In contrast to the prevalent NeRF-based approaches hampered by slow training and rendering speeds our approach harnesses recent advancements in point-based 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). Specifically a novel Dual-Domain Deformation Model (DDDM) is proposed to explicitly model attribute deformations of each Gaussian point where the time-dependent residual of each attribute is captured by a polynomial fitting in the time domain and a Fourier series fitting in the frequency domain. The proposed DDDM is capable of modeling complex scene deformations across long video footage eliminating the need for training separate 3DGS for each frame or introducing an additional implicit neural field to model 3D dynamics. Moreover the explicit deformation modeling for discretized Gaussian points ensures ultra-fast training and rendering of a 4D scene which is comparable to the original 3DGS designed for static 3D reconstruction. Our proposed approach showcases a substantial efficiency improvement achieving a 5xfaster training speed compared to the per-frame 3DGS modeling.

While several powerful distillation methods were recently proposed the overall quality of student samples is typically lower compared to the teacher ones which hinders their practical usage. In this work we investigate the relative quality of samples produced by the teacher text-to-image diffusion model and its distilled student version. As our main empirical finding we discover that a noticeable portion of student samples exhibit superior fidelity compared to the teacher ones despite the approximate nature of the student. Based on this finding we propose an adaptive collaboration between student and teacher diffusion models for effective text-to-image synthesis. Specifically the distilled model produces an initial image sample and then an oracle decides whether it needs further improvements with the teacher model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the designed pipeline surpasses state-of-the-art text-to-image alternatives for various inference budgets in terms of human preference.

    "abstract": "Recently efficient Vision Transformers have shown great performance with low latency on resource-constrained devices. Conventionally they use 4x4 patch embeddings and a 4-stage structure at the macro level while utilizing sophisticated attention with multi-head configuration at the micro level. This paper aims to address computational redundancy at all design levels in a memory-efficient manner. We discover that using larger-stride patchify stem not only reduces memory access costs but also achieves competitive performance by leveraging token representations with reduced spatial redundancy from the early stages. Furthermore our preliminary analyses suggest that attention layers in the early stages can be substituted with convolutions and several attention heads in the latter stages are computationally redundant. To handle this we introduce a single-head attention module that inherently prevents head redundancy and simultaneously boosts accuracy by parallelly combining global and local information. Building upon our solutions we introduce SHViT a Single-Head Vision Transformer that obtains the state-of-the-art speed-accuracy tradeoff. For example on ImageNet-1k our SHViT-S4 is 3.3x 8.1x and 2.4x faster than MobileViTv2x1.0 on GPU CPU and iPhone12 mobile device respectively while being 1.3% more accurate.

To address these challenges we propose a robust and efficient flow estimator tailored for real-time HDR video reconstruction named HDRFlow. HDRFlow has three novel designs: an HDR-domain alignment loss (HALoss) an efficient flow network with a multi-size large kernel (MLK) and a new HDR flow training scheme. The HALoss supervises our flow network to learn an HDR-oriented flow for accurate alignment in saturated and dark regions. The MLK can effectively model large motions at a negligible cost. In addition we incorporate synthetic data Sintel into our training dataset utilizing both its provided forward flow and backward flow generated by us to supervise our flow network enhancing our performance in large motion regions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our HDRFlow outperforms previous methods on standard benchmarks.

The use of polarization makes it invisible and lets us recover not only depth but also directly surface normals and even reflectance.

We derive a novel method for robustly extracting the projected structured polarization pattern from the polarimetric object appearance. We evaluate the effectiveness of SPIDeRS by applying it to a number of real-world objects.

Although many recent studies have shown the remarkable improvement in human mesh reconstruction it is still difficult to generate accurate meshes when person-to-person occlusion occurs due to the ambiguity of who a body part belongs to. To address this problem we propose an instance-aware contrastive learning scheme. Specifically joint features belonging to the target human are trained to be proximate with the anchor feature (i.e. feature extracted from the body center position). On the other hand anchor features of different human instances are forced to be far apart so that joint features of each person can be clearly distinguished from others. By interpreting the joint possession based on such contrastive learning scheme the proposed method easily understands the spatial occupancy of body parts for each person in a given image thus can reconstruct reliable human meshes even with severely overlapped cases between multiple persons. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate the robustness of the proposed method compared to previous approaches under person-to-person occlusions.

ADF only requires RGB images as input to effectively train the optical flow network on the target data domain. Specifically we use advanced NeRF technology to reconstruct scenes from photo groups collected by a monocular camera and then calculate optical flow labels between camera pose pairs based on the rendering results. To eliminate erroneous labels caused by defects in the scene reconstructed by NeRF we screened the generated labels from multiple aspects such as optical flow matching accuracy radiation field confidence and depth consistency. The filtered labels can be directly used for network supervision.

To address this problem we introduce a novel regularization approach named Equivariant Similarity Consistency (ESC) which can facilitate robust clean and noisy data separation and improve the training for cross-modal matching. Intuitively our method posits that the semantic variations caused by image changes should be proportional to those caused by text changes for any two matched samples. Accordingly we first calculate the ESC by comparing image and text semantic variations between a set of elaborated anchor points and other undivided training data. Then pairs with high ESC are filtered out as noisy correspondence pairs. We implement our method by combining the ESC with a traditional hinge-based triplet loss.

We propose a novel approach for building accurate 3D maps of dynamic environments utilizing a sequence of LiDAR scans. To this end we propose encoding the 4D scene into a novel spatio-temporal implicit neural map representation by fitting a time-dependent truncated signed distance function to each point. Using our representation we can extract the static map by filtering the dynamic parts. Our neural representation is based on sparse feature grids a globally shared decoder and time-dependent basis functions which can be jointly optimized in an unsupervised fashion. To learn this representation from a sequence of LiDAR scans we design a simple yet efficient loss function to supervise the map optimization in a piecewise way. We evaluate our approach on various scenes containing moving objects in terms of the reconstruction quality of static maps and the segmentation of dynamic point clouds. The experimental results demonstrate that our method is capable of removing the dynamic part of the input point clouds while reconstructing accurate and complete large-scale 3D maps outperforming several state-of-the-art methods for static map generation and scene reconstruction",

In this paper we explore the potential of personalized face restoration with diffusion models. In our approach a restoration model is personalized using a few images of the identity leading to tailored restoration with respect to the identity while retaining fine-grained details. By using independent trainable blocks for personalization the rich prior of a base restoration model can be exploited to its fullest. To avoid the model relying on parts of identity left in the conditioning low-quality images a generative regularizer is employed. With a learnable parameter the model learns to balance between the details generated based on the input image and the degree of personalization. Moreover we improve the training pipeline of face restoration models to enable an alignment-free approach. We showcase the robust capabilities of our approach in several real-world scenarios with multiple identities demonstrating our method's ability to generate fine-grained details with faithful restoration.

In contrast TextureDreamer can transfer highly detailed intricate textures from real-world environments to arbitrary objects with only a few casually captured images potentially significantly democratizing texture creation.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Image Quality Assessment (IQA) constitutes a fundamental task within the field of computer vision yet it remains an unresolved challenge owing to the intricate distortion conditions diverse image contents and limited availability of data. Recently the community has witnessed the emergence of numerous large-scale pretrained foundation models. However it remains an open problem whether the scaling law in high-level tasks is also applicable to IQA tasks which are closely related to low-level clues. In this paper we demonstrate that with a proper injection of local distortion features a larger pretrained vision transformer (ViT) foundation model performs better in IQA tasks. Specifically for the lack of local distortion structure and inductive bias of the large-scale pretrained ViT we use another pretrained convolution neural networks (CNNs) which is well known for capturing the local structure to extract multi-scale image features. Further we propose a local distortion extractor to obtain local distortion features from the pretrained CNNs and a local distortion injector to inject the local distortion features into ViT. By only training the extractor and injector our method can benefit from the rich knowledge in the powerful foundation models and achieve state-of-the-art performance on popular IQA datasets indicating that IQA is not only a low-level problem but also benefits from stronger high-level features drawn from large-scale pretrained models.

However an intriguing problem persists: Is it possible to capture multiple novel concepts from one single reference image? In this paper we identify that existing approaches fail to preserve visual consistency with the reference image and eliminate cross-influence from concepts. To alleviate this we propose an attention calibration mechanism to improve the concept-level understanding of the T2I model. Specifically we first introduce new learnable modifiers bound with classes to capture attributes of multiple concepts. Then the classes are separated and strengthened following the activation of the cross-attention operation ensuring comprehensive and self-contained concepts. Additionally we suppress the attention activation of different classes to mitigate mutual influence among concepts. Together our proposed method dubbed DisenDiff can learn disentangled multiple concepts from one single image and produce novel customized images with learned concepts.

Most 3D diffusion models focus on generating a single object synthetic indoor scenes or synthetic outdoor scenes while the generation of real-world outdoor scenes is rarely addressed. In this paper we concentrate on generating a real-outdoor scene through learning a diffusion model on a real-world outdoor dataset. In contrast to synthetic data real-outdoor datasets often contain more empty spaces due to sensor limitations causing challenges in learning real-outdoor distributions. To address this issue we exploit a triplane representation as a proxy form of scene distributions to be learned by our diffusion model. Furthermore we propose a triplane manipulation that integrates seamlessly with our triplane diffusion model. The manipulation improves our diffusion model's applicability in a variety of downstream tasks related to outdoor scene generation such as scene inpainting scene outpainting and semantic scene completion refinements. In experimental results we demonstrate that our triplane diffusion model shows meaningful generation results compared with existing work in a real-outdoor dataset SemanticKITTI. We also show our triplane manipulation facilitates seamlessly adding removing or modifying objects within a scene. Further it also enables the expansion of scenes toward a city-level scale.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "With the emergence of pre-trained vision-language models like CLIP how to adapt them to various downstream classification tasks has garnered significant attention in recent research. The adaptation strategies can be typically categorized into three paradigms: zero-shot adaptation few-shot adaptation and the recently-proposed training-free few-shot adaptation. Most existing approaches are tailored for a specific setting and can only cater to one or two of these paradigms. In this paper we introduce a versatile adaptation approach that can effectively work under all three settings. Specifically we propose the dual memory networks that comprise dynamic and static memory components. The static memory caches training data knowledge enabling training-free few-shot adaptation while the dynamic memory preserves historical test features online during the testing process allowing for the exploration of additional data insights beyond the training set. This novel capability enhances model performance in the few-shot setting and enables model usability in the absence of training data. The two memory networks employ the same flexible memory interactive strategy which can operate in a training-free mode and can be further enhanced by incorporating learnable projection layers. Our approach is tested across 11 datasets under the three task settings. Remarkably in the zero-shot scenario it outperforms existing methods by over 3% and even shows superior results against methods utilizing external training data. Additionally our method exhibits robust performance against natural distribution shifts",

Our approach is underpinned by two contributions: Field Latents a latent representation encoding textures as discrete vector fields on the mesh vertices and Field Latent Diffusion Models which learn to denoise a diffusion process in the learned latent space on the surface. We consider a single-textured-mesh paradigm where our models are trained to generate variations of a given texture on a mesh. We show the synthesized textures are of superior fidelity compared those from existing single-textured-mesh generative models. Our models can also be adapted for user-controlled editing tasks such as inpainting and label-guided generation. The efficacy of our approach is due in part to the equivariance of our proposed framework under isometries allowing our models to seamlessly reproduce details across locally similar regions and opening the door to a notion of generative texture transfer.

However most of the existing MLLMs mainly adopt vision encoders pretrained on coarsely aligned image-text pairs leading to insufficient extraction and reasoning of visual knowledge. To address this issue we devise a dual-Level vIsual knOwledge eNhanced Multimodal Large Language Model (LION) which empowers the MLLM by injecting visual knowledge in two levels. 1) Progressive incorporation of fine-grained spatial-aware visual knowledge. We design a vision aggregator cooperated with region-level vision-language (VL) tasks to incorporate fine-grained spatial-aware visual knowledge into the MLLM. To alleviate the conflict between image-level and region-level VL tasks during incorporation we devise a dedicated stage-wise instruction-tuning strategy with mixture-of-adapters. This progressive incorporation scheme contributes to the mutual promotion between these two kinds of VL tasks. 2) Soft prompting of high-level semantic visual evidence. We facilitate the MLLM with high-level semantic visual evidence by leveraging diverse image tags. To mitigate the potential influence caused by imperfect predicted tags we propose a soft prompting method by embedding a learnable token into the tailored text instruction.

Inspired by this we study selective view pipelining for efficient multi-view understanding which breaks computation of multiple views into steps and only computes the most helpful views/steps in a parallel manner for the best efficiency. To this end we use reinforcement learning to learn a very light view selection module that analyzes the target object or scenario from initial views and selects the next-best-view for recognition or detection for pipeline computation.

We study the possibility of selective prediction for vision-language models in a realistic black-box setting. We propose using the principle of neighborhood consistency to identify unreliable responses from a black-box vision-language model in question answering tasks. We hypothesize that given only a visual question and model response the consistency of the model's responses over the neighborhood of a visual question will indicate reliability. It is impossible to directly sample neighbors in feature space in a black-box setting. Instead we show that it is possible to use a smaller proxy model to approximately sample from the neighborhood. We find that neighborhood consistency can be used to identify model responses to visual questions that are likely unreliable even in adversarial settings or settings that are out-of-distribution to the proxy model",

In this paper we introduce SAI3D a novel zero-shot 3D instance segmentation approach that synergistically leverages geometric priors and semantic cues derived from Segment Anything Model (SAM). Our method partitions a 3D scene into geometric primitives which are then progressively merged into 3D instance segmentations that are consistent with the multi-view SAM masks.

To address these challenges this paper proposes a novel Implicit Motion Function (IMF) method. Our approach utilizes a low-dimensional latent token as the implicit representation along with the use of cross-attention to implicitly model the correlation between frames. This enables the implicit modeling of temporal correlations and understanding of object motions. Our method not only improves sparsity and efficiency in representation but also explores the generative capabilities of the decoder by integrating correlation modeling within it. The IMF framework facilitates video editing and other generative tasks by allowing the direct manipulation of latent tokens.

Existing methods usually focus on improving TTA performance under covariate shifts while neglecting semantic shifts. In this paper we delve into a realistic open-set TTA setting where the target domain may contain samples from unknown classes. Many state-of-the-art closed-set TTA methods perform poorly when applied to open-set scenarios which can be attributed to the inaccurate estimation of data distribution and model confidence. To address these issues we propose a simple but effective framework called unified entropy optimization (UniEnt) which is capable of simultaneously adapting to covariate-shifted in-distribution (csID) data and detecting covariate-shifted out-of-distribution (csOOD) data. Specifically UniEnt first mines pseudo-csID and pseudo-csOOD samples from test data followed by entropy minimization on the pseudo-csID data and entropy maximization on the pseudo-csOOD data. Furthermore we introduce UniEnt+ to alleviate the noise caused by hard data partition leveraging sample-level confidence.

Nevertheless achieving dense point clouds to accurately represent texture details poses a challenge due to limited computational resources. To address these challenges we propose an efficient octree-based diffusion pipeline called TexOct.

We utilize an octree structure to efficiently represent this point cloud. Additionally we introduce an innovative octree-based diffusion model that leverages the denoising capabilities of the Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM). This model gradually reduces the texture noise on the octree nodes resulting in the restoration of fine texture.

Despite the strong performance of Pre-Trained Models (PTMs) in CIL a critical issue persists: learning new classes often results in the overwriting of old ones. Excessive modification of the network causes forgetting while minimal adjustments lead to an inadequate fit for new classes. As a result it is desired to figure out a way of efficient model updating without harming former knowledge. In this paper we propose ExpAndable Subspace Ensemble (EASE) for PTM-based CIL. To enable model updating without conflict we train a distinct lightweight adapter module for each new task aiming to create task-specific subspaces. These adapters span a high-dimensional feature space enabling joint decision-making across multiple subspaces. As data evolves the expanding subspaces render the old class classifiers incompatible with new-stage spaces. Correspondingly we design a semantic-guided prototype complement strategy that synthesizes old classes' new features without using any old class instance.

Unlike less-interacted motions closely interacted motions contain frequently occurring inter-human occlusions which pose significant challenges to existing capturing algorithms. To address this problem our key observation is that close physical interactions between two subjects typically happen under very specific situations (e.g. handshake hug etc.) and such situational contexts contain strong prior semantics to help infer the poses of occluded joints. In this spirit we introduce reaction priors which are invertible neural networks that bi-directionally model the pose probability distributions of one person given the pose of the other. The learned reaction priors are then incorporated into a query-based pose estimator which is a decoder-only Transformer with self-attentions on both intra-joint and inter-joint relationships. We demonstrate that our design achieves considerably higher performance than previous methods on multiple benchmarks. What's more as existing datasets lack sufficient cases of close human-human interactions we also build a new dataset called Dual-Human to better evaluate different methods. Dual-Human contains around 2k sequences of closely interacted two-person motions each with synthetic multi-view renderings contact annotations and text descriptions.

Monocular depth enables us to condition our model on warped reference images for the target views increasing geometric stability. The video-diffusion prior provides a strong proxy for 3D scenes allowing the model to learn continuous and pixel-accurate correspondences across generated images. In contrast to approaches relying on autoregressive image generation that are prone to drifts and error accumulation MultiDiff jointly synthesizes a sequence of frames yielding high-quality and multi-view consistent results -- even for long-term scene generation with large camera movements while reducing inference time by an order of magnitude. For additional consistency and image quality improvements we introduce a novel structured noise distribution.

We address this issue by explicitly modeling OOD objects from the input in 3D-aware GANs. Our core idea is to represent the image using two individual neural radiance fields: one for the in-distribution content and the other for the out-of-distribution object. The final reconstruction is achieved by optimizing the composition of these two radiance fields with carefully designed regularization.

Yet existing methods for chemical structure recognition do not typically generalize well and show diminished effectiveness when confronted with domains where data is sparse or costly to generate such as hand-drawn molecule images. To address this limitation we propose a new chemical structure recognition tool that delivers state-of-the-art performance and can adapt to new domains with a limited number of data samples and supervision. Unlike previous approaches our method provides atom-level localization and can therefore segment the image into the different atoms and bonds. Our model is the first model to perform OCSR with atom-level entity detection with only SMILES supervision.

    "abstract": "As an important pillar of underwater intelligence Marine Animal Segmentation (MAS) involves segmenting animals within marine environments. Previous methods don't excel in extracting long-range contextual features and overlook the connectivity between discrete pixels. Recently Segment Anything Model (SAM) offers a universal framework for general segmentation tasks. Unfortunately trained with natural images SAM does not obtain the prior knowledge from marine images. In addition the single-position prompt of SAM is very insufficient for prior guidance. To address these issues we propose a novel feature learning framework named Dual-SAM for high-performance MAS. To this end we first introduce a dual structure with SAM's paradigm to enhance feature learning of marine images. Then we propose a Multi-level Coupled Prompt (MCP) strategy to instruct comprehensive underwater prior information and enhance the multi-level features of SAM's encoder with adapters. Subsequently we design a Dilated Fusion Attention Module (DFAM) to progressively integrate multi-level features from SAM's encoder. Finally instead of directly predicting the masks of marine animals we propose a Criss-Cross Connectivity Prediction (C3P) paradigm to capture the inter-connectivity between discrete pixels. With dual decoders it generates pseudo-labels and achieves mutual supervision for complementary feature representations resulting in considerable improvements over previous techniques. Extensive experiments verify that our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performances on five widely-used MAS datasets. The code is available at https://github.com/Drchip61/Dual SAM",

We observe the powerful generation ability of off-the-shelf video or audio generation models.

In this paper we present MoDeC a time constraint-aware embodied control framework using the modular model adaptation. We formulate model adaptation to varying operational conditions on resource and time restrictions as dynamic routing on a modular network incorporating these conditions as part of multi-task objectives.

    "abstract": "The pretraining-finetuning paradigm has gained popularity in various computer vision tasks. In this paradigm the emergence of active finetuning arises due to the abundance of large-scale data and costly annotation requirements. Active finetuning involves selecting a subset of data from an unlabeled pool for annotation facilitating subsequent finetuning. However the use of a limited number of training samples can lead to a biased distribution potentially resulting in model overfitting. In this paper we propose a new method called ActiveDC for the active finetuning tasks. Firstly we select samples for annotation by optimizing the distribution similarity between the subset to be selected and the entire unlabeled pool in continuous space. Secondly we calibrate the distribution of the selected samples by exploiting implicit category information in the unlabeled pool. The feature visualization provides an intuitive sense of the effectiveness of our approach to distribution calibration. We conducted extensive experiments on three image classification datasets with different sampling ratios. The results indicate that ActiveDC consistently outperforms the baseline performance in all image classification tasks. The improvement is particularly significant when the sampling ratio is low with performance gains of up to 10%. Our code will be released",

    "abstract": "Machine learning holds tremendous promise for transforming the fundamental practice of scientific discovery by virtue of its data-driven nature. With the ever-increasing stream of research data collection it would be appealing to autonomously explore patterns and insights from observational data for discovering novel classes of phenotypes and concepts. However in the biomedical domain there are several challenges inherently presented in the cumulated data which hamper the progress of novel class discovery. The non-i.i.d. data distribution accompanied by the severe imbalance among different groups of classes essentially leads to ambiguous and biased semantic representations. In this work we present a geometry-constrained probabilistic modeling treatment to resolve the identified issues. First we propose to parameterize the approximated posterior of instance embedding as a marginal von Mises-Fisher distribution to account for the interference of distributional latent bias. Then we incorporate a suite of critical geometric properties to impose proper constraints on the layout of constructed embedding space which in turn minimizes the uncontrollable risk for unknown class learning and structuring. Furthermore a spectral graph-theoretic method is devised to estimate the number of potential novel classes. It inherits two intriguing merits compared to existent approaches namely high computational efficiency and flexibility for taxonomy-adaptive estimation.

    "abstract": "Generative models have been very popular in the recent years for their image generation capabilities. GAN-based models are highly regarded for their disentangled latent space which is a key feature contributing to their success in controlled image editing. On the other hand diffusion models have emerged as powerful tools for generating high-quality images. However the latent space of diffusion models is not as thoroughly explored or understood. Existing methods that aim to explore the latent space of diffusion models usually relies on text prompts to pinpoint specific semantics. However this approach may be restrictive in areas such as art fashion or specialized fields like medicine where suitable text prompts might not be available or easy to conceive thus limiting the scope of existing work. In this paper we propose an unsupervised method to discover latent semantics in text-to-image diffusion models without relying on text prompts. Our method takes a small set of unlabeled images from specific domains such as faces or cats and a pre-trained diffusion model and discovers diverse semantics in unsupervised fashion using a contrastive learning objective. Moreover the learned directions can be applied simultaneously either within the same domain (such as various types of facial edits) or across different domains (such as applying cat and face edits within the same image) without interfering with each other. Our extensive experiments show that our method achieves highly disentangled edits outperforming existing approaches in both diffusion-based and GAN-based latent space editing methods",

Importantly our new directional encoding captures the spatially-varying nature of near-field lighting and emulates the behavior of prefiltered environment maps. As a result it enables the efficient evaluation of preconvolved specular color at any 3D location with varying roughness coefficients.

    "abstract": "In subject-driven text-to-image synthesis the synthesis process tends to be heavily influenced by the reference images provided by users often overlooking crucial attributes detailed in the text prompt. In this work we propose Subject-Agnostic Guidance (SAG) a simple yet effective solution to remedy the problem. We show that through constructing a subject-agnostic condition and applying our proposed dual classifier-free guidance one could obtain outputs consistent with both the given subject and input text prompts. We validate the efficacy of our approach through both optimization-based and encoder-based methods. Additionally we demonstrate its applicability in second-order customization methods where an encoder-based model is fine-tuned with DreamBooth. Our approach is conceptually simple and requires only minimal code modifications but leads to substantial quality improvements as evidenced by our evaluations and user studies",

In contrast to LLMs human preference learning has not been widely explored in text-to-image diffusion models; the best existing approach is to fine-tune a pretrained model using carefully curated high quality images and captions to improve visual appeal and text alignment. We propose Diffusion-DPO a method to align diffusion models to human preferences by directly optimizing on human comparison data. Diffusion-DPO is adapted from the recently developed Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) a simpler alternative to RLHF which directly optimizes a policy that best satisfies human preferences under a classification objective. We re-formulate DPO to account for a diffusion model notion of likelihood utilizing the evidence lower bound to derive a differentiable objective. Using the Pick-a-pic dataset of 851K crowdsourced pairwise preferences we fine-tune the base model of the state-of-the-art Stable Diffusion XL (SDXL)-1.0 model with Diffusion-DPO. Our fine-tuned base model significantly outperforms both base SDXL-1.0 and the larger SDXL-1.0 model consisting of an additional refinement model in human evaluation improving visual appeal and prompt alignment. We also develop a variant that uses AI feedback and has comparable performance to training on human preferences opening the door for scaling of diffusion model alignment methods",

    "abstract": "Advanced life forms sustained by the synergistic interaction of neural cognitive mechanisms continually acquire and transfer knowledge throughout their lifespan. In contrast contemporary machine learning paradigms exhibit limitations in emulating the facets of continual learning (CL). Nonetheless the emergence of large language models (LLMs) presents promising avenues for realizing CL via interactions with these models. Drawing on Complementary Learning System theory this paper presents a novel Interactive Continual Learning (ICL) framework enabled by collaborative interactions among models of various sizes. Specifically we assign the ViT model as System1 and multimodal LLM as System2. To enable the memory module to deduce tasks from class information and enhance Set2Set retrieval we propose the Class-Knowledge-Task Multi-Head Attention (CKT-MHA). Additionally to improve memory retrieval in System1 through enhanced geometric representation we introduce the CL-vMF mechanism based on the von Mises-Fisher (vMF) distribution. Meanwhile we introduce the von Mises-Fisher Outlier Detection and Interaction (vMF-ODI) strategy to identify hard examples thus enhancing collaboration between System1 and System2 for complex reasoning realization. Comprehensive evaluation of our proposed ICL demonstrates significant resistance to forgetting and superior performance relative to existing methods. Code is available at github.com/ICL",

    "abstract": "The inherent generative power of denoising diffusion models makes them well-suited for image restoration tasks where the objective is to find the optimal high-quality image within the generative space that closely resembles the input image. We propose a method to adapt a pretrained diffusion model for image restoration by simply adding noise to the input image to be restored and then denoise. Our method is based on the observation that the space of a generative model needs to be constrained. We impose this constraint by finetuning the generative model with a set of anchor images that capture the characteristics of the input image. With the constrained space we can then leverage the sampling strategy used for generation to do image restoration. We evaluate against previous methods and show superior performances on multiple real-world restoration datasets in preserving identity and image quality. We also demonstrate an important and practical application on personalized restoration where we use a personal album as the anchor images to constrain the generative space.

Capturing the four measurements in sequence renders the system slow invariably causing inaccuracies in depth estimates due to motion in the scene or the camera. To mitigate this problem we propose a snapshot Lidar that captures amplitude and phase simultaneously as a single time-of-flight hologram.

To demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed system we design and build a lab prototype and evaluate it under varying scene geometries illumination conditions and compare the reconstructed depth measurements against conventional techniques. We rigorously evaluate the robustness of our system on diverse real-world scenes to show that our technique results in a significant reduction in data bandwidth with minimal loss in reconstruction accuracy.

Recently pre-trained vision transformers combined with prompt tuning have shown promise for overcoming catastrophic forgetting in CL.

In addition the lack of fine-grained layer specific prompts does not allow these to fully express the strength of the prompts for CL. We address these limitations by proposing ConvPrompt a novel convolutional prompt creation mechanism that maintains layer-wise shared embeddings enabling both layer-specific learning and better concept transfer across tasks. The intelligent use of convolution enables us to maintain a low parameter overhead without compromising performance. We further leverage Large Language Models to generate fine-grained text descriptions of each category which are used to get task similarity and dynamically decide the number of prompts to be learned. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of ConvPrompt and improves SOTA by 3% with significantly less parameter overhead.

Mainstream approaches employ bidirectional feature propagation spatio-temporal transformers or a combination of both to extract information from the video sequence.

Additionally bidirectional feature propagation is highly sensitive to inaccurate optical flow in blurry frames leading to error accumulation during the propagation process. To address these issues we propose BSSTNet Blur-aware Spatio-temporal Sparse Transformer Network. It introduces the blur map which converts the originally dense attention into a sparse form enabling a more extensive utilization of information throughout the entire video sequence. Specifically BSSTNet (1) uses a longer temporal window in the transformer leveraging information from more distant frames to restore the blurry pixels in the current frame. (2) introduces bidirectional feature propagation guided by blur maps which reduces error accumulation caused by the blur frame.

The recent segment anything model (SAM) has emerged as a powerful tool for extracting advanced semantic priors to enhance IR tasks.

The incorporation of SAM for extracting semantic priors considerably hampers the model inference efficiency. To address this issue we propose a general framework to distill SAM's semantic knowledge to boost exiting IR models without interfering with their inference process. Specifically our proposed framework consists of the semantic priors fusion (SPF) scheme and the semantic priors distillation (SPD) scheme. SPF fuses two kinds of information between the restored image predicted by the original IR model and the semantic mask predicted by SAM for the refined restored image. SPD leverages a self-distillation manner to distill the fused semantic priors to boost the performance of original IR models. Additionallywe design a semantic-guided relation (SGR) module for SPD which ensures semantic feature representation space consistency to fully distill the priors.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "While existing methods for 3D face reconstruction from in-the-wild images excel at recovering the overall face shape they commonly miss subtle extreme asymmetric or rarely observed expressions. We improve upon these methods with SMIRK (Spatial Modeling for Image-based Reconstruction of Kinesics) which faithfully reconstructs expressive 3D faces from images. We identify two key limitations in existing methods: shortcomings in their self-supervised training formulation and a lack of expression diversity in the training images. For training most methods employ differentiable rendering to compare a predicted face mesh with the input image along with a plethora of additional loss functions. This differentiable rendering loss not only has to provide supervision to optimize for 3D face geometry camera albedo and lighting which is an ill-posed optimization problem but the domain gap between rendering and input image further hinders the learning process. Instead SMIRK replaces the differentiable rendering with a neural rendering module that given the rendered predicted mesh geometry and sparsely sampled pixels of the input image generates a face image. As the neural rendering gets color information from sampled image pixels supervising with neural rendering-based reconstruction loss can focus solely on the geometry. Further it enables us to generate images of the input identity with varying expressions while training. These are then utilized as input to the reconstruction model and used as supervision with ground truth geometry. This effectively augments the training data and enhances the generalization for diverse expressions. Our qualitative quantitative and particularly our perceptual evaluations demonstrate that SMIRK achieves the new state-of-the art performance on accurate expression reconstruction.

Vehicle-infrastructure cooperation (VIC) becomes one of the important research area.

To further enhance the accuracy of roadside perception and provide better information to the vehicle side in this paper we constructed holographic intersections with various layouts to build a large-scale multi-sensor holographic vehicle-infrastructure cooperation dataset called HoloVIC. Our dataset includes 3 different types of sensors (Camera Lidar Fisheye) and employs 4 sensor-layouts based on the different intersections. Each intersection is equipped with 6-18 sensors to capture synchronous data. While autonomous vehicles pass through these intersections for collecting VIC data. HoloVIC contains in total on 100k+ synchronous frames from different sensors. Additionally we annotated 3D bounding boxes based on Camera Fisheye and Lidar. We also associate the IDs of the same objects across different devices and consecutive frames in sequence. Based on HoloVIC we formulated four tasks to facilitate the development of related research.

    "abstract": "The Segment Anything Model (SAM) has garnered significant attention for its versatile segmentation abilities and intuitive prompt-based interface. However its application in medical imaging presents challenges requiring either substantial training costs and extensive medical datasets for full model fine-tuning or high-quality prompts for optimal performance. This paper introduces H-SAM: a prompt-free adaptation of SAM tailored for efficient fine-tuning of medical images via a two-stage hierarchical decoding procedure. In the initial stage H-SAM employs SAM's original decoder to generate a prior probabilistic mask guiding a more intricate decoding process in the second stage. Specifically we propose two key designs: 1) A class-balanced mask-guided self-attention mechanism addressing the unbalanced label distribution enhancing image embedding; 2) A learnable mask cross-attention mechanism spatially modulating the interplay among different image regions based on the prior mask. Moreover the inclusion of a hierarchical pixel decoder in H-SAM enhances its proficiency in capturing fine-grained and localized details. This approach enables SAM to effectively integrate learned medical priors facilitating enhanced adaptation for medical image segmentation with limited samples. Our H-SAM demonstrates a 4.78% improvement in average Dice compared to existing prompt-free SAM variants for multi-organ segmentation using only 10% of 2D slices. Notably without using any unlabeled data H-SAM even outperforms state-of-the-art semi-supervised models relying on extensive unlabeled training data across various medical datasets.

    "abstract": "Style transfer aims to render an image with the artistic features of a style image while maintaining the original structure. Various methods have been put forward for this task but some challenges still exist. For instance it is difficult for CNN-based methods to handle global information and long-range dependencies between input images for which transformer-based methods have been proposed. Although transformer can better model the relationship between content and style images they require high-cost hardware and time-consuming inference. To address these issues we design a novel transformer model that includes only encoders thus significantly reducing the computational cost. In addition we also find that existing style transfer methods may lead to images under-stylied or missing content. In order to achieve better stylization we design a content feature extractor and a style feature extractor. Then we can feed pure content and style images into the transformer. Finally we propose a network model termed Puff-Net i.e. efficient style transfer with pure content and style feature fusion network. Through qualitative and quantitative experiments we demonstrate the advantages of our model compared to state-of-the-art ones in the literature.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Image warping a classic task in computer vision aims to use geometric transformations to change the appearance of images. Recent methods learn the resampling kernels for warping through neural networks to estimate missing values in irregular grids which however fail to capture local variations in deformed content and produce images with distortion and less high-frequency details. To address this issue this paper proposes an effective method namely MFR to learn Multi-Frequency Representations from input images for image warping. Specifically we propose a progressive filtering network to learn image representations from different frequency subbands and generate deformable images in a coarse-to-fine manner. Furthermore we employ learnable Gabor wavelet filters to improve the model's capability to learn local spatial-frequency representations. Comprehensive experiments including homography transformation equirectangular to perspective projection and asymmetric image super-resolution demonstrate that the proposed MFR significantly outperforms state-of-the-art image warping methods. Our method also showcases superior generalization to out-of-distribution domains where the generated images are equipped with rich details and less distortion thereby high visual quality.

Traditional camera exposure control methods require multiple convergence steps and time-consuming processes making them unsuitable for dynamic lighting conditions. In this paper we propose a new camera exposure control framework that rapidly controls camera exposure while performing real-time processing by exploiting deep reinforcement learning. The proposed framework consists of four contributions: 1) a simplified training ground to simulate real-world's diverse and dynamic lighting changes 2) flickering and image attribute-aware reward design along with lightweight state design for real-time processing 3) a static-to-dynamic lighting curriculum to gradually improve the agent's exposure-adjusting capability and 4) domain randomization techniques to alleviate the limitation of the training ground and achieve seamless generalization in the wild. As a result our proposed method rapidly reaches a desired exposure level within five steps with real-time processing (1 ms).

Splatter Image is based on Gaussian Splatting which allows fast and high-quality reconstruction of 3D scenes from multiple images. We apply Gaussian Splatting to monocular reconstruction by learning a neural network that at test time performs reconstruction in a feed-forward manner at 38 FPS. Our main innovation is the surprisingly straightforward design of this network which using 2D operators maps the input image to one 3D Gaussian per pixel. The resulting set of Gaussians thus has the form an image the Splatter Image. We further extend the method take several images as input via cross-view attention. Owning to the speed of the renderer (588 FPS) we use a single GPU for training while generating entire images at each iteration to optimize perceptual metrics like LPIPS. On several synthetic real multi-category and large-scale benchmark datasets we achieve better results in terms of PSNR LPIPS and other metrics while training and evaluating much faster than prior works.

    "abstract": "From content moderation to wildlife conservation the number of applications that require models to recognize nuanced or subjective visual concepts is growing. Traditionally developing classifiers for such concepts requires substantial manual effort measured in hours days or even months to identify and annotate data needed for training. Even with recently proposed Agile Modeling techniques which enable rapid bootstrapping of image classifiers users are still required to spend 30 minutes or more of monotonous repetitive data labeling just to train a single classifier. Drawing on Fiske's Cognitive Miser theory we propose a new framework that alleviates manual effort by replacing human labeling with natural language interactions reducing the total effort required to define a concept by an order of magnitude: from labeling 2000 images to only 100 plus some natural language interactions. Our framework leverages recent advances in foundation models both large language models and vision-language models to carve out the concept space through conversation and by automatically labeling training data points. Most importantly our framework eliminates the need for crowd-sourced annotations. Moreover our framework ultimately produces lightweight classification models that are deployable in cost-sensitive scenarios. Across 15 subjective concepts and across 2 public image classification datasets our trained models outperform traditional Agile Modeling as well as state-of-the-art zero-shot classification models like ALIGN CLIP CuPL and large visual question answering models like PaLI-X",

    "abstract": "Backdoor attack poses a significant security threat to Deep Learning applications. Existing attacks are often not evasive to established backdoor detection techniques. This susceptibility primarily stems from the fact that these attacks typically leverage a universal trigger pattern or transformation function such that the trigger can cause misclassification for any input. In response to this recent papers have introduced attacks using sample-specific invisible triggers crafted through special transformation functions. While these approaches manage to evade detection to some extent they reveal vulnerability to existing backdoor mitigation techniques. To address and enhance both evasiveness and resilience we introduce a novel backdoor attack LOTUS. Specifically it leverages a secret function to separate samples in the victim class into a set of partitions and applies unique triggers to different partitions. Furthermore LOTUS incorporates an effective trigger focusing mechanism ensuring only the trigger corresponding to the partition can induce the backdoor behavior. Extensive experimental results show that LOTUS can achieve high attack success rate across 4 datasets and 7 model structures and effectively evading 13 backdoor detection and mitigation techniques.

While there have been striking improvements in image denoising with the emergence of advanced deep learning architectures and real-world datasets recent denoising networks struggle to maintain performance on images with noise that has not been seen during training. One typical approach to address the challenge would be to adapt a denoising network to new noise distribution. Instead in this work we shift our attention to the input noise itself for adaptation rather than adapting a network. Thus we keep a pretrained network frozen and adapt an input noise to capture the fine-grained deviations. As such we propose a new denoising algorithm dubbed Learning-to-Adapt-Noise (LAN) where a learnable noise offset is directly added to a given noisy image to bring a given input noise closer towards the noise distribution a denoising network is trained to handle.

Recently visual foundation models such as Segment Anything (SAM) have gained widespread usage due to their robust zero-shot capabilities and exceptional annotation performance. However SAM's class-agnostic output and high confidence in local segmentation introduce semantic ambiguity posing a challenge for precise category-specific segmentation. In this paper we introduce a cost-effective category-specific segmenter using SAM. To tackle this challenge we have devised a Semantic-Aware Instance Segmentation Network (SAPNet) that integrates Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) with matching capability and SAM with point prompts. SAPNet strategically selects the most representative mask proposals generated by SAM to supervise segmentation with a specific focus on object category information. Moreover we introduce the Point Distance Guidance and Box Mining Strategy to mitigate inherent challenges: group and local issues in weakly supervised segmentation. These strategies serve to further enhance the overall segmentation performance. The experimental results on Pascal VOC and COCO demonstrate the promising performance of our proposed SAPNet emphasizing its semantic matching capabilities and its potential to advance point-prompted instance segmentation.

By learning the whole network in an end-to-end manner so that the GAF is required for predicting the person attributes of people in a group the GAF is trained as the features of multi-person activity. As a person attribute we propose to use a person's action class and appearance features because the former is easy to annotate due to its simpleness and the latter requires no manual annotation. In addition we introduce a location-guided attribute prediction to disentangle the complex GAF for extracting the features of each target person properly. Various experimental results validate that our method outperforms SOTA methods quantitatively and qualitatively on two public datasets. Visualization of our GAF also demonstrates that our method learns the GAF representing fined-grained group activity classes. Code: https://github.com/chihina/GAFL-CVPR2024",

    "abstract": "Human-centric 3D scene understanding has recently drawn increasing attention driven by its critical impact on robotics. However human-centric real-life scenarios are extremely diverse and complicated and humans have intricate motions and interactions. With limited labeled data supervised methods are difficult to generalize to general scenarios hindering real-life applications. Mimicking human intelligence we propose an unsupervised 3D detection method for human-centric scenarios by transferring the knowledge from synthetic human instances to real scenes. To bridge the gap between the distinct data representations and feature distributions of synthetic models and real point clouds we introduce novel modules for effective instance-to-scene representation transfer and synthetic-to-real feature alignment. Remarkably our method exhibits superior performance compared to current state-of-the-art techniques achieving 87.8% improvement in mAP and closely approaching the performance of fully supervised methods (62.15 mAP vs. 69.02 mAP) on HuCenLife Dataset",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Various transfer attack methods have been proposed to evaluate the robustness of deep neural networks (DNNs). Although manifesting remarkable performance in generating untargeted adversarial perturbations existing proposals still fail to achieve high targeted transferability. In this work we discover that the adversarial perturbations' overfitting towards source models of mediocre generalization capability can hurt their targeted transferability. To address this issue we focus on enhancing the source model's generalization capability to improve its ability to conduct transferable targeted adversarial attacks. In pursuit of this goal we propose a novel model self-enhancement method that incorporates two major components: Sharpness-Aware Self-Distillation (SASD) and Weight Scaling (WS). Specifically SASD distills a fine-tuned auxiliary model which mirrors the source model's structure into the source model while flattening the source model's loss landscape. WS obtains an approximate ensemble of numerous pruned models to perform model augmentation which can be conveniently synergized with SASD to elevate the source model's generalization capability and thus improve the resultant targeted perturbations' transferability. Extensive experiments corroborate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Notably under the black-box setting our approach can outperform the state-of-the-art baselines by a significant margin of 12.2% on average in terms of the obtained targeted transferability.

In contrast we tackle the problem of learning to estimate the category-level 3D pose only from casually taken object-centric videos without human supervision. We propose a two-step pipeline: First we introduce a multi-view alignment procedure that determines canonical camera poses across videos with a novel and robust cyclic distance formulation for geometric and appearance matching using reconstructed coarse meshes and DINOv2 features. In a second step the canonical poses and reconstructed meshes enable us to train a model for 3D pose estimation from a single image. In particular our model learns to estimate dense correspondences between images and a prototypical 3D template by predicting for each pixel in a 2D image a feature vector of the corresponding vertex in the template mesh.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Brain decoding a pivotal field in neuroscience aims to reconstruct stimuli from acquired brain signals primarily utilizing functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Currently brain decoding is confined to a per-subject-per-model paradigm limiting its applicability to the same individual for whom the decoding model is trained. This constraint stems from three key challenges: 1) the inherent variability in input dimensions across subjects due to differences in brain size; 2) the unique intrinsic neural patterns influencing how different individuals perceive and process sensory information; 3) limited data availability for new subjects in real-world scenarios hampers the performance of decoding models. In this paper we present a novel approach MindBridge that achieves cross-subject brain decoding by employing only one model. Our proposed framework establishes a generic paradigm capable of addressing these challenges by introducing biological-inspired aggregation function and novel cyclic fMRI reconstruction mechanism for subject-invariant representation learning. Notably by cycle reconstruction of fMRI MindBridge can enable novel fMRI synthesis which also can serve as pseudo data augmentation. Within the framework we also devise a novel reset-tuning method for adapting a pretrained model to a new subject. Experimental results demonstrate MindBridge's ability to reconstruct images for multiple subjects which is competitive with dedicated subject-specific models. Furthermore with limited data for a new subject we achieve a high level of decoding accuracy surpassing that of subject-specific models. This advancement in cross-subject brain decoding suggests promising directions for wider applications in neuroscience and indicates potential for more efficient utilization of limited fMRI data in real-world scenarios.

Thus we design our method to only require 2D RGB data at inference time while being able to generate 3D human motion sequences. We use a differentiable 2D projection scheme in an autoregressive manner for weak supervision and an adversarial loss for 3D regularization. Our method predicts long and complex human behavior sequences (e.g. cooking assembly) consisting of multiple sub-actions. We tackle this in a semantically hierarchical manner jointly predicting high-level coarse action labels together with their low-level fine-grained realizations as characteristic 3D human poses. We observe that these two action representations are coupled in nature and joint prediction benefits both action and pose forecasting.

By selectively masking channels that are less sensitive to lighting conditions adaptive channel masking directs the model to progressively focus on features less affected by variations in light colors and noise.

    "abstract": "Model quantization is widely used to compress and accelerate deep neural networks. However recent studies have revealed the feasibility of weaponizing model quantization via implanting quantization-conditioned backdoors (QCBs). These special backdoors stay dormant on released full-precision models but will come into effect after standard quantization. Due to the peculiarity of QCBs existing defenses have minor effects on reducing their threats or are even infeasible. In this paper we conduct the first in-depth analysis of QCBs. We reveal that the activation of existing QCBs primarily stems from the nearest rounding operation and is closely related to the norms of neuron-wise truncation errors (i.e. the difference between the continuous fullprecision weights and its quantized version). Motivated by these insights we propose Error-guided Flipped Rounding with Activation Preservation (EFRAP) an effective and practical defense against QCBs. Specifically EFRAP learns a non-nearest rounding strategy with neuron-wise error norm and layer-wise activation preservation guidance flipping the rounding strategies of neurons crucial for backdoor effects but with minimal impact on clean accuracy. Extensive evaluations on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our EFRAP can defeat state-of-the-art QCB attacks under various settings. Code is available here",

    "abstract": "Powered by massive curated training data Segment Anything Model (SAM) has demonstrated its impressive generalization capabilities in open-world scenarios with the guidance of prompts. However the vanilla SAM is class-agnostic and heavily relies on user-provided prompts to segment objects of interest. Adapting this method to diverse tasks is crucial for accurate target identification and to avoid suboptimal segmentation results. In this paper we propose a novel framework termed AlignSAM designed for automatic prompting for aligning SAM to an open context through reinforcement learning. Anchored by an agent AlignSAM enables the generality of the SAM model across diverse downstream tasks while keeping its parameters frozen. Specifically AlignSAM initiates a prompting agent to iteratively refine segmentation predictions by interacting with the foundational model. It integrates a reinforcement learning policy network to provide informative prompts to the foundational models. Additionally a semantic recalibration module is introduced to provide fine-grained labels of prompts enhancing the model's proficiency in handling tasks encompassing explicit and implicit semantics. Experiments conducted on various challenging segmentation tasks among existing foundation models demonstrate the superiority of the proposed AlignSAM over state-of-the-art approaches.

In this paper we introduce a simple framework for generalizing semantic segmentation networks by employing language as the source of randomization.

Nevertheless it is not trivial to capitalize on diffusion models for video super-resolution which necessitates not only the preservation of visual appearance from low-resolution to high-resolution videos but also the temporal consistency across video frames. In this paper we propose a novel approach pursuing Spatial Adaptation and Temporal Coherence (SATeCo) for video super-resolution. SATeCo pivots on learning spatial-temporal guidance from low-resolution videos to calibrate both latent-space high-resolution video denoising and pixel-space video reconstruction. Technically SATeCo freezes all the parameters of the pre-trained UNet and VAE and only optimizes two deliberately-designed spatial feature adaptation (SFA) and temporal feature alignment (TFA) modules in the decoder of UNet and VAE. SFA modulates frame features via adaptively estimating affine parameters for each pixel guaranteeing pixel-wise guidance for high-resolution frame synthesis. TFA delves into feature interaction within a 3D local window (tubelet) through self-attention and executes cross-attention between tubelet and its low-resolution counterpart to guide temporal feature alignment.

To bridge this gap in collaboration with the self-driving company May Mobility we present the MARS dataset which unifies scenarios that enable MultiAgent multitraveRSal and multimodal autonomous vehicle research. More specifically MARS is collected with a fleet of autonomous vehicles driving within a certain geographical area. Each vehicle has its own route and different vehicles may appear at nearby locations. Each vehicle is equipped with a LiDAR and surround-view RGB cameras. We curate two subsets in MARS: one facilitates collaborative driving with multiple vehicles simultaneously present at the same location and the other enables memory retrospection through asynchronous traversals of the same location by multiple vehicles. We conduct experiments in place recognition and neural reconstruction. More importantly MARS introduces new research opportunities and challenges such as multitraversal 3D reconstruction multiagent perception and unsupervised object discovery.

Recent work has shown that coupling the two problems by iteratively refining one conditioned on the other's output yields SOTA results across domains. However training these models has proved challenging requiring a litany of tricks to stabilize and speed up training. In this work we take the visual odometry problem as an example and identify three plausible causes: (1) flow loss interference (2) linearization errors in the bundle adjustment (BA) layer and (3) dependence of weight gradients on the BA residual. We show how these issues result in noisy and higher variance gradients potentially leading to a slow down in training and instabilities. We then propose a simple solution to reduce the gradient variance by using the weights predicted by the network in the inner optimization loop to also weight the correspondence objective in the training problem. This helps the training objective 'focus' on the more important points thereby reducing the variance and mitigating the influence of outliers. We show that the resulting method leads to faster training and can be more flexibly trained in varying training setups without sacrificing performance. In particular we show 2-2.5x training speedups over a baseline visual odometry model we modify",

By leveraging the latent space we explicitly uncover noise components allowing for the extraction of a clean latent code. This in turn facilitates the restoration of clean points via inverse transformation. A key component in our network is a new multi-level graph convolution network for capturing rich geometric structural features at various scales from local to global. These features are then integrated into the invertible neural network which bijectively maps the latent space to guide the noise disentanglement process. Additionally we employ an invertible monotone operator to model the transformation process effectively enhancing the representation of integrated geometric features. This enhancement allows our network to precisely differentiate between noise factors and the intrinsic clean points in the latent code by projecting them onto separate channels.

Other approaches resemble the tracking-by-detection paradigm detecting objects using decoupled track and detection queries followed by a subsequent association.

Existing model-based methods have limitations in accurately modeling the complex image characteristics with handcraft priors and deep learning-based methods suffer from poor generalization ability. To alleviate these issues this paper proposes an unsupervised HSI restoration framework with pre-trained diffusion model (HIR-Diff) which restores the clean HSIs from the product of two low-rank components i.e. the reduced image and the coefficient matrix. Specifically the reduced image which has a low spectral dimension lies in the image field and can be inferred from our improved diffusion model where a new guidance function with total variation (TV) prior is designed to ensure that the reduced image can be well sampled. The coefficient matrix can be effectively pre-estimated based on singular value decomposition (SVD) and rank-revealing QR (RRQR) factorization. Furthermore a novel exponential noise schedule is proposed to accelerate the restoration process (about 5xacceleration for denoising) with little performance decrease. Extensive experimental results validate the superiority of our method in both performance and speed on a variety of HSI restoration tasks including HSI denoising noisy HSI super-resolution and noisy HSI inpainting.

    "abstract": "Monocular Depth Estimation (MDE) is a fundamental problem in computer vision with numerous applications. Recently LIDAR-supervised methods have achieved remarkable per-pixel depth accuracy in outdoor scenes. However significant errors are typically found in the proximity of depth discontinuities i.e. depth edges which often hinder the performance of depth-dependent applications that are sensitive to such inaccuracies e.g. novel view synthesis and augmented reality. Since direct supervision for the location of depth edges is typically unavailable in sparse LIDAR-based scenes encouraging the MDE model to produce correct depth edges is not straightforward. To the best of our knowledge this paper is the first attempt to address the depth edges issue for LIDAR-supervised scenes. In this work we propose to learn to detect the location of depth edges from densely-supervised synthetic data and use it to generate supervision for the depth edges in the MDE training. To quantitatively evaluate our approach and due to the lack of depth edges GT in LIDAR-based scenes we manually annotated subsets of the KITTI and the DDAD datasets with depth edges ground truth. We demonstrate significant gains in the accuracy of the depth edges with comparable per-pixel depth accuracy on several challenging datasets.

However this exceptional performance comes at the cost of expensive generation process particularly due to the heavily used attention module in leading models. Existing works mainly adopt a retraining process to enhance DM efficiency. This is computationally expensive and not very scalable. To this end we introduce the Attention-driven Training-free Efficient Diffusion Model (AT-EDM) framework that leverages attention maps to perform run-time pruning of redundant tokens without the need for any retraining. Specifically for single-denoising-step pruning we develop a novel ranking algorithm Generalized Weighted Page Rank (G-WPR) to identify redundant tokens and a similarity-based recovery method to restore tokens for the convolution operation. In addition we propose a Denoising-Steps-Aware Pruning (DSAP) approach to adjust the pruning budget across different denoising timesteps for better generation quality. Extensive evaluations show that AT-EDM performs favorably against prior art in terms of efficiency (e.g. 38.8% FLOPs saving and up to 1.53x speed-up over Stable Diffusion XL) while maintaining nearly the same FID and CLIP scores as the full model",

    "abstract": "Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) is emerging as a flexible and robust technique to adapt models to private users data without training to handle credit attribution and to allow efficient machine unlearning at scale. However RAG techniques for image generation may lead to parts of the retrieved samples being copied in the model's output. To reduce risks of leaking private information contained in the retrieved set we introduce Copy-Protected generation with Retrieval (CPR) a new method for RAG with strong copyright protection guarantees in a mixed-private setting for diffusion models. CPR allows to condition the output of diffusion models on a set of retrieved images while also guaranteeing that unique identifiable information about those example is not exposed in the generated outputs. In particular it does so by sampling from a mixture of public (safe) distribution and private (user) distribution by merging their diffusion scores at inference. We prove that CPR satisfies Near Access Freeness (NAF) which bounds the amount of information an attacker may be able to extract from the generated images. We provide two algorithms for copyright protection CPR-KL and CPR-Choose. Unlike previously proposed rejection-sampling-based NAF methods our methods enable efficient copyright-protected sampling with a single run of backward diffusion. We show that our method can be applied to any pre-trained conditional diffusion model such as Stable Diffusion or unCLIP. In particular we empirically show that applying CPR on top of un- CLIP improves quality and text-to-image alignment of the generated results (81.4 to 83.17 on TIFA benchmark) while enabling credit attribution copy-right protection and deterministic constant time unlearning",

    "abstract": "To serve the intricate and varied demands of image editing precise and flexible manipulation in image content is indispensable. Recently Drag-based editing methods have gained impressive performance. However these methods predominantly center on point dragging resulting in two noteworthy drawbacks namely \"miss tracking\" where difficulties arise in accurately tracking the predetermined handle points and \"ambiguous tracking\" where tracked points are potentially positioned in wrong regions that closely resemble the handle points. To address the above issues we propose FreeDrag a feature dragging methodology designed to free the burden on point tracking. The FreeDrag incorporates two key designs i.e. template feature via adaptive updating and line search with backtracking the former improves the stability against drastic content change by elaborately controlling the feature updating scale after each dragging while the latter alleviates the misguidance from similar points by actively restricting the search area in a line. These two technologies together contribute to a more stable semantic dragging with higher efficiency. Comprehensive experimental results substantiate that our approach significantly outperforms pre-existing methodologies offering reliable point-based editing even in various complex scenarios",

Existing methods have demonstrated that contrastive learning on image-text pairs effectively aligns visual segments with the meanings of texts. We notice that there is a discrepancy between text alignment and semantic segmentation: A text often consists of multiple semantic concepts whereas semantic segmentation strives to create semantically homogeneous segments. To address this issue we propose a novel framework Image-Text Co-Decomposition (CoDe) where the paired image and text are jointly decomposed into a set of image regions and a set of word segments respectively and contrastive learning is developed to enforce region-word alignment. To work with a vision-language model we present a prompt learning mechanism that derives an extra representation to highlight an image segment or a word segment of interest with which more effective features can be extracted from that segment. Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate that our method performs favorably against existing text-supervised semantic segmentation methods on six benchmark datasets",

Beyond regular Continual Learning (CL) attempting to address catastrophic forgetting with offline training of each task Online Continual Learning (OCL) is a more challenging yet realistic setting that performs CL in a one-pass data stream. Current OCL methods primarily rely on memory replay of old training samples. However a notable gap from CL to OCL stems from the additional overfitting-underfitting dilemma associated with the use of rehearsal buffers: the inadequate learning of new training samples (underfitting) and the repeated learning of a few old training samples (overfitting). To this end we introduce a novel approach Multi-level Online Sequential Experts (MOSE) which cultivates the model as stacked sub-experts integrating multi-level supervision and reverse self-distillation. Supervision signals across multiple stages facilitate appropriate convergence of the new task while gathering various strengths from experts by knowledge distillation mitigates the performance decline of old tasks. MOSE demonstrates remarkable efficacy in learning new samples and preserving past knowledge through multi-level experts thereby significantly advancing OCL performance over state-of-the-art baselines (e.g. up to 7.3% on Split CIFAR-100 and 6.1% on Split Tiny-ImageNet)",

We propose a simple zero-shot method for obtaining these illusions from off-the-shelf text-to-image diffusion models. During the reverse diffusion process we estimate the noise from different views of a noisy image and then combine these noise estimates together and denoise the image. A theoretical analysis suggests that this method works precisely for views that can be written as orthogonal transformations of which permutations are a subset. This leads to the idea of a visual anagram ---an image that changes appearance under some rearrangement of pixels. This includes rotations and flips but also more exotic pixel permutations such as a jigsaw rearrangement. Our approach also naturally extends to illusions with more than two views.

To promote the object-level RES task towards finer-grained vision-language understanding we put forward a new multi-granularity referring expression segmentation (MRES) task and construct an evaluation benchmark called RefCOCOm by manual annotations. By employing our automatic model-assisted data engine we build the largest visual grounding dataset namely MRES-32M which comprises over 32.2M high-quality masks and captions on the provided 1M images. Besides a simple yet strong model named UniRES is designed to accomplish the unified object-level and part-level grounding task.

Although diffusion-based generative models have previously demonstrated impressive performance in image generation and object-level 3D generation they have not yet been applied to room-level 3D generation due to their computationally intensive costs. In DiffInDScene we propose a cascaded 3D diffusion pipeline that is efficient and possesses strong generative performance for Truncated Signed Distance Function (TSDF). The whole pipeline is designed to run on a sparse occupancy space in a coarse-to-fine fashion. Inspired by KinectFusion's incremental alignment and fusion of local TSDF volumes we propose a diffusion-based SDF fusion approach that iteratively diffuses and fuses local TSDF volumes facilitating the generation of an entire room environment. The generated results demonstrate that our work is capable to achieve high-quality room generation directly in three-dimensional space starting from scratch. In addition to the scene generation the final part of DiffInDScene can be used as a post-processing module to refine the 3D reconstruction results from multi-view stereo.

Manually annotating medical scans however is expensive and labor-intensive and may not always be available in every domain. Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) is a well-studied technique that alleviates this label-scarcity problem by leveraging available labels from another domain. In this study we introduce Masked Autoencoding and Pseudo-Labeling Segmentation (MAPSeg) a unified UDA framework with great versatility and superior performance for heterogeneous and volumetric medical image segmentation. To the best of our knowledge this is the first study that systematically reviews and develops a framework to tackle four different domain shifts in medical image segmentation. More importantly MAPSeg is the first framework that can be applied to centralized federated and test-time UDA while maintaining comparable performance. We compare MAPSeg with previous state-of-the-art methods on a private infant brain MRI dataset and a public cardiac CT-MRI dataset and MAPSeg outperforms others by a large margin (10.5 Dice improvement on the private MRI dataset and 5.7 on the public CT-MRI dataset).

    "abstract": "Scene Graph Generation (SGG) aims to identify entities and predict the relationship triplets <subject predicate object> in visual scenes. Given the prevalence of large visual variations of subject-object pairs even in the same predicate it can be quite challenging to model and refine predicate representations directly across such pairs which is however a common strategy adopted by most existing SGG methods. We observe that visual variations within the identical triplet are relatively small and certain relation cues are shared in the same type of triplet which can potentially facilitate the relation learning in SGG. Moreover for the long-tail problem widely studied in SGG task it is also crucial to deal with the limited types and quantity of triplets in tail predicates. Accordingly in this paper we propose a Dual-granularity Relation Modeling (DRM) network to leverage fine-grained triplet cues besides the coarse-grained predicate ones. DRM utilizes contexts and semantics of predicate and triplet with Dual-granularity Constraints generating compact and balanced representations from two perspectives to facilitate relation recognition. Furthermore a Dual-granularity Knowledge Transfer (DKT) strategy is introduced to transfer variation from head predicates/triplets to tail ones aiming to enrich the pattern diversity of tail classes to alleviate the long-tail problem.

In response we present a novel direction-aware representation (DaRe) approach that captures scene dynamics from six different directions. This learned representation undergoes an inverse dual-tree complex wavelet transformation (DTCWT) to recover plane-based information. DaReNeRF computes features for each space-time point by fusing vectors from these recovered planes. Combining DaReNeRF with a tiny MLP for color regression and leveraging volume rendering in training yield state-of-the-art performance in novel view synthesis for complex dynamic scenes. Notably to address redundancy introduced by the six real and six imaginary direction-aware wavelet coefficients we introduce a trainable masking approach mitigating storage issues without significant performance decline.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Existing fine-tuning methods for computer vision tasks primarily focus on re-weighting the knowledge learned from the source domain during pre-training. They aim to retain beneficial knowledge for the target domain while suppressing unfavorable knowledge. During the pre-training and fine-tuning stages there is a notable disparity in the data scale. Consequently it is theoretically necessary to employ a model with reduced complexity to mitigate the potential structural risk. However our empirical investigation in this paper reveals that models fine-tuned using existing methods still manifest a high level of model complexity inherited from the pre-training stage leading to a suboptimal stability and generalization ability. This phenomenon indicates an issue that has been overlooked in fine-tuning: Structural Risk Minimization. To address this issue caused by data scale disparity during the fine-tuning stage we propose a simple yet effective approach called Tuning Stable Rank Shrinkage (TSRS). TSRS mitigates the structural risk during the fine-tuning stage by constraining the noise sensitivity of the target model based on stable rank theories. Through extensive experiments we demonstrate that incorporating TSRS into fine-tuning methods leads to improved generalization ability on various tasks regardless of whether the neural networks are based on convolution or transformer architectures. Additionally empirical analysis reveals that TSRS enhances the robustness convexity and smoothness of the loss landscapes in fine-tuned models.

Display photometric stereo which employs a conventional monitor as an illumination source has the potential to overcome limitations often encountered in bulky and difficult-to-use conventional setups. In this paper we present differentiable display photometric stereo (DDPS) addressing an often overlooked challenge in display photometric stereo: the design of display patterns. Departing from using heuristic display patterns DDPS learns the display patterns that yield accurate normal reconstruction for a target system in an end-to-end manner. To this end we propose a differentiable framework that couples basis-illumination image formation with analytic photometric-stereo reconstruction. The differentiable framework facilitates the effective learning of display patterns via auto-differentiation. Also for training supervision we propose to use 3D printing for creating a real-world training dataset enabling accurate reconstruction on the target real-world setup. Finally we exploit that conventional LCD monitors emit polarized light which allows for the optical separation of diffuse and specular reflections when combined with a polarization camera leading to accurate normal reconstruction. Extensive evaluation of DDPS shows improved normal-reconstruction accuracy compared to heuristic patterns and demonstrates compelling properties such as robustness to pattern initialization calibration errors and simplifications in image formation and reconstruction",

In this paper we present a Prior-based Latent Transformation approach (PLTrans) which is specifically designed to learn a degradation-unaware representation thereby allowing the restoration network to effectively generalize to real-world degradation. Toward this end PLTrans learns a degradation-unaware query via a latent diffusion-based regularization module. Furthermore conditioned on the features of a degraded face image a latent dictionary that captures the priors of HQ face images is leveraged to refine the features by mapping the top-d nearest elements. The refined version will be used to build key and value for the cross-attention computation which is tailored to each degraded image and exhibits reduced sensitivity to different degradation factors. Conditioned on the resulting representation we train a decoding network that synthesizes face images with authentic details and identity preservation. Through extensive experiments we verify the effectiveness of the design elements and demonstrate the generalization ability of our proposed approach for both synthetic and unknown degradations.

    "abstract": "Autonomous systems need to process large-scale sparse and irregular point clouds with limited compute resources. Consequently it is essential to develop LiDAR perception methods that are both efficient and effective. Although naively enlarging 3D kernel size can enhance performance it will also lead to a cubically-increasing overhead. Therefore it is crucial to develop streamlined 3D large kernel designs that eliminate redundant weights and work effectively with larger kernels. In this paper we propose an efficient and effective Large Sparse Kernel 3D Neural Network (LSK3DNet) that leverages dynamic pruning to amplify the 3D kernel size. Our method comprises two core components: Spatial-wise Dynamic Sparsity (SDS) and Channel-wise Weight Selection (CWS). SDS dynamically prunes and regrows volumetric weights from the beginning to learn a large sparse 3D kernel. It not only boosts performance but also significantly reduces model size and computational cost. Moreover CWS selects the most important channels for 3D convolution during training and subsequently prunes the redundant channels to accelerate inference for 3D vision tasks. We demonstrate the effectiveness of LSK3DNet on three benchmark datasets and five tracks compared with classical models and large kernel designs. Notably LSK3DNet achieves the state-of-the-art performance on SemanticKITTI (i.e. 75.6% on single-scan and 63.4% on multi-scan) with roughly 40% model size reduction and 60% computing operations reduction compared to the naive large 3D kernel model",

    "abstract": "Annotation ambiguity due to inherent data uncertainties such as blurred boundaries in medical scans and different observer expertise and preferences has become a major obstacle for training deep-learning based medical image segmentation models. To address it the common practice is to gather multiple annotations from different experts leading to the setting of multi-rater medical image segmentation. Existing works aim to either merge different annotations into the \"groundtruth\" that is often unattainable in numerous medical contexts or generate diverse results or produce personalized results corresponding to individual expert raters. Here we bring up a more ambitious goal for multi-rater medical image segmentation i.e. obtaining both diversified and personalized results. Specifically we propose a two-stage framework named D-Persona (first Diversification and then Personalization). In Stage I we exploit multiple given annotations to train a Probabilistic U-Net model with a bound-constrained loss to improve the prediction diversity. In this way a common latent space is constructed in Stage I where different latent codes denote diversified expert opinions. Then in Stage II we design multiple attention-based projection heads to adaptively query the corresponding expert prompts from the shared latent space and then perform the personalized medical image segmentation. We evaluated the proposed model on our in-house Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma dataset and the public lung nodule dataset (i.e. LIDC-IDRI). Extensive experiments demonstrated our D-Persona can provide diversified and personalized results at the same time achieving new SOTA performance for multi-rater medical image segmentation.

Existing manufacturers usually rely on human eye observation to complete PBD which makes it difficult to balance the accuracy and efficiency of detection. To address this issue and drive more attention into this meaningful task we first elaborately collect a dataset called X-ray PBD which has 1500 diverse X-ray images selected from thousands of power batteries of 5 manufacturers with 7 different visual interference. Then we propose a novel segmentation-based solution for PBD termed multi-dimensional collaborative network (MDCNet). With the help of line and counting predictors the representation of the point segmentation branch can be improved at both semantic and detail aspects. Besides we design an effective distance-adaptive mask generation strategy which can alleviate the visual challenge caused by the inconsistent distribution density of plates to provide MDCNet with stable supervision. Without any bells and whistles our segmentation-based MDCNet consistently outperforms various other corner detection crowd counting and general/tiny object detection-based solutions making it a strong baseline that can help facilitate future research in PBD.

We present Audio-Visual Feature Fusion (AVFF) a two-stage cross-modal learning method that explicitly captures the correspondence between the audio and visual modalities for improved deepfake detection. The first stage pursues representation learning via self-supervision on real videos to capture the intrinsic audio-visual correspondences. To extract rich cross-modal representations we use contrastive learning and autoencoding objectives and introduce a novel audio-visual complementary masking and feature fusion strategy. The learned representations are tuned in the second stage where deepfake classification is pursued via supervised learning on both real and fake videos. Extensive experiments and analysis suggest that our novel representation learning paradigm is highly discriminative in nature.

    "abstract": "Machine learning models can perform well on in-distribution data but often fail on biased subgroups that are underrepresented in the training data hindering the robustness of models for reliable applications. Such subgroups are typically unknown due to the absence of subgroup labels. Discovering biased subgroups is the key to understanding models' failure modes and further improving models' robustness. Most previous works of subgroup discovery make an implicit assumption that models only underperform on a single biased subgroup which does not hold on in-the-wild data where multiple biased subgroups exist. In this work we propose Decomposition Interpretation and Mitigation (DIM) a novel method to address a more challenging but also more practical problem of discovering multiple biased subgroups in image classifiers. Our approach decomposes the image features into multiple components that represent multiple subgroups. This decomposition is achieved via a bilinear dimension reduction method Partial Least Square (PLS) guided by useful supervision from the image classifier. We further interpret the semantic meaning of each subgroup component by generating natural language descriptions using vision-language foundation models. Finally DIM mitigates multiple biased subgroups simultaneously via two strategies including the data- and model-centric strategies. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-100 and Breeds datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of DIM in discovering and mitigating multiple biased subgroups. Furthermore DIM uncovers the failure modes of the classifier on Hard ImageNet showcasing its broader applicability to understanding model bias in image classifiers",

To address these challenges we handle ambiguous poses in a generative fashion i.e. sampling from the image-conditioned pose distributions characterized by a diffusion probabilistic model. Specifically with initial pose tokens extracted from the image noisy pose candidates are progressively refined by interacting with the initial tokens via attention layers. Extensive evaluations on the COCO and CrowdPose datasets show that DiffusionRegPose clearly improves the pose accuracy in crowded scenarios as evidenced by a notable 4.0 AP increase in the AP_H metric on the CrowdPose dataset.

To address this limitation we introduce a novel memory-scalable and efficient functional map learning pipeline. By leveraging the specific structure of functional maps we offer the possibility to achieve identical results without ever storing the pointwise map in memory. Furthermore based on the same approach we present a differentiable map refinement layer adapted from an existing axiomatic refinement algorithm.

In this paper we are inspired by the inherent property of the kinematic tree defined in the Skinned Multi-Person Linear (SMPL) model where the upper body and lower body share only one common ancestor node bringing the potential of decoupled reconstruction. We propose a stratified approach to decouple the conventional full-body avatar reconstruction pipeline into two stages with the reconstruction of the upper body first and a subsequent reconstruction of the lower body conditioned on the previous stage. To implement this straightforward idea we leverage the latent diffusion model as a powerful probabilistic generator and train it to follow the latent distribution of decoupled motions explored by a VQ-VAE encoder-decoder model.

In this work we propose the task of weakly-supervised Narration-based Video Object Segmentation (NVOS). Given an egocentric video clip and a narration of the wearer's activities our aim is to segment object instances mentioned in the narration without using any spatial annotations during training. Existing weakly-supervised video object grounding methods typically yield bounding boxes for referred objects. In contrast we propose ROSA a weakly-supervised pixel-level grounding framework learning alignments between referred objects and segmentation mask proposals. Our model harnesses vision-language models pre-trained on image-text pairs to embed region masks and object phrases. During training we combine (a) a video-narration contrastive loss that implicitly supervises the alignment between regions and phrases and (b) a region-phrase contrastive loss based on inferred latent alignments. To address the lack of annotated NVOS datasets in egocentric videos we create a new evaluation benchmark VISOR-NVOS leveraging existing annotations of segmentation masks from VISOR alongside 14.6k newly-collected object-based video clip narrations.

    "abstract": "Recent advancements in large-scale visual-language pre-trained models have led to significant progress in zero-/few-shot anomaly detection within natural image domains. However the substantial domain divergence between natural and medical images limits the effectiveness of these methodologies in medical anomaly detection. This paper introduces a novel lightweight multi-level adaptation and comparison framework to repurpose the CLIP model for medical anomaly detection. Our approach integrates multiple residual adapters into the pre-trained visual encoder enabling a stepwise enhancement of visual features across different levels. This multi-level adaptation is guided by multi-level pixel-wise visual-language feature alignment loss functions which recalibrate the model's focus from object semantics in natural imagery to anomaly identification in medical images. The adapted features exhibit improved generalization across various medical data types even in zero-shot scenarios where the model encounters unseen medical modalities and anatomical regions during training. Our experiments on medical anomaly detection benchmarks demonstrate that our method significantly surpasses current state-of-the-art models with an average AUC improvement of 6.24% and 7.33% for anomaly classification 2.03% and 2.37% for anomaly segmentation under the zero-shot and few-shot settings respectively.

AV-RIR builds on a novel neural codec-based architecture that effectively captures environment geometry and materials properties and solves speech dereverberation as an auxiliary task by using multi-task learning.

As an auxiliary benefit dereverbed speech from AV-RIR shows competitive performance with the state-of-the-art in various spoken language processing tasks and outperforms reverberation time error score in the real-world AVSpeech dataset.

Mainstream solutions mainly focus on learning a single model on large-scale video datasets which struggle to generalize to unseen videos.

In detail we first train a single network to perform both segmentation and depth prediction tasks. This can be effectively learned with our specifically designed depth modulation layer. Then for the TTT process the model is updated by predicting consistent depth maps for the same frame under different data augmentations. In addition we explore different TTT weight update strategies. Our empirical results suggest that the momentum-based weight initialization and looping-based training scheme lead to more stable improvements. Experiments show that the proposed method achieves clear improvements on ZSVOS. Our proposed video TTT strategy provides significant superiority over state-of-the-art TTT methods.

This diverges from the prevalent practice of expanding memory banks to accommodate extensive historical information. Our specially designed \"memory deciphering\" study offers a pivotal insight underpinning such a strategy: expanding memory banks while seemingly beneficial actually increases the difficulty for VOS modules to decode relevant features due to the confusion from redundant information. By restricting memory banks to a limited number of essential frames we achieve a notable improvement in VOS accuracy. This process balances the importance and freshness of frames to maintain an informative memory bank within a bounded capacity. Additionally restricted memory banks reduce the training-inference discrepancy in memory lengths compared with continuous expansion. This fosters new opportunities in temporal reasoning and enables us to introduce the previously overlooked \"temporal positional embedding.\" Finally our insights are embodied in \"RMem\" (\"R\" for restricted) a simple yet effective VOS modification that excels at challenging VOS scenarios and establishes new state of the art for object state changes (VOST dataset) and long videos (the Long Videos dataset).

In this paper we identify a novel security threat towards such a paradigm from the perspective of backdoor attacks. Specifically an extra prompt token called the switch token in this work can turn the backdoor mode on i.e. converting a benign model into a backdoored one. Once under the backdoor mode a specific trigger can force the model to predict a target class. It poses a severe risk to the users of cloud API since the malicious behavior can not be activated and detected under the benign mode thus making the attack very stealthy. To attack a pre-trained model our proposed attack named SWARM learns a trigger and prompt tokens including a switch token. They are optimized with the clean loss which encourages the model always behaves normally even the trigger presents and the backdoor loss that ensures the backdoor can be activated by the trigger when the switch is on. Besides we utilize the cross-mode feature distillation to reduce the effect of the switch token on clean samples. The experiments on diverse visual recognition tasks confirm the success of our switchable backdoor attack i.e. achieving 95%+ attack success rate and also being hard to be detected and removed.

Such methods however lack the ability to jointly detect objects and resolve object associations. In this paper we build on the DETR approach and extend it to the joint detection of objects and their relationships by introducing an approximated bipartite matching. While our method can generalize to an arbitrary number of objects we here focus on the modeling of object pairs and their relations. In particular we apply our method PairDETR to the problem of detecting human bodies and faces and associating them for the same person. Our approach not only eliminates the need for hand-designed post-processing but also achieves excellent results for body-face associations.

To this end we propose a novel plug-and-play anchor enhancement strategy through view correlation for multi-view clustering. Specifically we construct a view graph based on aligned initial anchor graphs to explore inter-view correlations. By learning from view correlation we enhance the anchors of the current view using the relationships between anchors and samples on neighboring views thereby narrowing the spatial distribution of anchors on similar views.

Although there are multiple benchmark datasets available for video frame interpolation in the community none of them is dedicated to human-centric scenarios. To bridge this gap we introduce SportsSloMo a benchmark featuring over 130K high-resolution slow-motion sports video clips totaling over 1M video frames sourced from YouTube. We re-train several state-of-the-art methods on our benchmark and we observed a noticeable decrease in their accuracy compared to other datasets.

    "abstract": "This paper introduces the first text-guided work for generating the sequence of hand-object interaction in 3D. The main challenge arises from the lack of labeled data where existing ground-truth datasets are nowhere near generalizable in interaction type and object category which inhibits the modeling of diverse 3D hand-object interaction with the correct physical implication (e.g. contacts and semantics) from text prompts. To address this challenge we propose to decompose the interaction generation task into two subtasks: hand-object contact generation; and hand-object motion generation. For contact generation a VAE-based network takes as input a text and an object mesh and generates the probability of contacts between the surfaces of hands and the object during the interaction. The network learns a variety of local geometry structure of diverse objects that is independent of the objects' category and thus it is applicable to general objects. For motion generation a Transformer-based diffusion model utilizes this 3D contact map as a strong prior for generating physically plausible hand-object motion as a function of text prompts by learning from the augmented labeled dataset; where we annotate text labels from many existing 3D hand and object motion data. Finally we further introduce a hand refiner module that minimizes the distance between the object surface and hand joints to improve the temporal stability of the object-hand contacts and to suppress the penetration artifacts. In the experiments we demonstrate that our method can generate more realistic and diverse interactions compared to other baseline methods. We also show that our method is applicable to unseen objects. We will release our model and newly labeled data as a strong foundation for future research.

    "abstract": "Deployment of Transformer models on edge devices is becoming increasingly challenging due to the exponentially growing inference cost that scales quadratically with the number of tokens in the input sequence. Token pruning is an emerging solution to address this challenge due to its ease of deployment on various Transformer backbones. However most token pruning methods require computationally expensive fine-tuning which is undesirable in many edge deployment cases. In this work we propose Zero-TPrune the first zero-shot method that considers both the importance and similarity of tokens in performing token pruning. It leverages the attention graph of pre-trained Transformer models to produce an importance distribution for tokens via our proposed Weighted Page Rank (WPR) algorithm. This distribution further guides token partitioning for efficient similarity-based pruning. Due to the elimination of the fine-tuning overhead Zero-TPrune can prune large models at negligible computational cost switch between different pruning configurations at no computational cost and perform hyperparameter tuning efficiently. We evaluate the performance of Zero-TPrune on vision tasks by applying it to various vision Transformer backbones and testing them on ImageNet. Without any fine-tuning Zero-TPrune reduces the FLOPs cost of DeiT-S by 34.7% and improves its throughput by 45.3% with only 0.4% accuracy loss. Compared with state-of-the-art pruning methods that require fine-tuning Zero-TPrune not only eliminates the need for fine-tuning after pruning but also does so with only 0.1% accuracy loss.

We argue that the scarce semantic information conveyed by the one-hot labels hampers the effective knowledge transfer across tasks. In this paper we revisit the role of the classifier head within the CL paradigm and replace the classifier with semantic knowledge from pretrained language models (PLMs). Specifically we use PLMs to generate semantic targets for each class which are frozen and serve as supervision signals during training. Such targets fully consider the semantic correlation between all classes across tasks. Empirical studies show that our approach mitigates forgetting by alleviating representation drifting and facilitating knowledge transfer across tasks. The proposed method is simple to implement and can seamlessly be plugged into existing methods with negligible adjustments. Extensive experiments based on eleven mainstream baselines demonstrate the effectiveness and generalizability of our approach to various protocols. For example under the class-incremental learning setting on ImageNet-100 our method significantly improves the Top-1 accuracy by 3.2% to 6.1% while reducing the forgetting rate by 2.6% to 13.1%",

    "abstract": "The rapid expansion of large-scale text-to-image diffusion models has raised growing concerns regarding their potential misuse in creating harmful or misleading content. In this paper we introduce MACE a finetuning framework for the task of mass concept erasure. This task aims to prevent models from generating images that embody unwanted concepts when prompted. Existing concept erasure methods are typically restricted to handling fewer than five concepts simultaneously and struggle to find a balance between erasing concept synonyms (generality) and maintaining unrelated concepts (specificity). In contrast MACE differs by successfully scaling the erasure scope up to 100 concepts and by achieving an effective balance between generality and specificity. This is achieved by leveraging closed-form cross-attention refinement along with LoRA finetuning collectively eliminating the information of undesirable concepts. Furthermore MACE integrates multiple LoRAs without mutual interference. We conduct extensive evaluations of MACE against prior methods across four different tasks: object erasure celebrity erasure explicit content erasure and artistic style erasure. Our results reveal that MACE surpasses prior methods in all evaluated tasks. Code is available at https://github.com/Shilin-LU/MACE",

    "abstract": "Recently some large kernel convnets strike back with appealing performance and efficiency. However given the square complexity of convolution scaling up kernels can bring about an enormous amount of parameters and the proliferated parameters can induce severe optimization problem. Due to these issues current CNNs compromise to scale up to 51x51 in the form of stripe convolution (i.e. 51x5+5x51) and start to saturate as the kernel size continues growing. In this paper we delve into addressing these vital issues and explore whether we can continue scaling up kernels for more performance gains. Inspired by human vision we propose a human-like peripheral convolution that efficiently reduces over 90% parameter count of dense grid convolution through parameter sharing and manage to scale up kernel size to extremely large. Our peripheral convolution behaves highly similar to human reducing the complexity of convolution from O(K^2) to O(logK) without backfiring performance. Built on this we propose Parameter-efficient Large Kernel Network (PeLK). Our PeLK outperforms modern vision Transformers and ConvNet architectures like Swin ConvNeXt RepLKNet and SLaK on various vision tasks including ImageNet classification semantic segmentation on ADE20K and object detection on MS COCO. For the first time we successfully scale up the kernel size of CNNs to an unprecedented 101x101 and demonstrate consistent improvements",

    "abstract": "Expressive human pose and shape estimation (a.k.a. 3D whole-body mesh recovery) involves the human body hand and expression estimation. Most existing methods have tackled this task in a two-stage manner first detecting the human body part with an off-the-shelf detection model and then inferring the different human body parts individually. Despite the impressive results achieved these methods suffer from 1) loss of valuable contextual information via cropping 2) introducing distractions and 3) lacking inter-association among different persons and body parts inevitably causing performance degradation especially for crowded scenes. To address these issues we introduce a novel all-in-one-stage framework AiOS for multiple expressive human pose and shape recovery without an additional human detection step. Specifically our method is built upon DETR which treats multi-person whole-body mesh recovery task as a progressive set prediction problem with various sequential detection. We devise the decoder tokens and extend them to our task. Specifically we first employ a human token to probe a human location in the image and encode global features for each instance which provides a coarse location for the later transformer block. Then we introduce a joint-related token to probe the human joint in the image and encoder a fine-grained local feature which collaborates with the global feature to regress the whole-body mesh. This straightforward but effective model outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods by a 9 reduction in NMVE on AGORA a 30 reduction in PVE on EHF a 10 reduction in PVE on ARCTIC and a 3 reduction in PVE on EgoBody",

However existing video reasoning benchmarks are still inadequate since they were mainly designed for factual or situated reasoning and rarely involve broader knowledge in the real world. Our work aims to delve deeper into reasoning evaluations specifically within dynamic open-world and structured context knowledge. We propose a new benchmark (SOK-Bench) consisting of 44K questions and 10K situations with instance-level annotations depicted in the videos. The reasoning process is required to understand and apply situated knowledge and general knowledge for problem-solving. To create such a dataset we propose an automatic and scalable generation method to generate question-answer pairs knowledge graphs and rationales by instructing the combinations of LLMs and MLLMs. Concretely we first extract observable situated entities relations and processes from videos for situated knowledge and then extend to open-world knowledge beyond the visible content. The task generation is facilitated through multiple dialogues as iterations and subsequently corrected and refined by our designed self-promptings and demonstrations. With a corpus of both explicit situated facts and implicit commonsense we generate associated question-answer pairs and reasoning processes finally followed by manual reviews for quality assurance.

We validate our method by applying it to the stacked decoders of a query- based object detector and conduct extensive experiments on the widely used MS COCO dataset.

    "abstract": "Scene text recognition (STR) in the wild frequently encounters challenges when coping with domain variations font diversity shape deformations etc. A straightforward solution is performing model fine-tuning tailored to a specific scenario but it is computationally intensive and requires multiple model copies for various scenarios. Recent studies indicate that large language models (LLMs) can learn from a few demonstration examples in a training-free manner termed \"In-Context Learning\" (ICL). Nevertheless applying LLMs as a text recognizer is unacceptably resource-consuming. Moreover our pilot experiments on LLMs show that ICL fails in STR mainly attributed to the insufficient incorporation of contextual information from diverse samples in the training stage. To this end we introduce E2STR a STR model trained with context-rich scene text sequences where the sequences are generated via our proposed in-context training strategy. E2STR demonstrates that a regular-sized model is sufficient to achieve effective ICL capabilities in STR. Extensive experiments show that E2STR exhibits remarkable training-free adaptation in various scenarios and outperforms even the fine-tuned state-of-the-art approaches on public benchmarks.

Our method involves thinking outside the box literally! We go outside the object bounding box to use its context to guide a pre-trained diffusion inpainting model and then progressively grow the occluded object and trim the extra background. We overcome two technical challenges: 1) how to be free of unwanted co-occurrence bias which tends to regenerate similar occluders and 2) how to judge if an amodal completion has succeeded. Our amodal completion method exhibits improved photorealistic completion results compared to existing approaches in numerous successful completion cases. And the best part?

Specifically the proposed reward function denoted as Diversity Reward utilizes a set of generated images to evaluate the coverage of the current generative distribution w.r.t. the reference distribution represented by a set of unbiased images. Built on top of the probabilistic method of distribution discrepancy estimation Diversity Reward can measure the relative distribution gap with a small set of images efficiently. We further formulate the diffusion process as a multi-step decision-making problem (MDP) and apply policy gradient methods to fine-tune diffusion models by maximizing the Diversity Reward. The proposed rewards are validated on a post-sampling selection task where a subset of the most diverse images are selected based on Diversity Reward values.

Our method distills diffusion features from image foundational models onto input shapes. Specifically we use the input shapes to produce depth and normal maps as guidance for conditional image synthesis. In the process we produce (diffusion) features in 2D that we subsequently lift and aggregate on the original surface. Our key observation is that even if the conditional image generations obtained from multi-view rendering of the input shapes are inconsistent the associated image features are robust and hence can be directly aggregated across views. This produces semantic features on the input shapes without requiring additional data or training. We perform extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks (SHREC'19 SHREC'20 FAUST and TOSCA) and demonstrate that our features being semantic instead of geometric produce reliable correspondence across both isometric and non-isometrically related shape families.

Traditional simulators relying on heuristic models often fail to deliver accurate simulations due to the complexity of real-world traffic environments. Due to the covariate shift issue existing imitation learning-based simulators often fail to generate stable long-term simulations. In this paper we propose a novel approach called learner-aware supervised imitation learning to address the covariate shift problem in multi-agent imitation learning.

    "abstract": "Federated Learning (FL) facilitates clients to collaborate on training a shared machine learning model without exposing individual private data. Nonetheless FL remains susceptible to utility and privacy attacks notably evasion data poisoning and model inversion attacks compromising the system's efficiency and data privacy. Existing FL defenses are often specialized to a particular single attack lacking generality and a comprehensive defender's perspective. To address these challenges we introduce Federated Cryptography Defense (FCD) a unified single framework aligning with the defender's perspective. FCD employs row-wise transposition cipher based data encryption with a secret key to counter both evasion black-box data poisoning and model inversion attacks. The crux of FCD lies in transferring the entire learning process into an encrypted data space and using a novel distillation loss guided by the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence. This measure compares the probability distributions of the local pretrained teacher model's predictions on normal data and the local student model's predictions on the same data in FCD's encrypted form. By working within this encrypted space FCD eliminates the need for decryption at the server resulting in reduced computational complexity. We demonstrate the practical feasibility of FCD and apply it to defend against evasion utility attack on benchmark datasets (GTSRB KBTS CIFAR10 and EMNIST). We further extend FCD for defending against model inversion attack in split FL on the CIFAR100 dataset. Our experiments across the diverse attack and FL settings demonstrate practical feasibility and robustness against utility evasion (impact >30) and privacy attacks (MSE >73) compared to the second best method",

    "abstract": "Deep learning-based methods have achieved significant successes on solving the blind super-resolution (BSR) problem. However most of them request supervised pre-training on labelled datasets. This paper proposes an unsupervised kernel estimation model named dynamic kernel prior (DKP) to realize an unsupervised and pre-training-free learning-based algorithm for solving the BSR problem. DKP can adaptively learn dynamic kernel priors to realize real-time kernel estimation and thereby enables superior HR image restoration performances. This is achieved by a Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling process on random kernel distributions. The learned kernel prior is then assigned to optimize a blur kernel estimation network which entails a network-based Langevin dynamic optimization strategy. These two techniques ensure the accuracy of the kernel estimation. DKP can be easily used to replace the kernel estimation models in the existing methods such as Double-DIP and FKP-DIP or be added to the off-the-shelf image restoration model such as diffusion model. In this paper we incorporate our DKP model with DIP and diffusion model referring to DIP-DKP and Diff-DKP for validations. Extensive simulations on Gaussian and motion kernel scenarios demonstrate that the proposed DKP model can significantly improve the kernel estimation with comparable runtime and memory usage leading to state-of-the-art BSR results.

    "abstract": "In the evolving landscape of digital media and video production the precise manipulation and reproduction of visual elements like camera movements and character actions are highly desired. Existing SLAM methods face limitations in dynamic scenes and human pose estimation often focuses on 2D projections neglecting 3D statuses. To address these issues we first introduce a reverse filming behavior estimation technique. It optimizes camera trajectories by leveraging NeRF as a differentiable renderer and refining SMPL tracks. We then introduce a cinematic transfer pipeline that is able to transfer various shot types to a new 2D video or a 3D virtual environment. The incorporation of 3D engine workflow enables superior rendering and control abilities which also achieves a higher rating in the user study",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Monocular 3D detectors achieve remarkable performance on cars and smaller objects. However their performance drops on larger objects leading to fatal accidents. Some attribute the failures to training data scarcity or the receptive field requirements of large objects. In this paper we highlight this understudied problem of generalization to large objects. We find that modern frontal detectors struggle to generalize to large objects even on nearly balanced datasets. We argue that the cause of failure is the sensitivity of depth regression losses to noise of larger objects. To bridge this gap we comprehensively investigate regression and dice losses examining their robustness under varying error levels and object sizes. We mathematically prove that the dice loss leads to superior noise-robustness and model convergence for large objects compared to regression losses for a simplified case. Leveraging our theoretical insights we propose SeaBird (Segmentation in Bird's View) as the first step towards generalizing to large objects. SeaBird effectively integrates BEV segmentation on foreground objects for 3D detection with the segmentation head trained with the dice loss. SeaBird achieves SoTA results on the KITTI-360 leaderboard and improves existing detectors on the nuScenes leaderboard particularly for large objects",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Despite their exceptional generative abilities large T2I diffusion models much like skilled but careless artists often struggle with accurately depicting visual relationships between objects. This issue as we uncover through careful analysis arises from a misaligned text encoder that struggles to interpret specific relationships and differentiate the logical order of associated objects. To resolve this we introduce a novel task termed Relation Rectification aiming to refine the model to accurately represent a given relationship it initially fails to generate. To address this we propose an innovative solution utilizing a Heterogeneous Graph Convolutional Network (HGCN). It models the directional relationships between relation terms and corresponding objects within the input prompts. Specifically we optimize the HGCN on a pair of prompts with identical relational words but reversed object orders supplemented by a few reference images. The lightweight HGCN adjusts the text embeddings generated by the text encoder ensuring accurate reflection of the textual relation in the embedding space. Crucially our method retains the parameters of the text encoder and diffusion model preserving the model's robust performance on unrelated descriptions. We validated our approach on a newly curated dataset of diverse relational data demonstrating both quantitative and qualitative enhancements in generating images with precise visual relations.

    "abstract": "Sampling from diffusion models can be treated as solving the corresponding ordinary differential equations (ODEs) with the aim of obtaining an accurate solution with as few number of function evaluations (NFE) as possible. Recently various fast samplers utilizing higher-order ODE solvers have emerged and achieved better performance than the initial first-order one. However these numerical methods inherently result in certain approximation errors which significantly degrades sample quality with extremely small NFE (e.g. around 5). In contrast based on the geometric observation that each sampling trajectory almost lies in a two-dimensional subspace embedded in the ambient space we propose Approximate MEan-Direction Solver (AMED-Solver) that eliminates truncation errors by directly learning the mean direction for fast diffusion sampling. Besides our method can be easily used as a plugin to further improve existing ODE-based samplers. Extensive experiments on image synthesis with the resolution ranging from 32 to 512 demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.

We build upon the insight---web developers tend to arrange task-related elements nearby on webpages to enhance user experiences---and propose to contextualize each element with its neighbor elements using both textual and visual features. The resulting representations of HTML elements are more informative for the agent to take action.

Prior approaches to leverage such data mainly consider the application of uni-modal noisy label learning without amending the impact on both cross-modal and intra-modal geometrical structures in multimodal learning. Actually we find that both structures are effective to discriminate noisy correspondence through structural differences when being well-established. Inspired by this observation we introduce a Geometrical Structure Consistency (GSC) method to infer the true correspondence. Specifically GSC ensures the preservation of geometrical structures within and between modalities allowing for the accurate discrimination of noisy samples based on structural differences. Utilizing these inferred true correspondence labels GSC refines the learning of geometrical structures by filtering out the noisy samples.

Our key idea is to perform in-context concept learning acquiring the local visual concept within the broader context of the objects they belong to. To localize the concept learning we employ soft masks that contain both the concept within the mask and the surrounding image area.

This masking mechanism inspires an efficient method -- one-shot sampling -- to simultaneously sample tokens of multiple labels in parallel and rank generated labels by their probabilities during inference. To further enhance the efficiency we propose a simple strategy to construct a compact decoder by simply discarding the intermediate blocks of a pretrained language model.

Recent progress in deep quality-fitting-based methods that train models to align with quality anchors has shown promise in FIQA. However these methods heavily depend on a recognition model to yield quality anchors and indiscriminately treat the confidence of inaccurate anchors as equivalent to that of accurate ones during the FIQA model training leading to a fitting bottleneck issue. This paper seeks a solution by putting forward the Confidence-Calibrated Face Image Quality Assessment (CLIB-FIQA) approach underpinned by the synergistic interplay between the quality anchors and objective quality factors such as blur pose expression occlusion and illumination. Specifically we devise a joint learning framework built upon the vision-language alignment model which leverages the joint distribution with multiple quality factors to facilitate the quality fitting of the FIQA model. Furthermore to alleviate the issue of the model placing excessive trust in inaccurate quality anchors we propose a confidence calibration method to correct the quality distribution by exploiting to the fullest extent of these objective quality factors characterized as the merged-factor distribution during training.

Existing approaches typically approximate the continuous pose representation with a large number of discrete pose hypotheses which incurs a computationally expensive process of scoring each hypothesis at test time. By contrast we present a Deep Voxel Matching Network (DVMNet) that eliminates the need for pose hypotheses and computes the relative object pose in a single pass. To this end we map the two input RGB images reference and query to their respective voxelized 3D representations. We then pass the resulting voxels through a pose estimation module where the voxels are aligned and the pose is computed in an end-to-end fashion by solving a least-squares problem. To enhance robustness we introduce a weighted closest voxel algorithm capable of mitigating the impact of noisy voxels.

TANGLE was pre-trained on samples from three different organs: liver (n=6597 S+E pairs) breast (n=1020) and lung (n=1012) from two different species (Homo sapiens and Rattus norvegicus). Across three independent test datasets consisting of 1265 breast WSIs 1946 lung WSIs and 4584 liver WSIs TANGLE shows significantly better few-shot performance compared to supervised and SSL baselines. When assessed using prototype-based classification and slide retrieval TANGLE also shows a substantial performance improvement over all baselines.

    "abstract": "Diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in generating high-quality diverse and creative images. However in text-based image generation they often struggle to accurately capture the intended meaning of the text. For instance a specified object might not be generated or an adjective might incorrectly alter unintended objects. Moreover we found that relationships indicating possession between objects are frequently overlooked. Despite the diversity of users' intentions in text existing methods often focus on only some aspects of these intentions. In this paper we propose Predicated Diffusion a unified framework designed to more effectively express users' intentions. It represents the intended meaning as propositions using predicate logic and treats the pixels in attention maps as fuzzy predicates. This approach provides a differentiable loss function that offers guidance for the image generation process to better fulfill the propositions. Comparative evaluations with existing methods demonstrated that Predicated Diffusion excels in generating images faithful to various text prompts while maintaining high image quality as validated by human evaluators and pretrained image-text models",

To tackle this challenge we propose CLOVA a Closed-Loop Visual Assistant which operates within a framework encompassing inference reflection and learning phases. During the inference phase LLMs generate programs and execute corresponding tools to complete assigned tasks. In the reflection phase a multimodal global-local reflection scheme analyzes human feedback to determine which tools require updating. Lastly the learning phase employs three flexible approaches to automatically gather training data and introduces a novel prompt tuning scheme to update the tools allowing CLOVA to efficiently acquire new knowledge. Experimental findings demonstrate that CLOVA surpasses existing tool-usage methods by 5% in visual question answering and multiple-image reasoning by 10% in knowledge tagging and by 20% in image editing.

    "abstract": "Dense depth maps have been used as a key element of visual perception tasks. There have been tremendous efforts to enhance the depth quality ranging from optimization-based to learning-based methods. Despite the remarkable progress for a long time their applicability in the real world is limited due to systematic measurement biases such as density sensing pattern and scan range. It is well-known that the biases make it difficult for these methods to achieve their generalization. We observe that learning a joint representation for input modalities (e.g. images and depth) which most recent methods adopt is sensitive to the biases. In this work we disentangle those modalities to mitigate the biases with prompt engineering. For this we design a novel depth prompt module to allow the desirable feature representation according to new depth distributions from either sensor types or scene configurations. Our depth prompt can be embedded into foundation models for monocular depth estimation. Through this embedding process our method helps the pretrained model to be free from restraint of depth scan range and to provide absolute scale depth maps.

However a significant gap appears when it comes to the application field as current models are all trained offline with fixed parameters that are inherently suboptimal to handle the complex yet ever-changing nature of human behaviors. To bridge this gap in this paper we introduce the task of online meta adaptation for human motion prediction based on the insight that finding \"smart weights\" capable of swift adjustments to suit different motion contexts along the time is a key to improving predictive accuracy. We propose MoML which ingeniously borrows the bilevel optimization spirit of model-agnostic meta-learning to transform previous predictive mistakes into strong inductive biases to guide online adaptation. This is achieved by our MoAdapter blocks that can learn error information by facilitating efficient adaptation via a few gradient steps which fine-tunes our meta-learned \"smart\" initialization produced by the generic predictor. Considering real-time requirements in practice we further propose Fast-MoML a more efficient variant of MoML that features a closed-form solution instead of conventional gradient update. Experimental results show that our approach can effectively bring many existing offline motion prediction models online and improves their predictive accuracy",

In this paper we propose Controllable Accelerated virtual Try-on with Diffusion Model (CAT-DM). To enhance the controllability a basic diffusion-based virtual try-on network is designed which utilizes ControlNet to introduce additional control conditions and improves the feature extraction of garment images. In terms of acceleration CAT-DM initiates a reverse denoising process with an implicit distribution generated by a pre-trained GAN-based model. Compared with previous try-on methods based on diffusion models CAT-DM not only retains the pattern and texture details of the in-shop garment but also reduces the sampling steps without compromising generation quality.

Although a non-parametric classifier may provide better metric space utilization it introduces the challenge of capturing inter-class relationships. A shared characteristic among prior non-parametric classifiers is the static assignment of labels to prototypes during the training i.e. each prototype consistently represents a class throughout the training course. Orthogonal to previous works we present a simple yet effective method to optimize the category assigned to each prototype (label-to-prototype assignment) during the training. To this aim we formalize the problem as a two-step optimization objective over network parameters and label-to-prototype assignment mapping. We solve this optimization using a sequential combination of gradient descent and Bipartide matching. We demonstrate the benefits of the proposed approach by conducting experiments on balanced and long-tail classification problems using different backbone network architectures. In particular our method outperforms its competitors by 1.22% accuracy on CIFAR-100 and 2.15% on ImageNet-200 using a metric space dimension half of the size of its competitors. \\href https://github.com/msed-Ebrahimi/DL2PA_CVPR24 Code",

Indeed recent work on semantic segmentation reports improved accuracy from supervised training leveraging hierarchical label structures. Encouraged by these results we revisit the fundamental assumptions behind that work. We postulate and then empirically verify that the reasons for the observed improvement in segmentation accuracy may be entirely unrelated to the use of the semantic hierarchy. To demonstrate this we design a range of cross-domain experiments with a representative hierarchical approach. We find that on the new testing domains a flat (non-hierarchical) segmentation network in which the parents are inferred from the children has superior segmentation accuracy to the hierarchical approach across the board. Complementing these findings and inspired by the intrinsic properties of hyperbolic spaces we study a more principled approach to hierarchical segmentation using the Poincare ball model. The hyperbolic representation largely outperforms the previous (Euclidean) hierarchical approach as well and is on par with our flat Euclidean baseline in terms of segmentation accuracy. However it additionally exhibits surprisingly strong calibration quality of the parent nodes in the semantic hierarchy especially on the more challenging domains. Our combined analysis suggests that the established practice of hierarchical segmentation may be limited to in-domain settings whereas flat classifiers generalize substantially better especially if they are modeled in the hyperbolic space",

    "abstract": "Predicting the future motion of surrounding agents is essential for autonomous vehicles (AVs) to operate safely in dynamic human-robot-mixed environments. Context information such as road maps and surrounding agents' states provides crucial geometric and semantic information for motion behavior prediction. To this end recent works explore two-stage prediction frameworks where coarse trajectories are first proposed and then used to select critical context information for trajectory refinement. However they either incur a large amount of computation or bring limited improvement if not both. In this paper we introduce a novel scenario-adaptive refinement strategy named SmartRefine to refine prediction with minimal additional computation. Specifically SmartRefine can comprehensively adapt refinement configurations based on each scenario's properties and smartly chooses the number of refinement iterations by introducing a quality score to measure the prediction quality and remaining refinement potential of each scenario. SmartRefine is designed as a generic and flexible approach that can be seamlessly integrated into most state-of-the-art motion prediction models. Experiments on Argoverse (1 & 2) show that our method consistently improves the prediction accuracy of multiple state-of-the-art prediction models. Specifically by adding SmartRefine to QCNet we outperform all published ensemble-free works on the Argoverse 2 leaderboard (single agent track) at submission. Comprehensive studies are also conducted to ablate design choices and explore the mechanism behind multi-iteration refinement. Codes are available at https://github.com/opendilab/SmartRefine/",

However most benchmarks predominantly assess spatial understanding in the static image tasks while overlooking temporal understanding in the dynamic video tasks. To alleviate this issue we introduce a comprehensive Multi-modal Video understanding Benchmark namely MVBench which covers 20 challenging video tasks that cannot be effectively solved with a single frame. Specifically we first introduce a novel static-to-dynamic method to define these temporal-related tasks. By transforming various static tasks into dynamic ones we enable the systematic generation of video tasks that require a broad spectrum of temporal skills ranging from perception to cognition. Then guided by the task definition we automatically convert public video annotations into multiple-choice QA to evaluate each task. On one hand such a distinct paradigm allows us to build MVBench efficiently without much manual intervention. On the other hand it guarantees evaluation fairness with ground-truth video annotations avoiding the biased scoring of LLMs. Moreover we further develop a robust video MLLM baseline i.e. VideoChat2 by progressive multi-modal training with diverse instruction-tuning data.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "ecent progress in video anomaly detection suggests that the features of appearance and motion play crucial roles in distinguishing abnormal patterns from normal ones. However we note that the effect of spatial scales of anomalies is ignored. The fact that many abnormal events occur in limited localized regions and severe background noise interferes with the learning of anomalous changes. Meanwhile most existing methods are limited by coarse-grained modeling approaches which are inadequate for learning highly discriminative features to discriminate subtle differences between small-scale anomalies and normal patterns. To this end this paper address multi-scale video anomaly detection by multi-grained spatio-temporal representation learning. We utilize video continuity to design three proxy tasks to perform feature learning at both coarse-grained and fine-grained levels i.e. continuity judgment discontinuity localization and missing frame estimation. In particular we formulate missing frame estimation as a contrastive learning task in feature space instead of a reconstruction task in RGB space to learn highly discriminative features. Experiments show that our proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art methods on four datasets especially in scenes with small-scale anomalies",

Traditional FL methods adopt an aggregate-then-adapt framework where clients update local models based on a global model aggregated by the server from the previous training round.

To address these challenges we introduce FedAF a novel aggregation-free FL algorithm. In this framework clients collaboratively learn condensed data by leveraging peer knowledge the server subsequently trains the global model using the condensed data and soft labels received from the clients. FedAF inherently avoids the issue of client drift enhances the quality of condensed data amid notable data heterogeneity and improves the global model performance. Extensive numerical studies on several popular benchmark datasets show FedAF surpasses various state-of-the-art FL algorithms in handling label-skew and feature-skew data heterogeneity leading to superior global model accuracy and faster convergence",

We refine pseudo-labels using intra-set correlations within each geometric consistency set and align features of visually and geometrically similar points using intra-scene and inter-scene correlation learning. We also introduce a feedback mechanism to distill the correlation learning capability into the 3D model. Experiments on both indoor and outdoor datasets show the superiority of our method.

However the existing MIL paradigm typically requires an offline instance feature extractor such as a pre-trained ResNet or a foundation model. This approach lacks the capability for feature fine-tuning within the specific downstream tasks limiting its adaptability and performance. To address this issue we propose a Re-embedded Regional Transformer (RRT) for re-embedding the instance features online which captures fine-grained local features and establishes connections across different regions. Unlike existing works that focus on pre-training powerful feature extractor or designing sophisticated instance aggregator RRT is tailored to re-embed instance features online. It serves as a portable module that can seamlessly integrate into mainstream MIL models. Extensive experimental results on common computational pathology tasks validate that: 1) feature re-embedding improves the performance of MIL models based on ResNet-50 features to the level of foundation model features and further enhances the performance of foundation model features; 2) the RRT can introduce more significant performance improvements to various MIL models; 3) RRT-MIL as an RRT-enhanced AB-MIL outperforms other latest methods by a large margin.

    "abstract": "This research focuses on the issue of single-image reflection removal (SIRR) in real-world conditions examining it from two angles: the collection pipeline of real reflection pairs and the perception of real reflection locations. We devise an advanced reflection collection pipeline that is highly adaptable to a wide range of real-world reflection scenarios and incurs reduced costs in collecting large-scale aligned reflection pairs. In the process we develop a large-scale high-quality reflection dataset named Reflection Removal in the Wild (RRW). RRW contains over 14950 high-resolution real-world reflection pairs a dataset forty-five times larger than its predecessors. Regarding perception of reflection locations we identify that numerous virtual reflection objects visible in reflection images are not present in the corresponding ground-truth images. This observation drawn from the aligned pairs leads us to conceive the Maximum Reflection Filter (MaxRF). The MaxRF could accurately and explicitly characterize reflection locations from pairs of images. Building upon this we design a reflection location-aware cascaded framework specifically tailored for SIRR. Powered by these innovative techniques our solution achieves superior performance than current leading methods across multiple real-world benchmarks.

However existing methods struggle to reconstruct faces with extreme expressions due to deficiencies in supervisory signals such as sparse or inaccurate landmarks. Segmentation information contains effective geometric contexts for face reconstruction. Certain attempts intuitively depend on differentiable renderers to compare the rendered silhouettes of reconstruction with segmentation which is prone to issues like local optima and gradient instability. In this paper we fully utilize the facial part segmentation geometry by introducing Part Re-projection Distance Loss (PRDL). Specifically PRDL transforms facial part segmentation into 2D points and re-projects the reconstruction onto the image plane. Subsequently by introducing grid anchors and computing different statistical distances from these anchors to the point sets PRDL establishes geometry descriptors to optimize the distribution of the point sets for face reconstruction. PRDL exhibits a clear gradient compared to the renderer-based methods and presents state-of-the-art reconstruction performance in extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments.

We initially investigate the key contributions of the U-Net architecture to the denoising process and identify that its main backbone primarily contributes to denoising whereas its skip connections mainly introduce high-frequency features into the decoder module causing the potential neglect of crucial functions intrinsic to the backbone network. Capitalizing on this discovery we propose a simple yet effective method termed \"FreeU\" which enhances generation quality without additional training or finetuning. Our key insight is to strategically re-weight the contributions sourced from the U-Net's skip connections and backbone feature maps to leverage the strengths of both components of the U-Net architecture. Promising results on image and video generation tasks demonstrate that our FreeU can be readily integrated to existing diffusion models e.g. Stable Diffusion DreamBooth and ControlNet to improve the generation quality with only a few lines of code.

    "abstract": "Weakly supervised video anomaly detection (WSVAD) is a challenging task. Generating fine-grained pseudo-labels based on weak-label and then self-training a classifier is currently a promising solution. However since the existing methods use only RGB visual modality and the utilization of category text information is neglected thus limiting the generation of more accurate pseudo-labels and affecting the performance of self-training. Inspired by the manual labeling process based on the event description in this paper we propose a novel pseudo-label generation and self-training framework based on Text Prompt with Normality Guidance (TPWNG) for WSVAD. Our idea is to transfer the rich language-visual knowledge of the contrastive language-image pre-training (CLIP) model for aligning the video event description text and corresponding video frames to generate pseudo-labels. Specifically We first fine-tune the CLIP for domain adaptation by designing two ranking losses and a distributional inconsistency loss. Further we propose a learnable text prompt mechanism with the assist of a normality visual prompt to further improve the matching accuracy of video event description text and video frames. Then we design a pseudo-label generation module based on the normality guidance to infer reliable frame-level pseudo-labels. Finally we introduce a temporal context self-adaptive learning module to learn the temporal dependencies of different video events more flexibly and accurately.

However operating on dense latent spaces introduces a cubic time and space complexity which limits scalability in terms of perception range or spatial resolution.

Although efficient these projections result in information loss especially for tasks like semantic occupancy prediction. To address this we propose SparseOcc an efficient occupancy network inspired by sparse point cloud processing. It utilizes a lossless sparse latent representation with three key innovations. Firstly a 3D sparse diffuser performs latent completion using spatially decomposed 3D sparse convolutional kernels. Secondly a feature pyramid and sparse interpolation enhance scales with information from others. Finally the transformer head is redesigned as a sparse variant. SparseOcc achieves a remarkable 74.9% reduction on FLOPs over the dense baseline.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "While super-resolution (SR) methods based on diffusion models exhibit promising results their practical application is hindered by the substantial number of required inference steps. Recent methods utilize the degraded images in the initial state thereby shortening the Markov chain. Nevertheless these solutions either rely on a precise formulation of the degradation process or still necessitate a relatively lengthy generation path (e.g. 15 iterations). To enhance inference speed we propose a simple yet effective method for achieving single-step SR generation named SinSR. Specifically we first derive a deterministic sampling process from the most recent state-of-the-art (SOTA) method for accelerating diffusion-based SR. This allows the mapping between the input random noise and the generated high-resolution image to be obtained in a reduced and acceptable number of inference steps during training. We show that this deterministic mapping can be distilled into a student model that performs SR within only one inference step. Additionally we propose a novel consistency-preserving loss to simultaneously leverage the ground-truth image during the distillation process ensuring that the performance of the student model is not solely bound by the feature manifold of the teacher model resulting in further performance improvement. Extensive experiments conducted on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed method can achieve comparable or even superior performance compared to both previous SOTA methods and the teacher model in just one sampling step resulting in a remarkable up to x10 speedup for inference.

Prior methods directly model the motion field from the Eulerian perspective by Representation Learning that separates shape and texture or Multi-domain Learning from phase fluctuations. Inspired by the frequency spectrum we observe that the low-frequency components with stable energy always possess spatial structure and less noise making them suitable for modeling the subtle motion field. To this end we present FD4MM a new paradigm of Frequency Decoupling for Motion Magnification with a Multi-level Isomorphic Architecture to capture multi-level high-frequency details and a stable low-frequency structure (motion field) in video space. Since high-frequency details and subtle motions are susceptible to information degradation due to their inherent subtlety and unavoidable external interference from noise we carefully design Sparse High/Low-pass Filters to enhance the integrity of details and motion structures and a Sparse Frequency Mixer to promote seamless recoupling. Besides we innovatively design a contrastive regularization for this task to strengthen the model's ability to discriminate irrelevant features reducing undesired motion magnification. Extensive experiments on both Real-world and Synthetic Datasets show that our FD4MM outperforms SOTA methods.

Semi-supervised learning and self-supervised learning are two different research directions that can improve accuracy by learning from extra unlabeled data. Recent methods from both directions have reported significant gains on traditional benchmarks. Yet past benchmarks do not focus on medical tasks and rarely compare self- and semi- methods together on an equal footing. Furthermore past benchmarks often handle hyperparameter tuning suboptimally. First they may not tune hyperparameters at all leading to underfitting. Second when tuning does occur it often unrealistically uses a labeled validation set that is much larger than the training set. Therefore currently published rankings might not always corroborate with their practical utility This study contributes a systematic evaluation of self- and semi- methods with a unified experimental protocol intended to guide a practitioner with scarce overall labeled data and a limited compute budget. We answer two key questions: Can hyperparameter tuning be effective with realistic-sized validation sets? If so when all methods are tuned well which self- or semi-supervised methods achieve the best accuracy? Our study compares 13 representative semi- and self-supervised methods to strong labeled-set-only baselines on 4 medical datasets. From 20000+ GPU hours of computation we provide valuable best practices to resource-constrained practitioners: hyperparameter tuning is effective and the semi-supervised method known as MixMatch delivers the most reliable gains across 4 datasets",

    "abstract": "3D asset generation is getting massive amounts of attention inspired by the recent success on text-guided 2D content creation. Existing text-to-3D methods use pretrained text-to-image diffusion models in an optimization problem or fine-tune them on synthetic data which often results in non-photorealistic 3D objects without backgrounds. In this paper we present a method that leverages pretrained text-to-image models as a prior and learn to generate multi-view images in a single denoising process from real-world data. Concretely we propose to integrate 3D volume-rendering and cross-frame-attention layers into each block of the existing U-Net network of the text-to-image model. Moreover we design an autoregressive generation that renders more 3D-consistent images at any viewpoint. We train our model on real-world datasets of objects and showcase its capabilities to generate instances with a variety of high-quality shapes and textures in authentic surroundings. Compared to the existing methods the results generated by our method are consistent and have favorable visual quality (-30% FID -37% KID)",

Specifically we bootstrap dense synthetic captions using pre-trained VLMs to provide rich descriptions on different regions in images and incorporate these captions to train a novel detector that generalizes to novel concepts. To mitigate the noise caused by hallucination in synthetic captions we also propose a novel hyperbolic vision-language learning approach to impose a hierarchy between visual and caption embeddings.

We conduct extensive experiments on a wide variety of open-world detection benchmarks (COCO LVIS Object Detection in the Wild RefCOCO) and our results show that our model consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods such as GLIP GLIPv2 and Grounding DINO when using the same backbone",

Addressing this we introduce the Diffusion State Space Model (DiffuSSM) an architecture that supplants attention mechanisms with a more scalable state space model backbone. This approach effectively handles higher resolutions without resorting to global compression thus preserving detailed image representation throughout the diffusion process. Our focus on FLOP-efficient architectures in diffusion training marks a significant step forward.

In legal doctrine however determining the degree of similarity between works requires subjective analysis and fact-finders (judges and juries) can demonstrate considerable variability in these subjective judgement calls. Images that are structurally similar can be deemed dissimilar whereas images of completely different scenes can be deemed similar enough to support a claim of copying. We seek to define and compute a notion of \"conceptual similarity\" among images that captures high-level relations even among images that do not share repeated elements or visually similar components. The idea is to use a base multi-modal model to generate \"explanations\" (captions) of visual data at increasing levels of complexity. Then similarity can be measured by the length of the caption needed to discriminate between the two images: Two highly dissimilar images can be discriminated early in their description whereas conceptually dissimilar ones will need more detail to be distinguished. We operationalize this definition and show that it correlates with subjective (averaged human evaluation) assessment and beats existing baselines on both image-to-image and text-to-text similarity benchmarks.

    "abstract": "Existing methods for synthesizing 3D human gestures from speech have shown promising results but they do not explicitly model the impact of emotions on the generated gestures. Instead these methods directly output animations from speech without control over the expressed emotion. To address this limitation we present AMUSE an emotional speech-driven body animation model based on latent diffusion. Our observation is that content (i.e. gestures related to speech rhythm and word utterances) emotion and personal style are separable. To account for this AMUSE maps the driving audio to three disentangled latent vectors: one for content one for emotion and one for personal style. A latent diffusion model trained to generate gesture motion sequences is then conditioned on these latent vectors. Once trained AMUSE synthesizes 3D human gestures directly from speech with control over the expressed emotions and style by combining the content from the driving speech with the emotion and style of another speech sequence. Randomly sampling the noise of the diffusion model further generates variations of the gesture with the same emotional expressivity. Qualitative quantitative and perceptual evaluations demonstrate that AMUSE outputs realistic gesture sequences. Compared to the state of the art the generated gestures are better synchronized with the speech content and better represent the emotion expressed by the input speech.

However many of these datasets fail to incorporate a full range of driving conditions; some datasets only contain clear-weather conditions underrepresenting or entirely missing colder weather conditions such as snow or autumn scenes with bright colorful foliage. In this paper we present the Michigan State University Four Seasons (MSU-4S) Dataset which contains real-world collections of autonomous vehicle data from varied types of driving scenarios. These scenarios were recorded throughout a full range of seasons and capture clear rainy snowy and fall weather conditions at varying times of day. MSU-4S contains more than 100000 two- and three-dimensional frames for camera lidar and radar data as well as Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) wheel speed and steering data all annotated with weather time-of-day and time-of-year. Our data includes cluttered scenes that have large numbers of vehicles and pedestrians; and it also captures industrial scenes busy traffic thoroughfare with traffic lights and numerous signs and scenes with dense foliage. While providing a diverse set of scenes our data incorporate an important feature: virtually every scene and its corresponding lidar camera and radar frames were captured in four different seasons enabling unparalleled object detection analysis and testing of the domain shift problem across weather conditions. In that context we present detailed analyses for 3D and 2D object detection showing a strong domain shift effect among MSU-4S data segments collected across different conditions. MSU-4S will also enable advanced multimodal fusion research including different combinations of camera-lidar-radar fusion which continues to be of strong interest for the computer vision autonomous driving and ADAS development communities.

    "abstract": "Online Continual Learning (CL) solves the problem of learning the ever-emerging new classification tasks from a continuous data stream. Unlike its offline counterpart in online CL the training data can only be seen once. Most existing online CL research regards catastrophic forgetting (i.e. model stability) as almost the only challenge. In this paper we argue that the model's capability to acquire new knowledge (i.e. model plasticity) is another challenge in online CL. While replay-based strategies have been shown to be effective in alleviating catastrophic forgetting there is a notable gap in research attention toward improving model plasticity. To this end we propose Collaborative Continual Learning (CCL) a collaborative learning based strategy to improve the model's capability in acquiring new concepts. Additionally we introduce Distillation Chain (DC) a collaborative learning scheme to boost the training of the models. We adapt CCL-DC to existing representative online CL works. Extensive experiments demonstrate that even if the learners are well-trained with state-of-the-art online CL methods our strategy can still improve model plasticity dramatically and thereby improve the overall performance by a large margin.

This efficiency is achieved through two primary innovations. Firstly we utilize an image encoder that transforms input images into a global embedding to grasp the general concept. Secondly we integrate new adapter layers into the pre-trained model enhancing its ability to capture intricate identity details while maintaining language coherence. Significantly our model is trained exclusively on text-image pairs without reliance on concept-specific paired images.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "N:M sparsity has received increasing attention due to its remarkable performance and latency trade-off compared with structured and unstructured sparsity. However existing N:M sparsity methods do not differentiate the relative importance of weights among blocks and leave important weights underappreciated. Besides they directly apply N:M sparsity to the whole network which will cause severe information loss. Thus they are still sub-optimal. In this paper we propose an efficient and effective Multi-Axis Query methodology dubbed as MaxQ to rectify these problems. During the training MaxQ employs a dynamic approach to generate soft N:M masks considering the weight importance across multiple axes. This method enhances the weights with more importance and ensures more effective updates. Meanwhile a sparsity strategy that gradually increases the percentage of N:M weight blocks is applied which allows the network to heal from the pruning-induced damage progressively. During the runtime the N:M soft masks can be precomputed as constants and folded into weights without causing any distortion to the sparse pattern and incurring additional computational overhead. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that MaxQ achieves consistent improvements across diverse CNN architectures in various computer vision tasks including image classification object detection and instance segmentation. For ResNet50 with 1:16 sparse pattern MaxQ can achieve 74.6% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet and improve by over 2.8% over the state-of-the-art.

In this paper we argue that relying solely on aligning label-level semantics and global skeleton features is insufficient to effectively transfer locally consistent visual knowledge from seen to unseen classes. To address this limitation we introduce Part-aware Unified Representation between Language and Skeleton (PURLS) to explore visual-semantic alignment at both local and global scales. PURLS introduces a new prompting module and a novel partitioning module to generate aligned textual and visual representations across different levels. The former leverages a pre-trained GPT-3 to infer refined descriptions of the global and local (body-part-based and temporal-interval-based) movements from the original action labels. The latter employs an adaptive sampling strategy to group visual features from all body joint movements that are semantically relevant to a given description. Our approach is evaluated on various skeleton/language backbones and three large-scale datasets i.e. NTU-RGB+D 60 NTU-RGB+D 120 and a newly curated dataset Kinetics-skeleton 200.

Therefore event cameras are widely applied in diverse computer vision applications where event-based keypoint detection is a fundamental task. However achieving robust event-based keypoint detection remains challenging because the ground truth of event keypoints is difficult to obtain descriptors extracted by CNN usually lack discriminative ability in the presence of intense noise and fixed keypoint detectors are limited in detecting varied keypoint patterns. To address these challenges a novel event-based keypoint detection method is proposed by learning dynamic detectors and contextual descriptors in a self-supervised manner (SD2Event) including a contextual feature descriptor learning (CFDL) module and a dynamic keypoint detector learning (DKDL) module. The proposed SD2Event enjoys several merits. First the proposed CFDL module can model long-range contexts efficiently and effectively. Second the DKDL module generates dynamic keypoint detectors which can detect keypoints with diverse patterns across various event streams. Third the proposed self-supervised signals can guide the model's adaptation to event data.

Most existing work utilizes a tailored cross-attention mechanism to perform local alignment across the two image and text modalities. This is computationally expensive even though it is more powerful than the unimodal dual-encoder approach. This work introduces a dual-encoder image-text matching model leveraging a scene graph to represent captions with nodes for objects and attributes interconnected by relational edges. Utilizing a graph attention network our model efficiently encodes object-attribute and object-object semantic relations resulting in a robust and fast-performing system. Representing caption as a scene graph offers the ability to utilize the strong relational inductive bias of graph neural networks to learn object-attribute and object-object relations effectively. To train the model we propose losses that align the image and caption both at the holistic level (image-caption) and the local level (image-object entity) which we show is key to the success of the model. Our model is termed Composition model for Object Relations and Attributes CORA. Experimental results on two prominent image-text retrieval benchmarks Flickr30K and MS-COCO demonstrate that CORA outperforms existing state-of-the-art computationally expensive cross-attention methods regarding recall score while achieving fast computation speed of the dual encoder.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "In radio astronomy visibility data which are measurements of wave signals from radio telescopes are transformed into images for observation of distant celestial objects. However these resultant images usually contain both real sources and artifacts due to signal sparsity and other factors. One way to obtain cleaner images is to reconstruct samples into dense forms before imaging. Unfortunately existing reconstruction methods often miss some components of visibility in frequency domain so blurred object edges and persistent artifacts remain in the images. Furthermore the computation overhead is high on irregular visibility samples due to the data skew. To address these problems we propose PolarRec a transformer-encoder-conditioned reconstruction pipeline with visibility samples converted into the polar coordinate system. This coordinate system matches the way in which radio telescopes observe a celestial area as the Earth rotates. As a result visibility samples distribute in the polar system more uniformly than in the Cartesian space. Therefore we propose to use radial distance in the loss function to help reconstruct complete visibility effectively. Also we group visibility samples by their polar angles and propose a group-based encoding scheme to improve the efficiency. Our experiments demonstrate that PolarRec markedly improves imaging results by faithfully reconstructing all frequency components in the visibility domain while significantly reducing the computation cost in visibility data encoding.

To address the division-by-zero issue arising from fractional differential invariants of the affine group we construct a new kind of affine invariants by normalizing polynomial relative differential invariants to replace classical differential invariants. For further flexibility we design an equivariant layer which can be directly integrated into convolutional networks of various architectures. Moreover our framework for the affine group is also applicable to its continuous subgroups. We implement equivariant networks for the scale group the rotation-scale group and the affine group. Numerical experiments demonstrate the outstanding performance of our framework across classification tasks involving transformations of these groups.

While prevailing deep learning-based supervised and self-supervised methods have excelled in eliminating in-distribution noise their susceptibility to out-of-distribution (OOD) noise remains a significant challenge. The recent emergence of contrastive language-image pre-training (CLIP) model has showcased exceptional capabilities in open-world image recognition and segmentation. Yet the potential for leveraging CLIP to enhance the robustness of low-level tasks remains largely unexplored. This paper uncovers that certain dense features extracted from the frozen ResNet image encoder of CLIP exhibit distortion-invariant and content-related properties which are highly desirable for generalizable denoising. Leveraging these properties we devise an asymmetrical encoder-decoder denoising network which incorporates dense features including the noisy image and its multi-scale features from the frozen ResNet encoder of CLIP into a learnable image decoder to achieve generalizable denoising. The progressive feature augmentation strategy is further proposed to mitigate feature overfitting and improve the robustness of the learnable decoder.

Despite this advancement latent space smoothness within diffusion models remains largely unexplored. Smooth latent spaces ensure that a perturbation on an input latent corresponds to a steady change in the output image. This property proves beneficial in downstream tasks including image interpolation inversion and editing. In this work we expose the non-smoothness of diffusion latent spaces by observing noticeable visual fluctuations resulting from minor latent variations. To tackle this issue we propose Smooth Diffusion a new category of diffusion models that can be simultaneously high-performing and smooth. Specifically we introduce Step-wise Variation Regularization to enforce the proportion between the variations of an arbitrary input latent and that of the output image is a constant at any diffusion training step. In addition we devise an interpolation standard deviation (ISTD) metric to effectively assess the latent space smoothness of a diffusion model. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate that Smooth Diffusion stands out as a more desirable solution not only in T2I generation but also across various downstream tasks.

    "abstract": "3D visual grounding plays a crucial role in scene understanding with extensive applications in AR/VR. Despite the significant progress made in recent methods the requirement of dense textual descriptions for each individual object which is time-consuming and costly hinders their scalability. To mitigate reliance on text annotations during training researchers have explored language-free training paradigms in the 2D field via explicit text generation or implicit feature substitution. Nevertheless unlike 2D images the complexity of spatial relations in 3D coupled with the absence of robust 3D visual language pre-trained models makes it challenging to directly transfer previous strategies. To tackle the above issues in this paper we introduce a language-free training framework for 3D visual grounding. By utilizing the visual-language joint embedding in 2D large cross-modality model as a bridge we can expediently produce the pseudo-language features by leveraging the features of 2D images which are equivalent to that of real textual descriptions. We further develop a relation injection scheme with a Neighboring Relation-aware Modeling module and a Cross-modality Relation Consistency module aiming to enhance and preserve the complex relationships between the 2D and 3D embedding space.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Vision foundation models have been explored recently to build general-purpose vision systems. However predominant paradigms driven by casting instance-level tasks as an object-word alignment bring heavy cross-modality interaction which is not effective in prompting object detection and visual grounding. Another line of work that focuses on pixel-level tasks often encounters a large annotation gap of things and stuff and suffers from mutual interference between foreground-object and background-class segmentation. In stark contrast to the prevailing methods we present APE a universal visual perception model for aligning and prompting everything all at once in an image to perform diverse tasks i.e. detection segmentation and grounding as an instance-level sentence-object matching paradigm. Specifically APE advances the convergence of detection and grounding by reformulating language-guided grounding as open-vocabulary detection which efficiently scales up model prompting to thousands of category vocabularies and region descriptions while maintaining the effectiveness of cross-modality fusion. To bridge the granularity gap of different pixel-level tasks APE equalizes semantic and panoptic segmentation to proxy instance learning by considering any isolated regions as individual instances. APE aligns vision and language representation on broad data with natural and challenging characteristics all at once without task-specific fine-tuning. The extensive experiments on over 160 datasets demonstrate that with only one-suit of weights APE outperforms (or is on par with) the state-of-the-art models proving that an effective yet universal perception for anything aligning and prompting is indeed feasible.

    "abstract": "Multimodal sentiment analysis (MSA) aims to understand human sentiment through multimodal data. Most MSA efforts are based on the assumption of modality completeness. However in real-world applications some practical factors cause uncertain modality missingness which drastically degrades the model's performance. To this end we propose a Correlation-decoupled Knowledge Distillation (CorrKD) framework for the MSA task under uncertain missing modalities. Specifically we present a sample-level contrastive distillation mechanism that transfers comprehensive knowledge containing cross-sample correlations to reconstruct missing semantics. Moreover a category-guided prototype distillation mechanism is introduced to capture cross-category correlations using category prototypes to align feature distributions and generate favorable joint representations. Eventually we design a response-disentangled consistency distillation strategy to optimize the sentiment decision boundaries of the student network through response disentanglement and mutual information maximization.

    "abstract": "The machine learning community has witnessed a drastic change in the training pipeline pivoted by those \"foundation models\" with unprecedented scales. However the field of adversarial training is lagging behind predominantly centered around small model sizes like ResNet-50 and tiny and low-resolution datasets like CIFAR-10. To bridge this transformation gap this paper provides a modern re-examination with adversarial training investigating its potential benefits when applied at scale. Additionally we introduce an efficient and effective training strategy to enable adversarial training with giant models and web-scale data at an affordable computing cost. We denote this newly introduced framework as AdvXL. Empirical results demonstrate that AdvXL establishes new state-of-the-art robust accuracy records under AutoAttack on ImageNet-1K. For example by training on DataComp-1B dataset our AdvXL empowers a vanilla ViT-g model to substantially surpass the previous records of l_ infinity - l_ 2 - and l_ 1 -robust accuracy by margins of 11.4% 14.2% and 12.9% respectively. This achievement posits AdvXL as a pioneering approach charting a new trajectory for the efficient training of robust visual representations at significantly larger scales.

    "abstract": "Although adversarial training (AT) has proven effective in enhancing the model's robustness the recently revealed issue of fairness in robustness has not been well addressed i.e. the robust accuracy varies significantly among different categories. In this paper instead of uniformly evaluating the model's average class performance we delve into the issue of robust fairness by considering the worst-case distribution across various classes. We propose a novel learning paradigm named Fairness-Aware Adversarial Learning (FAAL). As a generalization of conventional AT we re-define the problem of adversarial training as a min-max-max framework to ensure both robustness and fairness of the trained model. Specifically by taking advantage of distributional robust optimization our method aims to find the worst distribution among different categories and the solution is guaranteed to obtain the upper bound performance with high probability. In particular FAAL can fine-tune an unfair robust model to be fair within only two epochs without compromising the overall clean and robust accuracies. Extensive experiments on various image datasets validate the superior performance and efficiency of the proposed FAAL compared to other state-of-the-art methods",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Referring video object segmentation (RVOS) aims to segment the target instance referred by a given text expression in a video clip. The text expression normally contains sophisticated description of the instance's appearance action and relation with others. It is therefore rather difficult for a RVOS model to capture all these attributes correspondingly in the video; in fact the model often favours more on the action- and relation-related visual attributes of the instance. This can end up with partial or even incorrect mask prediction of the target instance. We tackle this problem by taking a subject-centric short text expression from the original long text expression. The short one retains only the appearance-related information of the target instance so that we can use it to focus the model's attention on the instance's appearance. We let the model make joint predictions using both long and short text expressions; and insert a long-short cross-attention module to interact the joint features and a long-short predictions intersection loss to regulate the joint predictions. Besides the improvement on the linguistic part we also introduce a forward-backward visual consistency loss which utilizes optical flows to warp visual features between the annotated frames and their temporal neighbors for consistency. We build our method on top of two state of the art pipelines. Extensive experiments on A2D-Sentences Refer-YouTube-VOS JHMDB-Sentences and Refer-DAVIS17 show impressive improvements of our method.

    "abstract": "Nowadays leveraging 2D images and pre-trained models to guide 3D point cloud feature representation has shown a remarkable potential to boost the performance of 3D fundamental models. While some works rely on additional data such as 2D real-world images and their corresponding camera poses recent studies target at using point cloud exclusively by designing 3D-to-2D projection. However in the indoor scene scenario existing 3D-to-2D projection strategies suffer from severe occlusions and incoherence which fail to contain sufficient information for fine-grained point cloud segmentation task. In this paper we argue that the crux of the matter resides in the basic premise of existing projection strategies that the medium is homogeneous thereby projection rays propagate along straight lines and behind objects are occluded by front ones. Inspired by the phenomenon of mirage where the occluded objects are exposed by distorted light rays due to heterogeneous medium refraction rate we propose MirageRoom by designing parametric mirage projection with heterogeneous medium to obtain series of projected images with various distorted degrees. We further develop a masked reprojection module across 2D and 3D latent space to bridge the gap between pre-trained 2D backbone and 3D point-wise features.

In this paper we introduce a novel DCCHI reconstruction network intra-inter similarity exploiting Transformer (In2SET). Our key insight is to make full use of the PAN image to assist the reconstruction. To this end we propose to use the intra-similarity within the PAN image as a proxy for approximating the intra-similarity in the original HSI thereby offering an enhanced content prior for more accurate HSI reconstruction. Furthermore we propose to use the inter-similarity to align the features between HSI and PAN images thereby maintaining semantic consistency between the two modalities during the reconstruction process. By integrating In2SET into a PAN-guided deep unrolling (PGDU) framework our method substantially enhances the spatial-spectral fidelity and detail of the reconstructed images providing a more comprehensive and accurate depiction of the scene.

    "abstract": "Look-Up Table (LUT) has recently gained increasing attention for restoring High-Quality (HQ) images from Low-Quality (LQ) observations thanks to its high computational efficiency achieved through a \"space for time\" strategy of caching learned LQ-HQ pairs. However incorporating multiple LUTs for improved performance comes at the cost of a rapidly growing storage size which is ultimately restricted by the allocatable on-device cache size. In this work we propose a novel LUT compression framework to achieve a better trade-off between storage size and performance for LUT-based image restoration models. Based on the observation that most cached LQ image patches are distributed along the diagonal of a LUT we devise a Diagonal-First Compression (DFC) framework where diagonal LQ-HQ pairs are preserved and carefully re-indexed to maintain the representation capacity while non-diagonal pairs are aggressively subsampled to save storage. Extensive experiments on representative image restoration tasks demonstrate that our DFC framework significantly reduces the storage size of LUT-based models (including our new design) while maintaining their performance. For instance DFC saves up to 90% of storage at a negligible performance drop for x4 super-resolution. The source code is available on GitHub: https://github.com/leenas233/DFC",

They operate through a two-steps process: introducing noise into training samples and then employing a model to convert random noise into new samples (e.g. images). However their remarkable generative performance is hindered by slow training and sampling. This is due to the necessity of tracking extensive forward and reverse diffusion trajectories and employing a large model with numerous parameters across multiple timesteps (i.e. noise levels). To tackle these challenges we present a multi-stage framework inspired by our empirical findings. These observations indicate the advantages of employing distinct parameters tailored to each timestep while retaining universal parameters shared across all time steps. Our approach involves segmenting the time interval into multiple stages where we employ custom multi-decoder U-net architecture that blends time-dependent models with a universally shared encoder. Our framework enables the efficient distribution of computational resources and mitigates inter-stage interference which substantially improves training efficiency. Extensive numerical experiments affirm the effectiveness of our framework showcasing significant training and sampling efficiency enhancements on three state-of-the-art diffusion models including large-scale latent diffusion models.

We observe that models will easily fall into the pitfall of shortcut learning and form a biased non-collapsed feature space at the early period of training which is hard to reverse and limits the generalization capability. To tackle the root cause of biased classification we follow the recent inspiration of prime training and propose an avoid-shortcut learning framework without additional training complexity. With well-designed shortcut primes based on Neural Collapse structure the models are encouraged to skip the pursuit of simple shortcuts and naturally capture the intrinsic correlations.

STE is a fusion of the Tyler's M-estimator (TME) and a variant of the fast median subspace. Our theoretical analysis suggests that under a common inlier-outlier model STE can effectively recover the underlying subspace even when it contains a smaller fraction of inliers relative to other methods in the field of robust subspace recovery. We apply STE in the context of Structure from Motion (SfM) in two ways: for robust estimation of the fundamental matrix and for the removal of outlying cameras enhancing the robustness of the SfM pipeline. Numerical experiments confirm the state-of-the-art performance of our method in these applications. This research makes significant contributions to the field of robust subspace recovery particularly in the context of computer vision and 3D reconstruction",

    "abstract": "While previous studies have demonstrated successful 3D object shape completion with a sufficient number of points they often fail in scenarios when a few points e.g. tens of points are observed. Surprisingly via entropy analysis we find that even a few points e.g. 64 points could retain substantial information to help recover the 3D shape of the object. To address the challenge of shape completion with very sparse point clouds we then propose Few-point Shape Completion (FSC) model which contains a novel dual-branch feature extractor for handling extremely sparse inputs coupled with an extensive branch for maximal point utilization with a saliency branch for dynamic importance assignment. This model is further bolstered by a two-stage revision network that refines both the extracted features and the decoder output enhancing the detail and authenticity of the completed point cloud. Our experiments demonstrate the feasibility of recovering 3D shapes from a few points. The proposed Few-point Shape Completion (FSC) model outperforms previous methods on both few-point inputs and many-point inputs and shows good generalizability to different object categories",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "The increased demand for 3D data in AR/VR robotics and gaming applications gave rise to powerful generative pipelines capable of synthesizing high-quality 3D objects. Most of these models rely on the Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) algorithm to optimize a 3D representation such that the rendered image maintains a high likelihood as evaluated by a pre-trained diffusion model. However this distillation process involves finding a correct mode in the high-dimensional and large-variance distribution produced by the diffusion model. This task is challenging and often leads to issues such as over-saturation over-smoothing and Janus-like artifacts in the 3D generation. In this paper we propose a novel learning paradigm for 3D synthesis that utilizes pre-trained diffusion models. Instead of focusing on mode-seeking our method directly models the distribution discrepancy between multi-view renderings and diffusion priors in an adversarial manner which unlocks the generation of high-fidelity and photorealistic 3D content conditioned on a single image and prompt. Moreover by harnessing the latent space of GANs and expressive diffusion model priors our method enables a wide variety of 3D applications including single-view reconstruction high diversity generation and continuous 3D interpolation in open domain. Our experiments demonstrate the superiority of our pipeline compared to previous works in terms of generation quality and diversity",

    "title": "T-VSL: Text-Guided Visual Sound Source Localization in Mixtures",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Visual sound source localization poses a significant challenge in identifying the semantic region of each sounding source within a video. Existing self-supervised and weakly supervised source localization methods struggle to accurately distinguish the semantic regions of each sounding object particularly in multi-source mixtures. These methods often rely on audio-visual correspondence as guidance which can lead to substantial performance drops in complex multi-source localization scenarios. The lack of access to individual source sounds in multi-source mixtures during training exacerbates the difficulty of learning effective audio-visual correspondence for localization. To address this limitation in this paper we propose incorporating the text modality as an intermediate feature guide using tri-modal joint embedding models (e.g. AudioCLIP) to disentangle the semantic audio-visual source correspondence in multi-source mixtures. Our framework dubbed T-VSL begins by predicting the class of sounding entities in mixtures. Subsequently the textual representation of each sounding source is employed as guidance to disentangle fine-grained audio-visual source correspondence from multi-source mixtures leveraging the tri-modal AudioCLIP embedding. This approach enables our framework to handle a flexible number of sources and exhibits promising zero-shot transferability to unseen classes during test time. Extensive experiments conducted on the MUSIC VGGSound and VGGSound-Instruments datasets demonstrate significant performance improvements over state-of-the-art methods.

To accomplish this goal we argue that our generative model should be capable of the following favorable characteristics: (1) a strong visual and semantic understanding of our world and human society for basic object and human image generation. (2) generalizable identity preservation ability. (3) flexible and fine-grained head control. Recently large pre-trained text-to-image diffusion models have shown remarkable results serving as a powerful generative foundation. As a basis we aim to unleash the above two capabilities of the pre-trained model. In this work we present a new framework named CapHuman. We embrace the \"encode then learn to align\" paradigm which enables generalizable identity preservation for new individuals without cumbersome tuning at inference. CapHuman encodes identity features and then learns to align them into the latent space. Moreover we introduce the 3D facial prior to equip our model with control over the human head in a flexible and 3D-consistent manner. Extensive qualitative and quantitative analyses demonstrate our CapHuman can produce well-identity-preserved photo-realistic and high-fidelity portraits with content-rich representations and various head renditions superior to established baselines.

Nonetheless most of these top-performing transformer-based models are too computation-consuming and storage-demanding to deploy on edge computing platforms. Those transformer-based models that require fewer resources are prone to under-fitting due to their smaller scale and thus perform notably worse than their larger counterparts. Given this conundrum we introduce SDPose a new self-distillation method for improving the performance of small transformer-based models. To mitigate the problem of under-fitting we design a transformer module named Multi-Cycled Transformer(MCT) based on multiple-cycled forwards to more fully exploit the potential of small model parameters. Further in order to prevent the additional inference compute-consuming brought by MCT we introduce a self-distillation scheme extracting the knowledge from the MCT module to a naive forward model. Specifically on the MSCOCO validation dataset SDPose-T obtains 69.7% mAP with 4.4M parameters and 1.8 GFLOPs. Furthermore SDPose-S-V2 obtains 73.5% mAP on the MSCOCO validation dataset with 6.2M parameters and 4.7 GFLOPs achieving a new state-of-the-art among predominant tiny neural network methods",

Ideally 3D backbones for lidar should be able to inherit these properties after distillation of these powerful 2D features. The most recent methods for image-to-lidar distillation on autonomous driving data show promising results obtained thanks to distillation methods that keep improving. Yet we still notice a large performance gap when measuring by linear probing the quality of distilled vs fully supervised features. In this work instead of focusing only on the distillation method we study the effect of three pillars for distillation: the 3D backbone the pretrained 2D backbone and the pretraining 2D+3D dataset. In particular thanks to our scalable distillation method named ScaLR we show that scaling the 2D and 3D backbones and pretraining on diverse datasets leads to a substantial improvement of the feature quality. This allows us to significantly reduce the gap between the quality of distilled and fully-supervised 3D features and to improve the robustness of the pretrained backbones to domain gaps and perturbations",

The core idea of the proposed model is to generate all attributes (e.g. human body hair clothes and so on) in an overall attribute space with six feature planes which are then decomposed and manipulated with different attribute indexes. To precisely extract features of different attributes from the generated feature planes we propose a novel attribute indexing method as well as an orthogonal projection regularization to enhance the disentanglement. We also introduce a hyper-latent training strategy and an attribute-specific sampling strategy to avoid style entanglement and misleading punishment from the discriminator. Our method allows users to interactively edit selected attributes in the generated 3D human avatars while keeping others fixed.

However they struggle to handle complex scenarios with curvilinear motions since they overlook the latent acceleration information between the input frames. Moreover the supervision of predicted motions is tricky because ground-truth motions are not available. To this end we propose a novel framework for implicit quadratic video frame interpolation (IQ-VFI) which explores latent acceleration information and accurate intermediate motions via knowledge distillation. Specifically the proposed IQ-VFI consists of an implicit acceleration estimation network (IANet) and a VFI backbone the former fully leverages spatio-temporal information to explore latent acceleration priors between two input frames which is then used to progressively modulate linear motions from the latter into quadratic motions in coarse-to-fine manner. Furthermore to encourage both components to distill more acceleration and motion cues oriented towards VFI we propose a knowledge distillation strategy in which implicit acceleration distillation loss and implicit motion distillation loss are employed to adaptively guide latent acceleration priors and intermediate motions learning respectively.

Such robustness becomes useful in various recognition tasks such as face recognition when image alignment failures occur. We propose a novel method called KP-RPE which leverages key points (e.g.facial landmarks) to make ViT more resilient to scale translation and pose variations. We begin with the observation that Relative Position Encoding (RPE) is a good way to bring affine transform generalization to ViTs. RPE however can only inject the model with prior knowledge that nearby pixels are more important than far pixels. Keypoint RPE (KP-RPE) is an extension of this principle where the significance of pixels is not solely dictated by their proximity but also by their relative positions to specific keypoints within the image. By anchoring the significance of pixels around keypoints the model can more effectively retain spatial relationships even when those relationships are disrupted by affine transformations. We show the merit of KP-RPE in face and gait recognition. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness in improving face recognition performance from low-quality images particularly where alignment is prone to failure.

The challenge of MD lies in the diverse nature of mesh facets in terms of geometric characteristics and noise distributions. Despite recent advancements in deep learning-based MD methods existing MD networks typically neglect the consideration of geometric characteristics and noise distributions. In this paper we propose Hyper-MD a hyper-network-based approach that addresses this limitation by dynamically customizing denoising parameters for each facet based on its noise intensity and geometric characteristics. Specifically Hyper-MD is composed of a hyper-network and an MD network. For each noisy facet the hyper-network takes two angles as input to customize parameters for the MD network. These two angles are specially defined to reveal the noise intensity and geometric characteristics of the current facet respectively. The MD network receives a facet patch as input and outputs the denoised normal using the customized parameters. Experimental results on synthetic and real-scanned meshes demonstrate that Hyper-MD outperforms state-of-the-art mesh denoising methods",

    "abstract": "Vector-Quantized (VQ-based) generative models usually consist of two basic components i.e. VQ tokenizers and generative transformers. Prior research focuses on improving the reconstruction fidelity of VQ tokenizers but rarely examines how the improvement in reconstruction affects the generation ability of generative transformers. In this paper we find that improving the reconstruction fidelity of VQ tokenizers does not necessarily improve the generation. Instead learning to compress semantic features within VQ tokenizers significantly improves generative transformers' ability to capture textures and structures. We thus highlight two competing objectives of VQ tokenizers for image synthesis: semantic compression and details preservation. Different from previous work that prioritizes better details preservation we propose Semantic-Quantized GAN (SeQ-GAN) with two learning phases to balance the two objectives. In the first phase we propose a semantic-enhanced perceptual loss for better semantic compression. In the second phase we fix the encoder and codebook but finetune the decoder to achieve better details preservation. Our proposed SeQ-GAN significantly improves VQ-based generative models for both unconditional and conditional image generation. Specifically SeQ-GAN achieves a Frechet Inception Distance (FID) of 6.25 and Inception Score (IS) of 140.9 on 256x256 ImageNet generation a remarkable improvement over VIT-VQGAN which obtains 11.2 FID and 97.2 IS",

To address this issue we propose MESA a novel approach to establish precise area (or region) matches for efficient matching redundancy reduction. MESA first leverages the advanced image understanding capability of SAM a state-of-the-art foundation model for image segmentation to obtain image areas with implicit semantic. Then a multi-relational graph is proposed to model the spatial structure of these areas and construct their scale hierarchy. Based on graphical models derived from the graph the area matching is reformulated as an energy minimization task and effectively resolved.

    "abstract": "We present a method to reconstruct indoor and outdoor static scene geometry and appearance from an omnidirectional video moving in a small circular sweep. This setting is challenging because of the small baseline and large depth ranges making it difficult to find ray crossings. To better constrain the optimization we estimate geometry as a signed distance field within a spherical binoctree data structure and use a complementary efficient tree traversal strategy based on a breadth-first search for sampling. Unlike regular grids or trees the shape of this structure well-matches the camera setting creating a better memory-quality trade-off. From an initial depth estimate the binoctree is adaptively subdivided throughout the optimization; previous methods use a fixed depth that leaves the scene undersampled. In comparison with three neural optimization methods and two non-neural methods ours shows decreased geometry error on average especially in a detailed scene while significantly reducing the required number of voxels to represent such details",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Recovering ghost-free High Dynamic Range (HDR) images from multiple Low Dynamic Range (LDR) images becomes challenging when the LDR images exhibit saturation and significant motion. Recent Diffusion Models (DMs) have been introduced in HDR imaging field demonstrating promising performance particularly in achieving visually perceptible results compared to previous DNN-based methods. However DMs require extensive iterations with large models to estimate entire images resulting in inefficiency that hinders their practical application. To address this challenge we propose the Low-Frequency aware Diffusion (LF-Diff) model for ghost-free HDR imaging. The key idea of LF-Diff is implementing the DMs in a highly compacted latent space and integrating it into a regression-based model to enhance the details of reconstructed images. Specifically as low-frequency information is closely related to human visual perception we propose to utilize DMs to create compact low-frequency priors for the reconstruction process. In addition to take full advantage of the above low-frequency priors the Dynamic HDR Reconstruction Network (DHRNet) is carried out in a regression-based manner to obtain final HDR images. Extensive experiments conducted on synthetic and real-world benchmark datasets demonstrate that our LF-Diff performs favorably against several state-of-the-art methods and is 10x faster than previous DM-based methods",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "A fundamental characteristic common to both human vision and natural language is their compositional nature. Yet despite the performance gains contributed by large vision and language pretraining recent investigations find that most--if not all--our state-of-the-art vision-language models struggle at compositionality. They are unable to distinguish between images of \"a girl in white facing a man in black\" and \"a girl in black facing a man in white\". Moreover prior work suggests that compositionality doesn't arise with scale: larger model sizes or training data don't help. This paper develops a new iterated training algorithm that incentivizes compositionality. We draw on decades of cognitive science research that identifies cultural transmission--the need to teach a new generation--as a necessary inductive prior that incentivizes humans to develop compositional languages. Specifically we reframe vision-language contrastive learning as the Lewis Signaling Game between a vision agent and a language agent and operationalize cultural transmission by iteratively resetting one of the agent's weights during training. After every iteration this training paradigm induces representations that become \"easier to learn\" a property of compositional languages: e.g. our model trained on CC3M and CC12M improves standard CLIP by 4.7% 4.0% respectfully in the SugarCrepe benchmark",

    "abstract": "Tracking with bio-inspired event cameras has garnered increasing interest in recent years. Existing works either utilize aligned RGB and event data for accurate tracking or directly learn an event-based tracker. The former incurs higher inference costs while the latter may be susceptible to the impact of noisy events or sparse spatial resolution. In this paper we propose a novel hierarchical knowledge distillation framework that can fully utilize multi-modal / multi-view information during training to facilitate knowledge transfer enabling us to achieve high-speed and low-latency visual tracking during testing by using only event signals. Specifically a teacher Transformer-based multi-modal tracking framework is first trained by feeding the RGB frame and event stream simultaneously. Then we design a new hierarchical knowledge distillation strategy which includes pairwise similarity feature representation and response maps-based knowledge distillation to guide the learning of the student Transformer network. In particular since existing event-based tracking datasets are all low-resolution (346 * 260) we propose the first large-scale high-resolution (1280 * 720) dataset named EventVOT. It contains 1141 videos and covers a wide range of categories such as pedestrians vehicles UAVs ping pong etc. Extensive experiments on both low-resolution (FE240hz VisEvent COESOT) and our newly proposed high-resolution EventVOT dataset fully validated the effectiveness of our proposed method.

    "abstract": "Temporal Action Detection (TAD) aims to identify the action boundaries and the corresponding category within untrimmed videos. Inspired by the success of DETR in object detection several methods have adapted the query-based framework to the TAD task. However these approaches primarily followed DETR to predict actions at the instance level (i.e. identify each action by its center point) leading to sub-optimal boundary localization. To address this issue we propose a new Dual-level query-based TAD framework namely DualDETR to detect actions from both instance-level and boundary-level. Decoding at different levels requires semantics of different granularity therefore we introduce a two-branch decoding structure. This structure builds distinctive decoding processes for different levels facilitating explicit capture of temporal cues and semantics at each level. On top of the two-branch design we present a joint query initialization strategy to align queries from both levels. Specifically we leverage encoder proposals to match queries from each level in a one-to-one manner. Then the matched queries are initialized using position and content prior from the matched action proposal. The aligned dual-level queries can refine the matched proposal with complementary cues during subsequent decoding. We evaluate DualDETR on three challenging multi-label TAD benchmarks. The experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of DualDETR to the existing state-of-the-art methods achieving a substantial improvement under det-mAP and delivering impressive results under seg-mAP",

    "abstract": "Recent Text-to-Image (T2I) generation models such as Stable Diffusion and Imagen have made significant progress in generating high-resolution images based on text descriptions. However many generated images still suffer from issues such as artifacts/implausibility misalignment with text descriptions and low aesthetic quality. Inspired by the success of Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF) for large language models prior works collected human-provided scores as feedback on generated images and trained a reward model to improve the T2I generation. In this paper we enrich the feedback signal by (i) marking image regions that are implausible or misaligned with the text and (ii) annotating which words in the text prompt are misrepresented or missing on the image. We collect such rich human feedback on 18K generated images (RichHF-18K) and train a multimodal transformer to predict the rich feedback automatically. We show that the predicted rich human feedback can be leveraged to improve image generation for example by selecting high-quality training data to finetune and improve the generative models or by creating masks with predicted heatmaps to inpaint the problematic regions. Notably the improvements generalize to models (Muse) beyond those used to generate the images on which human feedback data were collected (Stable Diffusion variants).

    "abstract": "Pose regression networks predict the camera pose of a query image relative to a known environment. Within this family of methods absolute pose regression (APR) has recently shown promising accuracy in the range of a few centimeters in position error. APR networks encode the scene geometry implicitly in their weights. To achieve high accuracy they require vast amounts of training data that realistically can only be created using novel view synthesis in a days-long process. This process has to be repeated for each new scene again and again. We present a new approach to pose regression map-relative pose regression (marepo) that satisfies the data hunger of the pose regression network in a scene-agnostic fashion. We condition the pose regressor on a scene-specific map representation such that its pose predictions are relative to the scene map. This allows us to train the pose regressor across hundreds of scenes to learn the generic relation between a scene-specific map representation and the camera pose. Our map-relative pose regressor can be applied to new map representations immediately or after mere minutes of fine-tuning for the highest accuracy. Our approach outperforms previous pose regression methods by far on two public datasets indoor and outdoor. Code is available: https://nianticlabs.github.io/marepo",

To address these challenges we propose EN-SLAM the first event-RGBD implicit neural SLAM framework which effectively leverages the high rate and high dynamic range advantages of event data for tracking and mapping. Specifically EN-SLAM proposes a differentiable CRF (Camera Response Function) rendering technique to generate distinct RGB and event camera data via a shared radiance field which is optimized by learning a unified implicit representation with the captured event and RGBD supervision. Moreover based on the temporal difference property of events we propose a temporal aggregating optimization strategy for the event joint tracking and global bundle adjustment capitalizing on the consecutive difference constraints of events significantly enhancing tracking accuracy and robustness. Finally we construct the simulated dataset DEV-Indoors and real captured dataset DEV-Reals containing 6 scenes 17 sequences with practical motion blur and lighting changes for evaluations.

Extensive experiments were conducted on three types of IHC images including a high-resolution hepatocellular carcinoma immunohistochemical dataset proposed by us. The results demonstrated that our proposed confusion-GAN can generate highly realistic images that are capable of deceiving even experienced pathologists.

Leveraging the initial depths and features from this network we uplift the 2D features to form a 3D point cloud and construct a 3D point transformer to process it allowing the model to explicitly learn and exploit 3D geometric features. In addition we propose normalization techniques to process the point cloud which improves learning and leads to better accuracy than directly using point transformers off the shelf. Furthermore we incorporate global attention on downsampled point cloud features which enables long-range context while still being computationally feasible. We evaluate our method DeCoTR on established depth completion benchmarks including NYU Depth V2 and KITTI showcasing that it sets new state-of-the-art performance.

    "abstract": "When building classification systems with demographic fairness considerations there are two objectives to satisfy: 1) maximizing utility for the specific task and 2) ensuring fairness w.r.t. a known demographic attribute. These objectives often compete so optimizing both can lead to a trade-off between utility and fairness. While existing works acknowledge the trade-offs and study their limits two questions remain unanswered: 1) What are the optimal tradeoffs between utility and fairness? and 2) How can we numerically quantify these trade-offs from data for a desired prediction task and demographic attribute of interest? This paper addresses these questions. We introduce two utility-fairness trade-offs: the Data-Space and Label-Space Trade-off. The trade-offs reveal three regions within the utility-fairness plane delineating what is fully and partially possible and impossible. We propose U-FaTE a method to numerically quantify the trade-offs for a given prediction task and group fairness definition from data samples. Based on the trade-offs we introduce a new scheme for evaluating representations. An extensive evaluation of fair representation learning methods and representations from over 1000 pre-trained models revealed that most current approaches are far from the estimated and achievable fairness-utility trade-offs across multiple datasets and prediction tasks",

Existing approaches typically rely on self-training with pseudo-labels since ground-truth cannot be obtained from test data. Although the quality of pseudo labels is important for stable and accurate long-term adaptation it has not been previously addressed. In this work we propose DPLOT a simple yet effective TTA framework that consists of two components: (1) domain-specific block selection and (2) pseudo-label generation using paired-view images. Specifically we select blocks that involve domain-specific feature extraction and train these blocks by entropy minimization. After blocks are adjusted for current test domain we generate pseudo-labels by averaging given test images and corresponding flipped counterparts. By simply using flip augmentation we prevent a decrease in the quality of the pseudo-labels which can be caused by the domain gap resulting from strong augmentation. Our experimental results demonstrate that DPLOT outperforms previous TTA methods in CIFAR10-C CIFAR100-C and ImageNet-C benchmarks reducing error by up to 5.4% 9.1% and 2.9% respectively.

    "abstract": "We present a neural radiance field method for urban-scale semantic and building-level instance segmentation from aerial images by lifting noisy 2D labels to 3D. This is a challenging problem due to two primary reasons. Firstly objects in urban aerial images exhibit substantial variations in size including buildings cars and roads which pose a significant challenge for accurate 2D segmentation. Secondly the 2D labels generated by existing segmentation methods suffer from the multi-view inconsistency problem especially in the case of aerial images where each image captures only a small portion of the entire scene. To overcome these limitations we first introduce a scale-adaptive semantic label fusion strategy that enhances the segmentation of objects of varying sizes by combining labels predicted from different altitudes harnessing the novel-view synthesis capabilities of NeRF. We then introduce a novel cross-view instance label grouping strategy based on the 3D scene representation to mitigate the multi-view inconsistency problem in the 2D instance labels. Furthermore we exploit multi-view reconstructed depth priors to improve the geometric quality of the reconstructed radiance field resulting in enhanced segmentation results. Experiments on multiple real-world urban-scale datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing methods highlighting its effectiveness.

Unlike prior approaches that rely on pre-defined category-specific 3D templates or tailored 3D skeletons SAOR learns to articulate shapes from single-view image collections with a skeleton-free part-based model without requiring any 3D object shape priors. To prevent ill-posed solutions we propose a cross-instance consistency loss that exploits disentangled object shape deformation and articulation. This is helped by a new silhouette-based sampling mechanism to enhance viewpoint diversity during training. Our method only requires estimated object silhouettes and relative depth maps from off-the-shelf pre-trained networks during training. At inference time given a single-view image it efficiently outputs an explicit mesh representation.

Moreover to address the problem of open-set long-tail distribution of textual descriptions a test-time similarity calibration method is proposed to refine the confidence score with pseudo frequency. Extensive experiments on Refer-KITTI dataset verify the effectiveness of our framework.

In this paper we analyze the bottlenecks exist in contrastive learning-based methods and offer a fresh perspective on inter-pixel correlations to construct more safe and effective supervision signals which is in line with the nature of semantic segmentation. To this end we develop a coherent RankMatch network including the construction of representative agents to model inter-pixel correlation beyond regular individual pixel-wise consistency and further unlock the potential of agents by modeling inter-agent relationships in pursuit of rank-aware correlation consistency.

RoHM is a novel diffusion-based motion model that conditioned on noisy and occluded input data reconstructs complete plausible motions in consistent global coordinates. Given the complexity of the problem -- requiring one to address different tasks (denoising and infilling) in different solution spaces (local and global motion) -- we decompose it into two sub-tasks and learn two models one for global trajectory and one for local motion. To capture the correlations between the two we then introduce a novel conditioning module combining it with an iterative inference scheme. We apply RoHM to a variety of tasks -- from motion reconstruction and denoising to spatial and temporal infilling.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Recently One-stage Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation (WSSS) with image-level labels has gained increasing interest due to simplification over its cumbersome multi-stage counterpart. Limited by the inherent ambiguity of Class Activation Map (CAM) we observe that one-stage pipelines often encounter confirmation bias caused by incorrect CAM pseudo-labels impairing their final segmentation performance. Although recent works discard many unreliable pseudo-labels to implicitly alleviate this issue they fail to exploit sufficient supervision for their models. To this end we propose a dual student framework with trustworthy progressive learning (DuPL). Specifically we propose a dual student network with a discrepancy loss to yield diverse CAMs for each sub-net. The two sub-nets generate supervision for each other mitigating the confirmation bias caused by learning their own incorrect pseudo-labels. In this process we progressively introduce more trustworthy pseudo-labels to be involved in the supervision through dynamic threshold adjustment with an adaptive noise filtering strategy. Moreover we believe that every pixel even discarded from supervision due to its unreliability is important for WSSS. Thus we develop consistency regularization on these discarded regions providing supervision of every pixel. Experiment results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed DuPL over the recent state-of-the-art alternatives on PASCAL VOC 2012 and MS COCO datasets.

However existing methods focus on the human appearance reconstruction of every single frame while the temporal motion relations are not fully explored. In this paper we propose a new 4D motion modeling paradigm SurMo that jointly models the temporal dynamics and human appearances in a unified framework with three key designs: 1) Surface-based motion encoding that models 4D human motions with an efficient compact surface-based triplane. It encodes both spatial and temporal motion relations on the dense surface manifold of a statistical body template which inherits body topology priors for generalizable novel view synthesis with sparse training observations. 2) Physical motion decoding that is designed to encourage physical motion learning by decoding the motion triplane features at timestep t to predict both spatial derivatives and temporal derivatives at the next timestep t+1 in the training stage. 3) 4D appearance decoding that renders the motion triplanes into images by an efficient volumetric surface-conditioned renderer that focuses on the rendering of body surfaces with motion learning conditioning. Extensive experiments validate the state-of-the-art performance of our new paradigm and illustrate the expressiveness of surface-based motion triplanes for rendering high-fidelity view-consistent humans with fast motions and even motion-dependent shadows.

We find that a naive extension of the self-attention proposed in prior work (e.g. MVDream) leads to content copying between views. Therefore we explicitly constrain the cross-view attention based on epipolar geometry. To further enhance 3D consistency we utilize Pl ?ucker coordinates derived from camera rays and inject them as positional encoding. This enables SPAD to reason over spatial proximity in 3D well. Compared to concurrent works that can only generate views at fixed azimuth and elevation (e.g. MVDream SyncDreamer) SPAD offers full camera control and achieves state-of-the-art results in novel view synthesis on unseen objects from the Objaverse and Google Scanned Objects datasets.

A major challenge of CIL arises when applying to real-world data characterized by non-uniform distribution which introduces a dual imbalance problem involving (i) disparities between stored exemplars of old tasks and new class data (inter-phase imbalance) and (ii) severe class imbalances within each individual task (intra-phase imbalance). We show that this dual imbalance issue causes skewed gradient updates with biased weights in FC layers thus inducing over/under-fitting and catastrophic forgetting in CIL. Our method addresses it by reweighting the gradients towards balanced optimization and unbiased classifier learning. Additionally we observe imbalanced forgetting where paradoxically the instance-rich classes suffer higher performance degradation during CIL due to a larger amount of training data becoming unavailable in subsequent learning phases. To tackle this we further introduce a distribution-aware knowledge distillation loss to mitigate forgetting by aligning output logits proportionally with the distribution of lost training data.

    "abstract": "Despite diffusion models having shown powerful abilities to generate photorealistic images generating videos that are realistic and diverse still remains in its infancy. One of the key reasons is that current methods intertwine spatial content and temporal dynamics together leading to a notably increased complexity of text-to-video generation (T2V). In this work we propose HiGen a diffusion model-based method that improves performance by decoupling the spatial and temporal factors of videos from two perspectives i.e. structure level and content level. At the structure level we decompose the T2V task into two steps including spatial reasoning and temporal reasoning using a unified denoiser. Specifically we generate spatially coherent priors using text during spatial reasoning and then generate temporally coherent motions from these priors during temporal reasoning. At the content level we extract two subtle cues from the content of the input video that can express motion and appearance changes respectively. These two cues then guide the model's training for generating videos enabling flexible content variations and enhancing temporal stability. Through the decoupled paradigm HiGen can effectively reduce the complexity of this task and generate realistic videos with semantics accuracy and motion stability. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of HiGen over the state-of-the-art T2V methods. We have released our source code and models",

Additionally we introduce the Layout-Free Prior Preservation (LFP) loss which leverages unlabeled data to maintain the priors of pre-trained models thereby improving the visual quality and semantic consistency of synthesized images. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach performs favorably in terms of visual quality semantic consistency and layout alignment.

    "abstract": "Self-supervised denoising has attracted widespread attention due to its ability to train without clean images. However noise in real-world scenarios is often spatially correlated which causes many self-supervised algorithms that assume pixel-wise independent noise to perform poorly. Recent works have attempted to break noise correlation with downsampling or neighborhood masking. However denoising on downsampled subgraphs can lead to aliasing effects and loss of details due to a lower sampling rate. Furthermore the neighborhood masking methods either come with high computational complexity or do not consider local spatial preservation during inference. Through the analysis of existing methods we point out that the key to obtaining high-quality and texture-rich results in real-world self-supervised denoising tasks is to train at the original input resolution structure and use asymmetric operations during training and inference. Based on this we propose Asymmetric Tunable Blind-Spot Network (AT-BSN) where the blind-spot size can be freely adjusted thus better balancing noise correlation suppression and image local spatial destruction during training and inference. In addition we regard the pre-trained AT-BSN as a meta-teacher network capable of generating various teacher networks by sampling different blind-spots. We propose a blind-spot based multi-teacher distillation strategy to distill a lightweight network significantly improving performance. Experimental results on multiple datasets prove that our method achieves state-of-the-art and is superior to other self-supervised algorithms in terms of computational overhead and visual effects",

Designed for challenging monocular settings our approach is seamlessly extendable to RGB-D SLAM when an external depth sensor is available. Several innovations are required to continuously reconstruct 3D scenes with high fidelity from a live camera. First to move beyond the original 3DGS algorithm which requires accurate poses from an offline Structure from Motion (SfM) system we formulate camera tracking for 3DGS using direct optimisation against the 3D Gaussians and show that this enables fast and robust tracking with a wide basin of convergence. Second by utilising the explicit nature of the Gaussians we introduce geometric verification and regularisation to handle the ambiguities occurring in incremental 3D dense reconstruction.

Thus we propose a metric tensor-based consistency regularization exploiting the class-variant geometrical structure of embeddings on the high-dimensional feature space. The proposed method not only minimizes the prediction discrepancy between different views of a given image but also estimates the intrinsic geometric curvature of embedding spaces by employing the global and local metric tensors. The global metric tensor is used to globally estimate the class-invariant embeddings from the whole data distribution while the local metric tensor is exploited to estimate the class-variant embeddings of each cluster. The two metric tensors are optimized by the consistency regularization based on the weak and strong augmentation strategy.

To this end we explore video-first architectures building on the common paradigm of transferring large-scale image--text models to video via shallow temporal fusion. However we expose two limitations to the approach: (1) decreased spatial capabilities likely due to poor video--language alignment in standard video datasets and (2) higher memory consumption bottlenecking the number of frames that can be processed. To mitigate the memory bottleneck we systematically analyze the memory/accuracy trade-off of various efficient methods: factorized attention parameter-efficient image-to-video adaptation input masking and multi-resolution patchification. Surprisingly simply masking large portions of the video (up to 75%) during contrastive pre-training proves to be one of the most robust ways to scale encoders to videos up to 4.3 minutes at 1 FPS. Our simple approach for training long video-to-text models which scales to 1B parameters does not add new architectural complexity and is able to outperform the popular paradigm of using much larger LLMs as an information aggregator over segment-based information on benchmarks with long-range temporal dependencies (YouCook2 EgoSchema)",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Two-view correspondence learning has recently focused on considering the coherence and smoothness of the motion field between an image pair. Dominant schemes include controlling the complexity of the field function with regularization or smoothing the field with local filters but the former suffers from heavy computational burden and the latter fails to accommodate discontinuities in the case of large scene disparities. In this paper inspired by Fourier expansion we propose a novel network called DeMatch which decomposes the motion field to retain its main \"low-frequency\" and smooth part. This achieves implicit regularization with lower computational cost and generates piecewise smoothness naturally. Specifically we first decompose the rough motion field that is contaminated by false matches into several different sub-fields which are highly smooth and contain the main energy of the original field. Then with these smooth sub-fields we recover a cleaner motion field from which correct motion vectors are subsequently derived. We also design a special masked decomposition strategy to further mitigate the negative influence of false matches. All the mentioned processes are finally implemented in a discrete and learnable manner avoiding the difficulty of calculating real dense fields. Extensive experiments reveal that DeMatch outperforms state-of-the-art methods in multiple tasks and shows promising low computational usage and piecewise smoothness property.

The factorised policy representation allows HDP to tackle both long-horizon task planning while generating fine-grained low-level actions. To generate context-aware motion trajectories while satisfying robot kinematics constraints we present a novel kinematics-aware goal-conditioned control agent Robot Kinematics Diffuser (RK-Diffuser). Specifically RK-Diffuser learns to generate both the end-effector pose and joint position trajectories and distill the accurate but kinematics-unaware end-effector pose diffuser to the kinematics-aware but less accurate joint position diffuser via differentiable kinematics.

In this work we propose a multi-scale network based on single-input and multiple-outputs(SIMO) for motion deblurring. This simplifies the complexity of algorithms based on a coarse-to-fine scheme. To alleviate restoration defects impacting detail information brought about by using a multi-scale architecture we combine the characteristics of real-world blurring trajectories with a learnable wavelet transform module to focus on the directional continuity and frequency features of the step-by-step transitions between blurred images to sharp images.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Temporal action detection (TAD) aims to locate action positions and recognize action categories in long-term untrimmed videos. Although many methods have achieved promising results their robustness has not been thoroughly studied. In practice we observe that temporal information in videos can be occasionally corrupted such as missing or blurred frames. Interestingly existing methods often incur a significant performance drop even if only one frame is affected. To formally evaluate the robustness we establish two temporal corruption robustness benchmarks namely THUMOS14-C and ActivityNet-v1.3-C. In this paper we extensively analyze the robustness of seven leading TAD methods and obtain some interesting findings: 1) Existing methods are particularly vulnerable to temporal corruptions and end-to-end methods are often more susceptible than those with a pre-trained feature extractor; 2) Vulnerability mainly comes from localization error rather than classification error; 3) When corruptions occur in the middle of an action instance TAD models tend to yield the largest performance drop. Besides building a benchmark we further develop a simple but effective robust training method to defend against temporal corruptions through the FrameDrop augmentation and Temporal-Robust Consistency loss. Remarkably our approach not only improves robustness but also yields promising improvements on clean data. We believe that this study will serve as a benchmark for future research in robust video analysis.

In response to these challenges we introduce Flexible Biometric Recognition (FBR) a novel framework designed to advance conventional face periocular and multimodal face-periocular biometrics across both intra- and cross-modality recognition tasks. FBR strategically utilizes the Multimodal Fusion Attention (MFA) and Multimodal Prompt Tuning (MPT) mechanisms within the Vision Transformer architecture. MFA facilitates the fusion of modalities ensuring cohesive alignment between facial and periocular embeddings while incorporating soft-biometrics to enhance the model's ability to discriminate between individuals. The fusion of three modalities is pivotal in exploring interrelationships between different modalities. Additionally MPT serves as a unifying bridge intertwining inputs and promoting cross-modality interactions while preserving their distinctive characteristics. The collaborative synergy of MFA and MPT enhances the shared features of the face and periocular with a specific emphasis on the ocular region yielding exceptional performance in both intra- and cross-modality recognition tasks.

MRCNet consists of two main components: multi-scale robust fusion (MRF) addresses pose noise by developing cross-semantic multi-scale enhanced aggregation to fuse features of different scales while motion enhanced mechanism (MEM) captures motion context to compensate for information blurring caused by moving objects. Experimental results on popular collaborative 3D object detection datasets demonstrate that MRCNet outperforms competing methods in noisy scenarios with improved perception performance using less bandwidth",

    "abstract": "In the past few decades Japanese comics commonly referred to as Manga have transcended both cultural and linguistic boundaries to become a true worldwide sensation. Yet the inherent reliance on visual cues and illustration within manga renders it largely inaccessible to individuals with visual impairments. In this work we seek to address this substantial barrier with the aim of ensuring that manga can be appreciated and actively engaged by everyone. Specifically we tackle the problem of diarisation i.e. generating a transcription of who said what and when in a fully automatic way. To this end we make the following contributions: (1) we present a unified model Magi that is able to (a) detect panels text boxes and character boxes (b) cluster characters by identity (without knowing the number of clusters apriori) and (c) associate dialogues to their speakers; (2) we propose a novel approach that is able to sort the detected text boxes in their reading order and generate a dialogue transcript; (3) we annotate an evaluation benchmark for this task using publicly available [English] manga pages",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Open-vocabulary object detection aims to detect novel categories that are independent from the base categories used during training. Most modern methods adhere to the paradigm of learning vision-language space from a large-scale multi-modal corpus and subsequently transferring the acquired knowledge to off-the-shelf detectors like Faster-RCNN. However information attenuation or destruction may occur during the process of knowledge transfer due to the domain gap hampering the generalization ability on novel categories. To mitigate this predicament in this paper we present a novel framework named BIND standing for Bulit-IN Detector to eliminate the need for module replacement or knowledge transfer to off-the-shelf detectors. Specifically we design a two-stage training framework with an Encoder-Decoder structure. In the first stage an image-text dual encoder is trained to learn region-word alignment from a corpus of image-text pairs. In the second stage a DETR-style decoder is trained to perform detection on annotated object detection datasets. In contrast to conventional manually designed non-adaptive anchors which generate numerous redundant proposals we develop an anchor proposal network that generates anchor proposals with high likelihood based on candidates adaptively thereby substantially improving detection efficiency. Experimental results on two public benchmarks COCO and LVIS demonstrate that our method stands as a state-of-the-art approach for open-vocabulary object detection",

Transformers and ConvNeXt are found to be more compositional in the sense that they jointly consider multiple parts of the image in building their decisions whereas traditional CNNs and distilled transformers are less compositional and more disjunctive which means that they use multiple diverse but smaller set of parts to achieve a confident prediction. Through further experiments we pinpointed the choice of normalization to be especially important in the compositionality of a model in that batch normalization leads to less compositionality while group and layer normalization lead to more.

One of the biggest challenges to this task is the one-to-many mapping from sparse observations to dense full-body motions which endowed inherent ambiguities. To help resolve this ambiguous problem we introduce a new framework to combine rich contextual information provided by scenes to benefit full-body motion tracking from sparse observations.

The sampling procedure of \\text S ^2Fusion is further guided by a specially designed scene-penetration loss and phase-matching loss which effectively regularizes the motion of the lower body even in the absence of any tracking signals making the generated motion much more plausible and coherent.

The existing SDG approaches are mainly for image classification and segmentation and can hardly be extended to our case due to its regression nature and label ambiguity (i.e. ambiguous pixel-level ground truths). We propose MPCount a novel effective SDG approach even for narrow source distribution. MPCount stores diverse density values for density map regression and reconstructs domain-invariant features by means of only one memory bank a content error mask and attention consistency loss. By partitioning the image into grids it employs patch-wise classification as an auxiliary task to mitigate label ambiguity. Through extensive experiments on different datasets MPCount is shown to significantly improve counting accuracy compared to the state of the art under diverse scenarios unobserved in the training data characterized by narrow source distribution.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Monocular depth estimation has experienced significant progress on terrestrial images in recent years thanks to deep learning advancements. But it remains inadequate for underwater scenes primarily due to data scarcity. Given the inherent challenges of light attenuation and backscatter in water acquiring clear underwater images or precise depth is notably difficult and costly. To mitigate this issue learning-based approaches often rely on synthetic data or turn to self- or unsupervised manners. Nonetheless their performance is often hindered by domain gap and looser constraints. In this paper we propose a novel pipeline for generating photorealistic underwater images using accurate terrestrial depth. This approach facilitates the supervised training of models for underwater depth estimation effectively reducing the performance disparity between terrestrial and underwater environments. Contrary to previous synthetic datasets that merely apply style transfer to terrestrial images without scene content change our approach uniquely creates vivid non-existent underwater scenes by leveraging terrestrial depth data through the innovative Stable Diffusion model. Specifically we introduce a specialized Depth2Underwater ControlNet trained on prepared \\ Underwater Depth Text\\ data triplets for this generation task. Our newly developed dataset Atlantis enables terrestrial depth estimation models to achieve considerable improvements on unseen underwater scenes surpassing their terrestrial pretrained counterparts both quantitatively and qualitatively. Moreover we further show its practical utility by applying the improved depth in underwater image enhancement and its smaller domain gap from the LLVM perspective.

    "abstract": "The robust association of the same objects across video frames in complex scenes is crucial for many applications especially object tracking. Current methods predominantly rely on labeled domain-specific video datasets which limits cross-domain generalization of learned similarity embeddings. We propose MASA a novel method for robust instance association learning capable of matching any objects within videos across diverse domains without tracking labels. Leveraging the rich object segmentation from the Segment Anything Model (SAM) MASA learns instance-level correspondence through exhausive data transformations. We treat the SAM outputs as dense object region proposals and learn to match those regions from a vast image collection. We further design a universal MASA adapter which can work in tandem with foundational segmentation or detection models and enable them to track any detected objects. Those combinations present strong zero-shot tracking ability in complex domains. Extensive tests on multiple challenging MOT and MOTS benchmarks indicate that the proposed method using only unlabelled static images achieves even better performance than state-of-the-art methods trained with fully annotated in-domain video sequences in zero-shot association.

It learns such negative prompts with ID data only without any reliance on external outlier data. Further current methods assume the availability of samples of all ID classes rendering them ineffective in open-vocabulary learning scenarios where the inference stage can contain novel ID classes not present during training. In contrast our learned negative prompts are transferable to novel class labels. Experiments on various ImageNet benchmarks show that NegPrompt surpasses state-of-the-art prompt-learning-based OOD detection methods and maintains a consistent lead in hard OOD detection in closed- and open-vocabulary classification scenarios.

The majority of recent research on adversarial robustness however has predominantly focused on CNNs. In this work we bridge this gap by analyzing the effectiveness of existing attacks on VITs. We demonstrate that due to the softmax computations in every attention block in VITs they are inherently vulnerable to floating point underflow errors. This can lead to a gradient masking effect resulting in suboptimal attack strength of well-known attacks like PGD Carlini and Wagner (CW) GAMA and Patch attacks. Motivated by this we propose Adaptive Attention Scaling (AAS) attack that can automatically find the optimal scaling factors of pre-softmax outputs using gradient-based optimization. We show that the proposed simple strategy can be incorporated with any existing adversarial attacks as well as adversarial training methods and achieved improved performance. On VIT-B16 we demonstrate an improved attack strength of upto 2.2% on CIFAR10 and upto 2.9% on CIFAR100 by incorporating the proposed AAS attack with state-of-the-art single attack methods like GAMA attack. Further we utilise the proposed AAS attack for every few epochs in existing adversarial training methods which is termed as Adaptive Attention Scaling Adversarial Training (AAS-AT). On incorporating AAS-AT with existing methods we outperform them on VITs over 1.3-3.5% on CIFAR10. We observe improved performance on ImageNet-100 as well",

Event streams have high temporal resolution and provide reliable cues for 3D human motion capture under high-speed human motions and rapidly changing illumination. The proposed EE3D framework is specifically tailored for learning with event streams in the LNES representation enabling high 3D reconstruction accuracy. We also design a prototype of a mobile head-mounted device with an event camera and record a real dataset with event observations and the ground-truth 3D human poses (in addition to the synthetic dataset).

In this paper we propose a novel robustness enhancement framework by first learning the concept of the co-salient objects based on the input group images and then leveraging this concept to purify adversarial perturbations which are subsequently fed to CoSODs for robustness enhancement. Specifically we propose CosalPure containing two modules i.e. group-image concept learning and concept-guided diffusion purification. For the first module we adopt a pre-trained text-to-image diffusion model to learn the concept of co-salient objects within group images where the learned concept is robust to adversarial examples. For the second module we map the adversarial image to the latent space and then perform diffusion generation by embedding the learned concept into the noise prediction function as an extra condition. Our method can effectively alleviate the influence of the SOTA adversarial attack containing different adversarial patterns including exposure and noise.

The objective is to make the two decoupled tasks assist each other and eventually improve the action anticipation task.

Generation of simulated data is a feasible alternative to retrieving large style-diverse real-world datasets as it is a cumbersome and budget-intensive process. However the large domain-specific inconsistencies between simulated and real-world data pose a significant generalization challenge in semantic segmentation. In this work to alleviate this problem we propose a novel Multi-Resolution Feature Perturbation (MRFP) technique to randomize domain-specific fine-grained features and perturb style of coarse features. Our experimental results on various urban-scene segmentation datasets clearly indicate that along with the perturbation of style-information perturbation of fine-feature components is paramount to learn domain invariant robust feature maps for semantic segmentation models. MRFP is a simple and computationally efficient transferable module with no additional learnable parameters or objective functions that helps state-of-the-art deep neural networks to learn robust domain invariant features for simulation-to-real semantic segmentation.

Our key insight lies in introducing additional temporal cues besides the provided reference. To this end we generate temporal pseudo-references from the given stylized reference. These pseudo-references facilitate the propagation of style information from the reference to the entire dynamic 3D scene. For coarse style transfer we enforce novel views and times to mimic the style details present in pseudo-references at the feature level. To preserve high-frequency details we create a collection of stylized temporal pseudo-rays from temporal pseudo-references. These pseudo-rays serve as detailed and explicit stylization guidance for achieving fine style transfer.

While ControlNet enables direct generation based on skeleton poses it encounters challenges when modifying the source motion in the inverted noise due to contradictory signals between the noise (source) and the condition (reference). Our adapter complements ControlNet by involving source content to transfer adapted control signals seamlessly.

This mechanism enables the editing branch to query the key and value from the reconstruction branch in a decoupled manner making the editing branch retain the original background and protagonist appearance. We also propose a skeleton alignment algorithm to address the discrepancies in pose size and position.

    "abstract": "It is a well-known fact that the performance of deep learning models deteriorates when they encounter a distribution shift at test time. Test-time adaptation (TTA) algorithms have been proposed to adapt the model online while inferring test data. However existing research predominantly focuses on classification tasks through the optimization of batch normalization layers or classification heads but this approach limits its applicability to various model architectures like Transformers and makes it challenging to apply to other tasks such as object detection. In this paper we propose a novel online adaption approach for object detection in continually changing test domains considering which part of the model to update how to update it and when to perform the update. By introducing architecture-agnostic and lightweight adaptor modules and only updating these while leaving the pre-trained backbone unchanged we can rapidly adapt to new test domains in an efficient way and prevent catastrophic forgetting. Furthermore we present a practical and straightforward class-wise feature aligning method for object detection to resolve domain shifts. Additionally we enhance efficiency by determining when the model is sufficiently adapted or when additional adaptation is needed due to changes in the test distribution. Our approach surpasses baselines on widely used benchmarks achieving improvements of up to 4.9%p and 7.9%p in mAP for COCO ?

To bridge the gap this work proposes a simple and effective probabilistic model ensemble framework based on Gaussian processes which have previously demonstrated remarkable efficacy in processing small data.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "We study text-based image editing (TBIE) of a single image by counterfactual inference because it is an elegant formulation to precisely address the requirement: the edited image should retain the fidelity of the original one. Through the lens of the formulation we find that the crux of TBIE is that existing techniques hardly achieve a good trade-off between editability and fidelity mainly due to the overfitting of the single-image fine-tuning. To this end we propose a Doubly Abductive Counterfactual inference framework (DAC). We first parameterize an exogenous variable as a UNet LoRA whose abduction can encode all the image details. Second we abduct another exogenous variable parameterized by a text encoder LoRA which recovers the lost editability caused by the overfitted first abduction. Thanks to the second abduction which exclusively encodes the visual transition from post-edit to pre-edit its inversion---subtracting the LoRA---effectively reverts pre-edit back to post-edit thereby accomplishing the edit. Through extensive experiments our DAC achieves a good trade-off between editability and fidelity. Thus we can support a wide spectrum of user editing intents including addition removal manipulation replacement style transfer and facial change which are extensively validated in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations.

We re-think this approach and suggest that both object detection as well as motion-inspired pseudo-labeling can be tackled in a data-driven manner. We leverage recent advances in scene flow estimation to obtain point trajectories from which we extract long-term class-agnostic motion patterns. Revisiting correlation clustering in the context of message passing networks we learn to group those motion patterns to cluster points to object instances. By estimating the full extent of the objects we obtain per-scan 3D bounding boxes that we use to supervise a Lidar object detection network. Our method not only outperforms prior heuristic-based approaches (57.5 AP +14 improvement over prior work) more importantly we show we can pseudo-label and train object detectors across datasets",

To bridge this gap we propose a novel framework unifying adversarially robust similarity learning and class concept learning. Specifically we distill parameters from both network branches into a \"unified embedding model\" during robust optimization and redistribute them to individual network branches periodically. To capture generalizable robustness across diverse branches we initialize adversaries in each episode with cross-branch class-wise \"global adversarial perturbations\" instead of less informative random initialization. We also propose a branch robustness harmonization to modulate the optimization of similarity and class concept learners via their relative adversarial robustness.

Despite advancements current methods easily suffer the distractors or heavy object appearance variations in videos due to insufficient object information from the text leading to degradation. Addressing this we propose a novel framework context-guided STVG (CG-STVG) which mines discriminative instance context for object in videos and applies it as a supplementary guidance for target localization. The key of CG-STVG lies in two specially designed modules including instance context generation (ICG) which focuses on discovering visual context information (in both appearance and motion) of the instance and instance context refinement (ICR) which aims to improve the instance context from ICG by eliminating irrelevant or even harmful information from the context. During grounding ICG together with ICR are deployed at each decoding stage of a Transformer architecture for instance context learning. Particularly instance context learned from one decoding stage is fed to the next stage and leveraged as a guidance containing rich and discriminative object feature to enhance the target-awareness in decoding feature which conversely benefits generating better new instance context for improving localization finally. Compared to existing methods CG-STVG enjoys object information in text query and guidance from mined instance visual context for more accurate target localization. In our experiments on three benchmarks including HCSTVG-v1/-v2 and VidSTG CG-STVG sets new state-of-the-arts in m_tIoU and m_vIoU on all of them showing efficacy.

First we argue that video networks and datasets are not necessary for anime SR due to the repetition use of hand-drawing frames. Instead we propose an anime image collection pipeline by choosing the least compressed and the most informative frames from the video sources. Based on this pipeline we introduce the Anime Production-oriented Image (API) dataset. In addition we identify two anime-specific challenges of distorted and faint hand-drawn lines and unwanted color artifacts. We address the first issue by introducing a prediction-oriented compression module in the image degradation model and a pseudo-ground truth preparation with enhanced hand-drawn lines. In addition we introduce the balanced twin perceptual loss combining both anime and photorealistic high-level features to mitigate unwanted color artifacts and increase visual clarity.

In particular calibrating the light directions for each view significantly increases the cost of acquiring images. To make MVPS more accessible we introduce a practical and easy-to-implement setup multi-view constrained photometric stereo (MVCPS) where the light directions are unknown but constrained to move together with the camera. Unlike conventional multi-view uncalibrated photometric stereo our constrained setting reduces the ambiguities of surface normal estimates from per-view linear ambiguities to a single and global linear one thereby simplifying the disambiguation process. The proposed method integrates the ambiguous surface normal into neural surface reconstruction (NeuS) to simultaneously resolve the global ambiguity and estimate the detailed 3D shape.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Recent advancements in multimodal pre-training have shown promising efficacy in 3D representation learning by aligning multimodal features across 3D shapes their 2D counterparts and language descriptions. However the methods used by existing frameworks to curate such multimodal data in particular language descriptions for 3D shapes are not scalable and the collected language descriptions are not diverse. To address this we introduce ULIP-2 a simple yet effective tri-modal pretraining framework that leverages large multimodal models to automatically generate holistic language descriptions for 3D shapes. It only needs 3D data as input eliminating the need for any manual 3D annotations and is therefore scalable to large datasets. ULIP-2 is also equipped with scaled-up backbones for better multi-modal representation learning. We conduct experiments on two large-scale 3D datasets Objaverse and ShapeNet and augment them with tri-modal datasets of 3D point clouds images and language for training ULIP-2. Experiments show that ULIP-2 demonstrates substantial benefits in three downstream tasks: zero-shot 3D classification standard 3D classification with fine-tuning and 3D captioning (3D-to-language generation). It achieves a new SOTA of 50.6% (top- 1) on Objaverse-LVIS and 84.7% (top-1) on ModelNet40 in zero-shot classification. In the ScanObjectNN benchmark for standard fine-tuning ULIP-2 reaches an overall accuracy of 91.5% with a compact model of only 1.4 million parameters. ULIP-2 sheds light on a new paradigm for scalable multimodal 3D representation learning without human annotations and shows significant improvements over existing baselines.

    "abstract": "Three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction from a single image is an ill-posed problem with inherent ambiguities i.e. scale. Predicting a 3D scene from text description(s) is similarly ill-posed i.e. spatial arrangements of objects described. We investigate the question of whether two inherently ambiguous modalities can be used in conjunction to produce metric-scaled reconstructions. To test this we focus on monocular depth estimation the problem of predicting a dense depth map from a single image but with an additional text caption describing the scene. To this end we begin by encoding the text caption as a mean and standard deviation; using a variational framework we learn the distribution of the plausible metric reconstructions of 3D scenes corresponding to the text captions as a prior. To \"select\" a specific reconstruction or depth map we encode the given image through a conditional sampler that samples from the latent space of the variational text encoder which is then decoded to the output depth map. Our approach is trained alternatingly between the text and image branches: in one optimization step we predict the mean and standard deviation from the text description and sample from a standard Gaussian and in the other we sample using a (image) conditional sampler. Once trained we directly predict depth from the encoded text using the conditional sampler. We demonstrate our approach on indoor (NYUv2) and outdoor (KITTI) scenarios where we show that language can consistently improve performance in both. Code: https://github.com/Adonis-galaxy/WorDepth",

However existing personalized generation methods cannot simultaneously satisfy the requirements of high efficiency promising identity (ID) fidelity and flexible text controllability. In this work we introduce PhotoMaker an efficient personalized text-to-image generation method which mainly encodes an arbitrary number of input ID images into a stack ID embedding for preserving ID information. Such an embedding also empowers our method to be applied in many interesting scenarios such as when replacing the corresponding class word and when combining the characteristics of different identities. Besides to better drive the training of our PhotoMaker we propose an ID-oriented data creation pipeline to assemble the training data. Under the nourishment of the dataset constructed through the proposed pipeline our PhotoMaker demonstrates comparable performance to test-time fine-tuning-based methods yet provides significant speed improvements strong generalization capabilities and a wide range of applications",

These inverse problems involve fitting a human body model to image observations traditionally solved through optimization techniques.

The diffusion model is trained to capture the conditional distribution of the human model parameters given an input image. By guiding its denoising process with a task-specific score ScoreHMR effectively solves inverse problems for various applications without the need for retraining the task-agnostic diffusion model. We evaluate our approach on three settings/applications. These are: (i) single-frame model fitting; (ii) reconstruction from multiple uncalibrated views; (iii) reconstructing humans in video sequences.

Then by moving the located activations and making intra- and inter-map adjustments the rectification process can be performed with negligible computational overhead.

    "abstract": "Unpaired image dehazing (UID) holds significant research importance due to the challenges in acquiring haze/clear image pairs with identical backgrounds. This paper proposes a novel method for UID named Orthogonal Decoupling Contrastive Regularization (ODCR). Our method is grounded in the assumption that an image consists of both haze-related features which influence the degree of haze and haze-unrelated features such as texture and semantic information. ODCR aims to ensure that the haze-related features of the dehazing result closely resemble those of the clear image while the haze-unrelated features align with the input hazy image. To accomplish the motivation Orthogonal MLPs optimized geometrically on the Stiefel manifold are proposed which can project image features into an orthogonal space thereby reducing the relevance between different features. Furthermore a task-driven Depth-wise Feature Classifier (DWFC) is proposed which assigns weights to the orthogonal features based on the contribution of each channel's feature in predicting whether the feature source is hazy or clear in a self-supervised fashion. Finally a Weighted PatchNCE (WPNCE) loss is introduced to achieve the pulling of haze-related features in the output image toward those of clear images while bringing haze-unrelated features close to those of the hazy input. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of our ODCR method on UID",

The key insight is to lift multi-view inconsistent 2D segmentations into a consistent 3D feature field through a hierarchical contrastive learning framework which is accomplished by two steps. Firstly we design a novel hierarchical representation based on category-agnostic 2D segmentations to model the multi-level relationship among pixels. Secondly image features rendered from the 3D feature field are clustered at different levels which can be further drawn closer or pushed apart according to the hierarchical relationship between different levels. In tackling the challenges posed by inconsistent 2D segmentations this framework yields a global consistent 3D feature field which further enables hierarchical segmentation multi-object selection and global discretization.

    "abstract": "Many problems in computer vision can be formulated as geometric estimation problems i.e. given a collection of measurements (e.g. point correspondences) we wish to fit a model (e.g. an essential matrix) that agrees with our observations. This necessitates some measure of how much an observation \"agrees\" with a given model. A natural choice is to consider the smallest perturbation that makes the observation exactly satisfy the constraints. However for many problems this metric is expensive or otherwise intractable to compute. The so-called Sampson error approximates this geometric error through a linearization scheme. For epipolar geometry the Sampson error is a popular choice and in practice known to yield very tight approximations of the corresponding geometric residual (the reprojection error). In this paper we revisit the Sampson approximation and provide new theoretical insights as to why and when this approximation works as well as provide explicit bounds on the tightness under some mild assumptions. Our theoretical results are validated in several experiments on real data and in the context of different geometric estimation tasks",

Several works exploit semantics and design complicated semantic fusion mechanisms to compensate for rare representative features within restricted data. However relying on naive semantics such as class names introduces biases due to their brevity while acquiring extensive semantics from external knowledge takes a huge time and effort. This limitation severely constrains the potential of semantics in Few-Shot Learning. In this paper we design an automatic way called Semantic Evolution to generate high-quality semantics. The incorporation of high-quality semantics alleviates the need for complex network structures and learning algorithms used in previous works. Hence we employ a simple two-layer network termed Semantic Alignment Network to transform semantics and visual features into robust class prototypes with rich discriminative features for few-shot classification. The experimental results show our framework outperforms all previous methods on six benchmarks demonstrating a simple network with high-quality semantics can beat intricate multi-modal modules on few-shot classification tasks.

The EFCR addresses the data deficiency problem by exploring latent deblur signals from different frequency bands. It also enables deblur knowledge transfer to learn cross-domain information from extra data improving deblur performance for labeled and unlabeled data.

    "abstract": "CLIP showcases exceptional cross-modal matching capabilities due to its training on image-text contrastive learning tasks. However without specific optimization for unimodal scenarios its performance in single-modality feature extraction might be suboptimal. Despite this some studies have directly used CLIP's image encoder for tasks like few-shot classification introducing a misalignment between its pre-training objectives and feature extraction methods. This inconsistency can diminish the quality of the image's feature representation adversely affecting CLIP's effectiveness in target tasks. In this paper we view text features as precise neighbors of image features in CLIP's space and present a novel CrOss-moDal nEighbor Representation (CODER) based on the distance structure between images and their neighbor texts. This feature extraction method aligns better with CLIP's pre-training objectives thereby fully leveraging CLIP's robust cross-modal capabilities. The key to construct a high-quality CODER lies in how to create a vast amount of high-quality and diverse texts to match with images. We introduce the Auto Text Generator (ATG) to automatically produce the required text in a data-free and training-free manner. We apply CODER to CLIP's zero-shot and few-shot image classification tasks. Experiment results across various datasets and models confirm CODER's effectiveness.

    "abstract": "Deep neural networks are vulnerable to adversarial attacks leading to erroneous outputs. Adversarial training has been recognized as one of the most effective methods to counter such attacks. However existing adversarial training techniques have predominantly been evaluated on balanced datasets whereas real-world data often exhibit a long-tailed distribution casting doubt on the efficacy of these methods in practical scenarios. In this paper we delve into the performance of adversarial training under long-tailed distributions. Through an analysis of the prior method \"RoBal\" (Wu et al. CVPR'21) we discover that utilizing Balanced Softmax Loss (BSL) alone can obtain comparable performance to the complete RoBal approach while significantly reducing the training overhead. Then we reveal that adversarial training under long-tailed distributions also suffers from robust overfitting similar to uniform distributions. We explore utilizing data augmentation to mitigate this issue and unexpectedly discover that unlike results obtained with balanced data data augmentation not only effectively alleviates robust overfitting but also significantly improves robustness. We further identify that the improvement is attributed to the increased diversity of training data. Extensive experiments further corroborate that data augmentation alone can significantly improve robustness. Finally building on these findings we demonstrate that compared to RoBal the combination of BSL and data augmentation leads to a +6.66% improvement in model robustness under AutoAttack on CIFAR-10-LT.

    "abstract": "Vision-Language Models (VLMs) such as Flamingo and GPT-4V have shown immense potential by integrating large language models with vision systems. Nevertheless these models face challenges in the fundamental computer vision task of object localisation due to their training on multimodal data containing mostly captions without explicit spatial grounding. While it is possible to construct custom supervised training pipelines with bounding box annotations that integrate with VLMs these result in specialized and hard-to-scale models. In this paper we aim to explore the limits of caption-based VLMs and instead propose to tackle the challenge in a simpler manner by i) keeping the weights of a caption-based VLM frozen and ii) not using any supervised detection data. To this end we introduce an input-agnostic Positional Insert (PIN) a learnable spatial prompt containing a minimal set of parameters that are slid inside the frozen VLM unlocking object localisation capabilities. Our PIN module is trained with a simple next-token prediction task on synthetic data without requiring the introduction of new output heads. Our experiments demonstrate strong zero-shot localisation performances on a variety of images including Pascal VOC COCO LVIS and diverse images like paintings or cartoons",

    "abstract": "Garment manipulation (e.g. unfolding folding and hanging clothes) is essential for future robots to accomplish home-assistant tasks while highly challenging due to the diversity of garment configurations geometries and deformations. Although able to manipulate similar shaped garments in a certain task previous works mostly have to design different policies for different tasks could not generalize to garments with diverse geometries and often rely heavily on human-annotated data. In this paper we leverage the property that garments in a certain category have similar structures and then learn the topological dense (point-level) visual correspondence among garments in the category level with different deformations in the self-supervised manner. The topological correspondence can be easily adapted to the functional correspondence to guide the manipulation policies for various downstream tasks within only one or few-shot demonstrations. Experiments over garments in 3 different categories on 3 representative tasks in diverse scenarios using one or two arms taking one or more steps inputting flat or messy garments demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method.

    "abstract": "3D visual grounding aims to localize 3D objects described by free-form language sentences. Following the detection-then-matching paradigm existing methods mainly focus on embedding object attributes in unimodal feature extraction and multimodal feature fusion to enhance the discriminability of the proposal feature for accurate grounding. However most of them ignore the explicit interaction of multiple attributes causing a bias in unimodal representation and misalignment in multimodal fusion. In this paper we propose a multi-attribute aware Transformer for 3D visual grounding learning the multi-attribute interactions to refine the intra-modal and inter-modal grounding cues. Specifically we first develop an attribute causal analysis module to quantify the causal effect of different attributes for the final prediction which provides powerful supervision to correct the misleading attributes and adaptively capture other discriminative features. Then we design an exchanging-based multimodal fusion module which dynamically replaces tokens with low attribute attention between modalities before directly integrating low-dimensional global features. This ensures an attribute-level multimodal information fusion and helps align the language and vision details more efficiently for fine-grained multimodal features.

While attention control has proven effective for image editing with pre-trained image generation models there are currently no large-scale video generation models publicly available. Video-P2P addresses this limitation by adapting an image generation diffusion model to complete various video editing tasks. Specifically we propose to first tune a Text-to-Set (T2S) model to complete an approximate inversion and then optimize a shared unconditional embedding to achieve accurate video inversion with a small memory cost. We further prove that it is crucial for consistent video editing. For attention control we introduce a novel decoupled-guidance strategy which uses different guidance strategies for the source and target prompts. The optimized unconditional embedding for the source prompt improves reconstruction ability while an initialized unconditional embedding for the target prompt enhances editability. Incorporating the attention maps of these two branches enables detailed editing. These technical designs enable various text-driven editing applications including word swap prompt refinement and attention re-weighting.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Recent weakly supervised semantic segmentation (WSSS) methods strive to incorporate contextual knowledge to improve the completeness of class activation maps (CAM). In this work we argue that the knowledge bias between instances and contexts affects the capability of the prototype to sufficiently understand instance semantics. Inspired by prototype learning theory we propose leveraging prototype awareness to capture diverse and fine-grained feature attributes of instances. The hypothesis is that contextual prototypes might erroneously activate similar and frequently co-occurring object categories due to this knowledge bias. Therefore we propose to enhance the prototype representation ability by mitigating the bias to better capture spatial coverage in semantic object regions. With this goal we present a Context Prototype-Aware Learning (CPAL) strategy which leverages semantic context to enrich instance comprehension. The core of this method is to accurately capture intra-class variations in object features through context-aware prototypes facilitating the adaptation to the semantic attributes of various instances. We design feature distribution alignment to optimize prototype awareness aligning instance feature distributions with dense features. In addition a unified training framework is proposed to combine label-guided classification supervision and prototypes-guided self-supervision. Experimental results on PASCAL VOC 2012 and MS COCO 2014 show that CPAL significantly improves off-the-shelf methods and achieves state-of-the-art performance.

    "abstract": "In this paper we explore the potential of Snapshot Com- pressive Imaging (SCI) technique for recovering the under- lying 3D scene representation from a single temporal com- pressed image. SCI is a cost-effective method that enables the recording of high-dimensional data such as hyperspec- tral or temporal information into a single image using low- cost 2D imaging sensors. To achieve this a series of spe- cially designed 2D masks are usually employed which not only reduces storage requirements but also offers potential privacy protection. Inspired by this to take one step further our approach builds upon the powerful 3D scene represen- tation capabilities of neural radiance fields (NeRF). Specif- ically we formulate the physical imaging process of SCI as part of the training of NeRF allowing us to exploit its impressive performance in capturing complex scene struc- tures. To assess the effectiveness of our method we con- duct extensive evaluations using both synthetic data and real data captured by our SCI system. Extensive experi- mental results demonstrate that our proposed approach sur- passes the state-of-the-art methods in terms of image re- construction and novel view image synthesis. Moreover our method also exhibits the ability to restore high frame- rate multi-view consistent images by leveraging SCI and the rendering capabilities of NeRF.

A quadratic generalized moving least square is employed to capture nonlinear dynamics and large deformation on the implicit model. Such meshless integration enables versatile simulations of complex and codimensional shapes. We adaptively place the least-square kernels according to the NeRF density field to significantly reduce the complexity of the nonlinear simulation.

Our work shows that the localization --\"grounding'\"-- abilities of these models can be further improved by finetuning for self-consistent visual explanations. We propose a strategy for augmenting existing text-image datasets with paraphrases using a large language model and SelfEQ a weakly-supervised strategy on visual explanation maps for paraphrases that encourages self-consistency. Specifically for an input textual phrase we attempt to generate a paraphrase and finetune the model so that the phrase and paraphrase map to the same region in the image. We posit that this both expands the vocabulary that the model is able to handle and improves the quality of the object locations highlighted by gradient-based visual explanation methods (e.g. GradCAM). We demonstrate that SelfEQ improves performance on Flickr30k ReferIt and RefCOCO+ over a strong baseline method and several prior works. Particularly comparing to other methods that do not use any type of box annotations we obtain 84.07% on Flickr30k (an absolute improvement of 4.69%) 67.40% on ReferIt (an absolute improvement of 7.68%) and 75.10% 55.49% on RefCOCO+ test sets A and B respectively (an absolute improvement of 3.74% on average)",

    "abstract": "Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have shown promise in vision-language tasks but struggle with high-resolution input and detailed scene understanding. Addressing these challenges we introduce Monkey to enhance LMM capabilities. Firstly Monkey processes input images by dividing them into uniform patches each matching the size (e.g. 448x448) used in the original training of the well-trained vision encoder. Equipped with individual adapter for each patch Monkey can handle higher resolutions up to 1344x896 pixels enabling the detailed capture of complex visual information. Secondly it employs a multi-level description generation method enriching the context for scene-object associations. This two-part strategy ensures more effective learning from generated data: the higher resolution allows for a more detailed capture of visuals which in turn enhances the effectiveness of comprehensive descriptions. Extensive ablative results validate the effectiveness of our designs. Additionally experiments on 18 datasets further demonstrate that Monkey surpasses existing LMMs in many tasks like Image Captioning and various Visual Question Answering formats.

However previous works commonly suffer from unreliable correlation caused by locally constrained searching ranges and struggle with accumulated inaccuracy arising from the coarse-to-fine structure. To alleviate these problems we propose a novel uncertainty-aware scene flow estimation network (DifFlow3D) with the diffusion probabilistic model. Iterative diffusion-based refinement is designed to enhance the correlation robustness and resilience to challenging cases e.g. dynamics noisy inputs repetitive patterns etc. To restrain the generation diversity three key flow-related features are leveraged as conditions in our diffusion model. Furthermore we also develop an uncertainty estimation module within diffusion to evaluate the reliability of estimated scene flow. Our DifFlow3D achieves state-of-the-art performance with 24.0% and 29.1% EPE3D reduction respectively on FlyingThings3D and KITTI 2015 datasets. Notably our method achieves an unprecedented millimeter-level accuracy (0.0078m in EPE3D) on the KITTI dataset.

    "abstract": "While standard Empirical Risk Minimization (ERM) training is proven effective for image classification on in-distribution data it fails to perform well on out-of-distribution samples. One of the main sources of distribution shift for image classification is the compositional nature of images. Specifically in addition to the main object or component(s) determining the label some other image components usually exist which may lead to the shift of input distribution between train and test environments. More importantly these components may have spurious correlations with the label. To address this issue we propose Decompose-and-Compose (DaC) which improves robustness to correlation shift by a compositional approach based on combining elements of images. Based on our observations models trained with ERM usually highly attend to either the causal components or the components having a high spurious correlation with the label (especially in datapoints on which models have a high confidence). In fact according to the amount of spurious correlation and the easiness of classification based on the causal or non-causal components the model usually attends to one of these more (on samples with high confidence). Following this we first try to identify the causal components of images using class activation maps of models trained with ERM. Afterward we intervene on images by combining them and retraining the model on the augmented data including the counterfactual ones. This work proposes a group-balancing method by intervening on images without requiring group labels or information regarding the spurious features during training. The method has an overall better worst group accuracy compared to previous methods with the same amount of supervision on the group labels in correlation shift.

Evaluating the quality of the generative models is one essential step in the development process. Unfortunately the evaluation process could consume a significant amount of computational resources making the required periodic evaluation of model performance (e.g. monitoring training progress) impractical. Therefore we seek to improve the evaluation efficiency by selecting the representative subset of the text-image dataset. We systematically investigate the design choices including the selection criteria (textural features or imagebased metrics) and the selection granularity (prompt-level or set-level). We find that the insights from prior work on subset selection for training data do not generalize to this problem and we propose FlashEval an iterative search algorithm tailored to evaluation data selection. We demonstrate the effectiveness of FlashEval on ranking diffusion models with various configurations including architectures quantization levels and sampler schedules on COCO and DiffusionDB datasets. Our searched 50-item subset could achieve comparable evaluation quality to the randomly sampled 500-item subset for COCO annotations on unseen models achieving a 10x evaluation speedup.

The proposed method is independent of training data and noise distribution. Guided by illumination we integrate denoising and enhancing processes seamlessly enabling end-to-end training. Pairs of downsampled images are extracted from a single original low-light image and processed to preliminarily reduce noise. Based on the smoothness of illumination near-authentic illumination can be estimated from the denoised low-light image. Specifically the illumination is constrained by the denoised image's brightness uniformly amplifying pixels to raise overall brightness to normal-light level. We simultaneously restrict the illumination by scaling each pixel of the denoised image based on its intensity controlling the enhancement amplitude for different pixels. Applying the illumination to the original low-light image yields an adaptively enhanced reflection. This prevents under-enhancement and localized overexposure. Notably we concatenate the reflection with the illumination preserving their computational relationship to ultimately remove noise from the original low-light image in the form of reflection. This provides sufficient image information for the denoising procedure without changing the noise characteristics.

We propose a Top-to-Ground Aggregation module that capitalizes aerial orthographic views to aggregate features down to the ground level leveraging reliable off-ground information to improve feature alignment. Furthermore we introduce a Cycle Domain Adaptation loss that ensures feature extraction robustness across domain changes. Additionally an Equidistant Re-projection loss is introduced to equalize the impact of all keypoints on orientation error leading to a more extended distribution of keypoints which benefits orientation estimation. On both KITTI and Ford Multi-AV datasets our method consistently achieves the lowest mean longitudinal and lateral translations across different settings and obtains the smallest orientation error when the initial pose is less accurate a more challenging setting. Further it can complete an entire route through continual vehicle pose estimation with initial vehicle pose given only at the starting point",

    "abstract": "The 3D Human Pose Estimation (3D HPE) task uses 2D images or videos to predict human joint coordinates in 3D space. Despite recent advancements in deep learning-based methods they mostly ignore the capability of coupling accessible texts and naturally feasible knowledge of humans missing out on valuable implicit supervision to guide the 3D HPE task. Moreover previous efforts often study this task from the perspective of the whole human body neglecting fine-grained guidance hidden in different body parts. To this end we present a new Fine-Grained Prompt-Driven Denoiser based on a diffusion model for 3D HPE named FinePOSE. It consists of three core blocks enhancing the reverse process of the diffusion model: (1) Fine-grained Part-aware Prompt learning (FPP) block constructs fine-grained part-aware prompts via coupling accessible texts and naturally feasible knowledge of body parts with learnable prompts to model implicit guidance. (2) Fine-grained Prompt-pose Communication (FPC) block establishes fine-grained communications between learned part-aware prompts and poses to improve the denoising quality. (3) Prompt-driven Timestamp Stylization (PTS) block integrates learned prompt embedding and temporal information related to the noise level to enable adaptive adjustment at each denoising step. Extensive experiments on public single-human pose estimation datasets show that FinePOSE outperforms state-of-the-art methods. We further extend FinePOSE to multi-human pose estimation. Achieving 34.3mm average MPJPE on the EgoHumans dataset demonstrates the potential of FinePOSE to deal with complex multi-human scenarios.

    "abstract": "Data mixing methods play a crucial role in semi-supervised learning (SSL) but their application is unexplored in long-tailed semi-supervised learning (LTSSL). The primary reason is that the in-batch mixing manner fails to address class imbalance. Furthermore existing LTSSL methods mainly focus on re-balancing data quantity but ignore class-wise uncertainty which is also vital for class balance. For instance some classes with sufficient samples might still exhibit high uncertainty due to indistinguishable features. To this end this paper introduces the Balanced and Entropy-based Mix (BEM) a pioneering mixing approach to re-balance the class distribution of both data quantity and uncertainty. Specifically we first propose a class balanced mix bank to store data of each class for mixing. This bank samples data based on the estimated quantity distribution thus re-balancing data quantity. Then we present an entropy-based learning approach to re-balance class-wise uncertainty including entropy-based sampling strategy entropy-based selection module and entropy-based class balanced loss. Our BEM first leverages data mixing for improving LTSSL and it can also serve as a complement to the existing re-balancing methods. Experimental results show that BEM significantly enhances various LTSSL frameworks and achieves state-of-the-art performances across multiple benchmarks",

It encompasses understanding both the geometry and appearance to enable novel view synthesis parsing semantic labels and tracking moving objects.

In this paper we introduce a novel pipeline that utilizes 3D Gaussian Splatting for holistic urban scene understanding. Our main idea involves the joint optimization of geometry appearance semantics and motion using a combination of static and dynamic 3D Gaussians where moving object poses are regularized via physical constraints. Our approach offers the ability to render new viewpoints in real-time yielding 2D and 3D semantic information with high accuracy and reconstruct dynamic scenes even in scenarios where 3D bounding box detection are highly noisy.

    "abstract": "Recent progress in Vision-Language (VL) foundation models has revealed the great advantages of cross-modality learning. However due to a large gap between vision and text they might not be able to sufficiently utilize the benefits of cross-modality information. In the field of human action recognition the additional pose modality may bridge the gap between vision and text to improve the effectiveness of cross-modality learning. In this paper we propose a novel framework called the Pose-enhanced Vision-Language (PeVL) model to adapt the VL model with pose modality to learn effective knowledge of fine-grained human actions. Our PeVL model includes two novel components: an Unsymmetrical Cross-Modality Refinement (UCMR) block and a Semantic-Guided Multi-level Contrastive (SGMC) module. The UCMR block includes Pose-guided Visual Refinement (P2V-R) and Visual-enriched Pose Refinement (V2P-R) for effective cross-modality learning. The SGMC module includes Multi-level Contrastive Associations of vision-text and pose-text at both action and sub-action levels and a Semantic-Guided Loss enabling effective contrastive learning with text. Built upon a pre-trained VL foundation model our model integrates trainable adapters and can be trained end-to-end.

    "abstract": "Diffusion models have recently gained unprecedented attention in the field of image synthesis due to their remarkable generative capabilities. Notwithstanding their prowess these models often incur substantial computational costs primarily attributed to the sequential denoising process and cumbersome model size. Traditional methods for compressing diffusion models typically involve extensive retraining presenting cost and feasibility challenges. In this paper we introduce DeepCache a novel training-free paradigm that accelerates diffusion models from the perspective of model architecture. DeepCache capitalizes on the inherent temporal redundancy observed in the sequential denoising steps of diffusion models which caches and retrieves features across adjacent denoising stages thereby curtailing redundant computations. Utilizing the property of the U-Net we reuse the high-level features while updating the low-level features in a very cheap way. This innovative strategy in turn enables a speedup factor of 2.3xfor Stable Diffusion v1.5 with only a 0.05 decline in CLIP Score and 4.1xfor LDM-4-G with a slight decrease of 0.22 in FID on ImageNet. Our experiments also demonstrate DeepCache's superiority over existing pruning and distillation methods that necessitate retraining and its compatibility with current sampling techniques.

This early fusion of audio and visual cues demonstrated through cognitive psychology and neuroscience research offers promising potential for developing multimodal perception models.

In this paper we address this challenge by leveraging the masked reconstruction framework previously successful in unimodal settings to train audio-visual encoders with early fusion. Additionally we propose an attention-based fusion module that captures interactions between local audio and visual representations enhancing the model's ability to capture fine-grained interactions. While effective this procedure can become computationally intractable as the number of local representations increases. Thus to address the computational complexity we propose an alternative procedure that factorizes the local representations before representing audio-visual interactions.

In this work we investigate strengthening the awareness of video dynamics for DMs for high-quality T2V generation. Inspired by human intuition we design an innovative dynamic scene manager (dubbed as Dysen) module which includes (step-1) extracting from input text the key actions with proper time-order arrangement (step-2) transforming the action schedules into the dynamic scene graph (DSG) representations and (step-3) enriching the scenes in the DSG with sufficient and reasonable details. Taking advantage of the existing powerful LLMs (e.g. ChatGPT) via in-context learning Dysen realizes (nearly) human-level temporal dynamics understanding. Finally the resulting video DSG with rich action scene details is encoded as fine-grained spatio-temporal features integrated into the backbone T2V DM for video generating.

Personalized Text-to-Image Retrieval (TIR) or Generation (TIG) are recently introduced tasks that represent this challenge where the VL model has to learn a concept from few images and respectively discriminate or generate images of the target concept in arbitrary contexts. We identify the ability to learn new meanings and their compositionality with known ones as two key properties of a personalized system. We show that the available benchmarks offer a limited validation of personalized textual concept learning from images with respect to the above properties and introduce ConCon-Chi as a benchmark for both personalized TIR and TIG designed to fill this gap. We modelled the new-meaning concepts by crafting chimeric objects and formulating a large varied set of contexts where we photographed each object. To promote the compositionality assessment of the learned concepts with known contexts we combined different contexts with the same concept and vice-versa. We carry out a thorough evaluation of state-of-the-art methods on the resulting dataset. Our study suggests that future work on personalized TIR and TIG methods should focus on the above key properties and we propose principles and a dataset for their performance assessment.

Recent methods employ multiple-instance learning (MIL) techniques that tend to focus solely on the most discriminative segments resulting in frequent misclassifications. Our idea is to first construct several prototype features for each event class by clustering key segments identified for the event in the training data. We then assign pseudo labels to all training segments based on their feature similarities with these prototypes and re-train the model under weak and strong supervision. We facilitate this by structuring the feature space with contrastive learning using pseudo labels. Experiments show that we outperform existing methods for weakly-supervised AVVP.

We present DiffPose a self-supervised approach that leverages patient-specific simulation and differentiable physics-based rendering to achieve accurate 2D/3D registration without relying on manually labeled data. Preoperatively a CNN is trained to regress the pose of a randomly oriented synthetic X-ray rendered from the preoperative CT. The CNN then initializes rapid intraoperative test-time optimization that uses the differentiable X-ray renderer to refine the solution. Our work further proposes several geometrically principled methods for sampling camera poses from SE(3) for sparse differentiable rendering and for driving registration in the tangent space se(3) with geodesic and multiscale locality-sensitive losses. DiffPose achieves sub-millimeter accuracy across surgical datasets at intraoperative speeds improving upon existing unsupervised methods by an order of magnitude and even outperforming supervised baselines.

    "abstract": "Characters are an important aspect of any storyline and identifying and including them in descriptions is necessary for story understanding. While previous work has largely ignored identity and generated captions with someone (anonymized names) recent work formulates id-aware captioning as a fill-in-the-blanks (FITB) task where given a caption with blanks the goal is to predict person id labels. However to predict captions with ids a two-stage approach is required: first predict captions with someone then fill in identities. In this work we present a new single stage approach that can seamlessly switch between id-aware caption generation or FITB when given a caption with blanks. Our model Movie-Identity Captioner (MICap) uses a shared auto-regressive decoder that benefits from training with FITB and full-caption generation objectives while the encoder can benefit from or disregard captions with blanks as input. Another challenge with id-aware captioning is the lack of a metric to capture subtle differences between person ids. To this end we introduce iSPICE a caption evaluation metric that focuses on identity tuples created through intermediate scene graphs. We evaluate MICap on Large-Scale Movie Description Challenge (LSMDC) where we show a 4.2% improvement in FITB accuracy and a 1-2% bump in classic captioning metrics",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "3D object detection and pose estimation from a single-view image is challenging due to the high uncertainty caused by the absence of 3D perception. As a solution recent monocular 3D detection methods leverage additional modalities such as stereo image pairs and LiDAR point clouds to enhance image features at the expense of additional annotation costs. We propose using diffusion models to learn effective representations for monocular 3D detection without additional modalities or training data. We present MonoDiff a novel framework that employs the reverse diffusion process to estimate 3D bounding box and orientation. But considering the variability in bounding box sizes along different dimensions it is ineffective to sample noise from a standard Gaussian distribution. Hence we adopt a Gaussian mixture model to sample noise during the forward diffusion process and initialize the reverse diffusion process. Furthermore since the diffusion model generates the 3D parameters for a given object image we leverage 2D detection information to provide additional supervision by maintaining the correspondence between 3D/2D projection. Finally depending on the signal-to-noise ratio we incorporate a dynamic weighting scheme to account for the level of uncertainty in the supervision by projection at different timesteps. MonoDiff outperforms current state-of-the-art monocular 3D detection methods on the KITTI and Waymo benchmarks without additional depth priors.

With these pairs each client can transfer pre-existing knowledge from the generator to its local model through an additional supervised local task. We conduct extensive experiments on four datasets under two types of data heterogeneity with 14 kinds of models including CNNs and ViTs.

Inspired by recent advances in powerful large language models we adopt a sequence-based approach to autoregressively generate triangle meshes as sequences of triangles. We first learn a vocabulary of latent quantized embeddings using graph convolutions which inform these embeddings of the local mesh geometry and topology. These embeddings are sequenced and decoded into triangles by a decoder ensuring that they can effectively reconstruct the mesh. A transformer is then trained on this learned vocabulary to predict the index of the next embedding given previous embeddings. Once trained our model can be autoregressively sampled to generate new triangle meshes directly generating compact meshes with sharp edges more closely imitating the efficient triangulation patterns of human-crafted meshes. MeshGPT demonstrates a notable improvement over state of the art mesh generation methods with a 9% increase in shape coverage and a 30-point enhancement in FID scores across various categories",

Existing methods broadly obey coordinate-based scheme where inlier confidence is scored through simply capturing coordinate differences in the context. However this scheme results in massive inlier misinterpretation readily consequently affecting the registration performance. In this paper we explore to extend a new definition called inlier confidence calibration (ICC) to alleviate the above issues. Firstly we provide finely initial correspondences for ICC in order to generate high quality reference point cloud copy corresponding to the source point cloud. In particular we develop a soft assignment matrix optimization theorem that offers faster speed and greater precision compared to Sinkhorn. Benefiting from the high quality reference copy we argue the neighborhood patch formed by inlier and its neighborhood should have consistency between source point cloud and its reference copy. Based on this insight we construct transformation-invariant geometric constraints and capture geometric structure consistency to calibrate inlier confidence for estimated correspondences between source point cloud and its reference copy. Finally transformation is further calculated by the weighted SVD algorithm with the calibrated inlier confidence. Our model is trained in an unsupervised manner and extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Training deep neural networks has become a common approach for addressing image restoration problems. An alternative for training a \"task-specific\" network for each observation model is to use pretrained deep denoisers for imposing only the signal's prior within iterative algorithms without additional training. Recently a sampling-based variant of this approach has become popular with the rise of diffusion/score-based generative models. Using denoisers for general purpose restoration requires guiding the iterations to ensure agreement of the signal with the observations. In low-noise settings guidance that is based on back-projection (BP) has been shown to be a promising strategy (used recently also under the names \"pseudoinverse\" or \"range/-space\" guidance). However the presence of noise in the observations hinders the gains from this approach. In this paper we propose a novel guidance technique based on preconditioning that allows traversing from BP-based guidance to least squares based guidance along the restoration scheme. The proposed approach is robust to noise while still having much simpler implementation than alternative methods (e.g. it does not require SVD or a large number of iterations). We use it within both an optimization scheme and a sampling-based scheme and demonstrate its advantages over existing methods for image deblurring and super-resolution",

While effective for logical tasks CoT is not conducive to creative problem-solving which often requires out-of-box thoughts and is crucial for innovation advancements. In this paper we explore the Leap-of-Thought (LoT) abilities within LLMs -- a non-sequential creative paradigm involving strong associations and knowledge leaps. To this end we study LLMs on the popular Oogiri game which needs participants to have good creativity and strong associative thinking for responding unexpectedly and humorously to the given image text or both and thus is suitable for LoT study. Then to investigate LLMs' LoT ability in the Oogiri game we first build a multimodal and multilingual Oogiri-GO dataset which contains over 130000 samples from the Oogiri game and observe the insufficient LoT ability or failures of most existing LLMs on the Oogiri game. Accordingly we introduce a creative Leap-of-Thought (CLoT) paradigm to improve LLM's LoT ability. CLoT first formulates the Oogiri-GO dataset into LoT-oriented instruction tuning data to train pretrained LLM for achieving certain LoT humor generation and discrimination abilities. Then CLoT designs an explorative self-refinement that encourages the LLM to generate more creative LoT data via exploring parallels between seemingly unrelated concepts and selects high-quality data to train itself for self-refinement. CLoT not only excels in humor generation in the Oogiri game as shown in Fig. 1 but also boosts creative abilities in various tasks like \"cloud guessing game\" and \"divergent association task\". These findings advance our understanding and offer a pathway to improve LLMs' creative capacities for innovative applications across domains.

This task has practical applications in various fields such as visual surveillance crowd behavior analysis and anomaly detection. However due to the difficulty and cost of collecting and labeling data existing datasets for this task are either synthetically generated or artificially constructed within a controlled camera network setting which limits their ability to model real-world dynamics and generalize to diverse camera configurations. To address this issue we present MTMMC a real-world large-scale dataset that includes long video sequences captured by 16 multi-modal cameras in two different environments - campus and factory - across various time weather and season conditions. This dataset provides a challenging test bed for studying multi-camera tracking under diverse real-world complexities and includes an additional input modality of spatially aligned and temporally synchronized RGB and thermal cameras which enhances the accuracy of multi-camera tracking. MTMMC is a super-set of existing datasets benefiting independent fields such as person detection re-identification and multiple object tracking. We provide baselines and new learning setups on this dataset and set the reference scores for future studies. The datasets models and test server will be made publicly available",

    "abstract": "Extending large image-text pre-trained models (e.g. CLIP) for video understanding has made significant advancements. To enable the capability of CLIP to perceive dynamic information in videos existing works are dedicated to equipping the visual encoder with various temporal modules. However these methods exhibit \"asymmetry\" between the visual and textual sides with neither temporal descriptions in input texts nor temporal modules in text encoder. This limitation hinders the potential of language supervision emphasized in CLIP and restricts the learning of temporal features as the text encoder has demonstrated limited proficiency in motion understanding. To address this issue we propose leveraging \"MoTion-Enhanced Descriptions\" (MoTED) to facilitate the extraction of distinctive temporal features in videos. Specifically we first generate discriminative motion-related descriptions via querying GPT-4 to compare easy-confusing action categories. Then we incorporate both the visual and textual encoders with additional perception modules to process the video frames and generated descriptions respectively. Finally we adopt a contrastive loss to align the visual and textual motion features. Extensive experiments on five benchmarks show that MoTED surpasses state-of-the-art methods with convincing gaps laying a solid foundation for empowering CLIP with strong temporal modeling",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Patch-based adversarial attacks were proven to compromise the robustness and reliability of computer vision systems. However their conspicuous and easily detectable nature challenge their practicality in real-world setting. To address this recent work has proposed using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to generate naturalistic patches that may not attract human attention. However such approaches suffer from a limited latent space making it challenging to produce a patch that is efficient stealthy and robust to multiple real-world transformations. This paper introduces a novel approach that produces a Dynamic Adversarial Patch (DAP) designed to overcome these limitations. DAP maintains a naturalistic appearance while optimizing attack efficiency and robustness to real-world transformations. The approach involves redefining the optimization problem and introducing a novel objective function that incorporates a similarity metric to guide the patch's creation. Unlike GAN-based techniques the DAP directly modifies pixel values within the patch providing increased flexibility and adaptability to multiple transformations. Furthermore most clothing-based physical attacks assume static objects and ignore the possible transformations caused by non-rigid deformation due to changes in a person's pose. To address this limitation a `Creases Transformation' (CT) block is introduced enhancing the patch's resilience to a variety of real-world distortions. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms state-of-the-art attacks achieving a success rate of up to 82.28% in the digital world when targeting the YOLOv7 detector and 65% in the physical world when targeting YOLOv3tiny detector deployed in edge-based smart cameras",

However in current methods the image splitting makes the information of latent variables being uniformly distributed in each subimage and causes inadequate use of latent variables in addition to posterior collapse. To tackle these issues we introduce Bit Plane Slicing (BPS) splitting images in the bit plane dimension with the considerations on different importance for latent variables. Thus BPS provides a more effective representation by arranging subimages with decreasing importance for latent variables. To solve the problem of the increased number of dimensions caused by BPS we further propose a dimension-tailored autoregressive model that tailors autoregression methods for each dimension based on their characteristics efficiently capturing the dependencies in plane space and color dimensions. As shown in the extensive experimental results our method demonstrates the superior compression performance with comparable inference speed when compared to the state-of-the-art normalizing-flow-based methods.

However current prevailing facial texture generation methods generally suffer from low-quality texture identity information loss and inadequate handling of occlusions. To solve these problems we introduce an Identity-Conditioned Latent Diffusion Model for face UV-texture generation (UV-IDM) to generate photo-realistic textures based on the Basel Face Model (BFM). UV-IDM leverages the powerful texture generation capacity of a latent diffusion model (LDM) to obtain detailed facial textures. To preserve the identity during the reconstruction procedure we design an identity-conditioned module that can utilize any in-the-wild image as a robust condition for the LDM to guide texture generation. UV-IDM can be easily adapted to different BFM-based methods as a high-fidelity texture generator. Furthermore in light of the limited accessibility of most existing UV-texture datasets we build a large-scale and publicly available UV-texture dataset based on BFM termed BFM-UV. Extensive experiments show that our UV-IDM can generate high-fidelity textures in 3D face reconstruction within seconds while maintaining image consistency bringing new state-of-the-art performance in facial texture generation",

    "abstract": "Current diffusion or flow-based generative models for 3D shapes divide to two: distilling pre-trained 2D image diffusion models and training directly on 3D shapes. When training a diffusion or flow models on 3D shapes a crucial design choice is the shape representation. An effective shape representation needs to adhere three design principles: it should allow an efficient conversion of large 3D datasets to the representation form; it should provide a good tradeoff of approximation power versus number of parameters; and it should have a simple tensorial form that is compatible with existing powerful neural architectures. While standard 3D shape representations such as volumetric grids and point clouds do not adhere to all these principles simultaneously we advocate in this paper a new representation that does. We introduce Mosaic-SDF (M-SDF): a simple 3D shape representation that approximates the Signed Distance Function (SDF) of a given shape by using a set of local grids spread near the shape's boundary. The M-SDF representation is fast to compute for each shape individually making it readily parallelizable; it is parameter efficient as it only covers the space around the shape's boundary; and it has a simple matrix form compatible with Transformer-based architectures. We demonstrate the efficacy of the M-SDF representation by using it to train a 3D generative flow model including class-conditioned generation with the ShapeNetCore-V2 (3D Warehouse) dataset and text-to-3D generation using a dataset of about 600k caption-shape pairs",

    "abstract": "Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) has been instrumental in improving deep neural network training by minimizing both training loss and loss sharpness. Despite the practical success the mechanisms behind SAM's generalization enhancements remain elusive limiting its progress in deep learning optimization. In this work we investigate SAM's core components for generalization improvement and introduce \"Friendly-SAM\" (F-SAM) to further enhance SAM's generalization. Our investigation reveals the key role of batch-specific stochastic gradient noise within the adversarial perturbation i.e. the current minibatch gradient which significantly influences SAM's generalization performance. By decomposing the adversarial perturbation in SAM into full gradient and stochastic gradient noise components we discover that relying solely on the full gradient component degrades generalization while excluding it leads to improved performance. The possible reason lies in the full gradient component's increase in sharpness loss for the entire dataset creating inconsistencies with the subsequent sharpness minimization step solely on the current minibatch data. Inspired by these insights F-SAM aims to mitigate the negative effects of the full gradient component. It removes the full gradient estimated by an exponentially moving average (EMA) of historical stochastic gradients and then leverages stochastic gradient noise for improved generalization. Moreover we provide theoretical validation for the EMA approximation and prove the convergence of F-SAM on non-convex problems. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior generalization performance and robustness of F-SAM over vanilla SAM. Code is available at https://github.com/nblt/F-SAM",

Now text-to-image foundation models are widely applied to various downstream image synthesis tasks such as controllable image generation and image editing while downstream video synthesis tasks are less explored for several reasons. First it requires huge memory and computation overhead to train a video generation foundation model. Even with video foundation models additional costly training is still required for downstream video synthesis tasks. Second although some works extend image diffusion models into videos in a training-free manner temporal consistency cannot be well preserved. Finally these adaption methods are specifically designed for one task and fail to generalize to different tasks. To mitigate these issues we propose a training-free general-purpose video synthesis framework coined as BIVDiff via bridging specific image diffusion models and general text-to-video foundation diffusion models. Specifically we first use a specific image diffusion model (e.g. ControlNet and Instruct Pix2Pix) for frame-wise video generation then perform Mixed Inversion on the generated video and finally input the inverted latents into the video diffusion models (e.g. VidRD and ZeroScope) for temporal smoothing. This decoupled framework enables flexible image model selection for different purposes with strong task generalization and high efficiency. To validate the effectiveness and general use of BIVDiff we perform a wide range of video synthesis tasks including controllable video generation video editing video inpainting and outpainting",

Most methods that solely depend on coarse-grained object cues such as boxes and the overall appearance of the object are susceptible to degradation due to distorted internal relationships of dynamic objects. To address this problem this work proposes NetTrack an efficient generic and affordable tracking framework to introduce fine-grained learning that is robust to dynamicity. Specifically NetTrack constructs a dynamicity-aware association with a fine-grained Net leveraging point-level visual cues. Correspondingly a fine-grained sampler and matching method have been incorporated. Furthermore NetTrack learns object-text correspondence for fine-grained localization. To evaluate MOT in extremely dynamic open-world scenarios a bird flock tracking (BFT) dataset is constructed which exhibits high dynamicity with diverse species and open-world scenarios. Comprehensive evaluation on BFT validates the effectiveness of fine-grained learning on object dynamicity and thorough transfer experiments on challenging open-world benchmarks i.e. TAO TAO-OW AnimalTrack and GMOT-40 validate the strong generalization ability of NetTrack even without finetuning",

    "abstract": "Predicting the trajectories of road agents is essential for autonomous driving systems. The recent mainstream methods follow a static paradigm which predicts the future trajectory by using a fixed duration of historical frames. These methods make the predictions independently even at adjacent time steps which leads to potential instability and temporal inconsistency. As successive time steps have largely overlapping historical frames their forecasting should have intrinsic correlation such as overlapping predicted trajectories should be consistent or be different but share the same motion goal depending on the road situation. Motivated by this in this work we introduce HPNet a novel dynamic trajectory forecasting method. Aiming for stable and accurate trajectory forecasting our method leverages not only historical frames including maps and agent states but also historical predictions. Specifically we newly design a Historical Prediction Attention module to automatically encode the dynamic relationship between successive predictions. Besides it also extends the attention range beyond the currently visible window benefitting from the use of historical predictions. The proposed Historical Prediction Attention together with the Agent Attention and Mode Attention is further formulated as the Triple Factorized Attention module serving as the core design of HPNet.

These sparser regimes present new challenges as a 4-line LiDAR increases the distance between pixels without depth and their nearest depth point sixfold from 5 pixels to 30 pixels compared to 64 lines. Observing that existing methods struggle with sparse and variable distribution depth maps we propose an Affinity-Based Shift Correction (ASC) module that iteratively aligns depth predictions to input depth based on predicted affinities between image pixels and depth points. Our framework enables each depth point to adaptively influence and improve predictions across the image leading to largely improved results for fewer-line fewer-point and variable sparsity settings. Further we show improved performance in domain transfer from KITTI to nuScenes and from random sampling to irregular point distributions.

In this line of research existing methods typically follow an inversion-and-distillation paradigm in which a generative adversarial network on-the-fly trained with the guidance of the pre-trained teacher network is used to synthesize a large-scale sample set for knowledge distillation. In this paper we reexamine this common data-free knowledge distillation paradigm showing that there is considerable room to improve the overall training efficiency through a lens of \"small-scale inverted data for knowledge distillation\". In light of three empirical observations indicating the importance of how to balance class distributions in terms of synthetic sample diversity and difficulty during both data inversion and distillation processes we propose Small Scale Data-free Knowledge Distillation (SSD-KD). In formulation SSD-KD introduces a modulating function to balance synthetic samples and a priority sampling function to select proper samples facilitated by a dynamic replay buffer and a reinforcement learning strategy. As a result SSD-KD can perform distillation training conditioned on an extremely small scale of synthetic samples (e.g. 10x less than the original training data scale) making the overall training efficiency one or two orders of magnitude faster than many mainstream methods while retaining superior or competitive model performance as demonstrated on popular image classification and semantic segmentation benchmarks.

We build a set of collections of generated images prequalified to fool simple signal-based classifiers into believing they are real. We then show that prequalified generated images can be identified reliably by classifiers that only look at geometric properties. We use three such classifiers. All three classifiers are denied access to image pixels and look only at derived geometric features. The first classifier looks at the perspective field of the image the second looks at lines detected in the image and the third looks at relations between detected objects and shadows. Our procedure detects generated images more reliably than SOTA local signal based detectors for images from a number of distinct generators. Saliency maps suggest that the classifiers can identify geometric problems reliably. We conclude that current generators cannot reliably reproduce geometric properties of real images",

    "abstract": "Domain generalization (DG) based Face Anti-Spoofing (FAS) aims to improve the model's performance on unseen domains. Existing methods either rely on domain labels to align domain-invariant feature spaces or disentangle generalizable features from the whole sample which inevitably lead to the distortion of semantic feature structures and achieve limited generalization. In this work we make use of large-scale VLMs like CLIP and leverage the textual feature to dynamically adjust the classifier's weights for exploring generalizable visual features. Specifically we propose a novel Class Free Prompt Learning (CFPL) paradigm for DG FAS which utilizes two lightweight transformers namely Content Q-Former (CQF) and Style Q-Former (SQF) to learn the different semantic prompts conditioned on content and style features by using a set of learnable query vectors respectively. Thus the generalizable prompt can be learned by two improvements: (1) A Prompt-Text Matched (PTM) supervision is introduced to ensure CQF learns visual representation that is most informative of the content description. (2) A Diversified Style Prompt (DSP) technology is proposed to diversify the learning of style prompts by mixing feature statistics between instance-specific styles. Finally the learned text features modulate visual features to generalization through the designed Prompt Modulation (PM). Extensive experiments show that the CFPL is effective and outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on several cross-domain datasets",

Traditionally MIL interpretability is limited to identifying salient regions deemed pertinent for downstream tasks offering little insight to the end-user (pathologist) regarding the rationale behind these selections. To address this we propose Self-Interpretable MIL (SI-MIL) a method intrinsically designed for interpretability from the very outset. SI-MIL employs a deep MIL framework to guide an interpretable branch grounded on handcrafted pathological features facilitating linear predictions. Beyond identifying salient regions SI-MIL uniquely provides feature-level interpretations rooted in pathological insights for WSIs. Notably SI-MIL with its linear prediction constraints challenges the prevalent myth of an inevitable trade-off between model interpretability and performance demonstrating competitive results compared to state-of-the-art methods on WSI-level prediction tasks across three cancer types.

Prior work has illustrated the effectiveness of employing occupancy-based or distance-based virtual sensors to extract hand-object interaction features. Nonetheless these methods show limited generalizability across object categories shapes and sizes. We hypothesize that this is due to two reasons: 1) the limited expressiveness of employed virtual sensors and 2) scarcity of available training data. To tackle this challenge we introduce a novel joint-centered sensor designed to reason about local object geometry near potential interaction regions. The sensor queries for object surface points in the neighbourhood of each hand joint. As an important step towards mitigating the learning complexity we transform the points from global frame to hand template frame and use a shared module to process sensor features of each individual joint. This is followed by a spatio-temporal transformer network aimed at capturing correlation among the joints in different dimensions. Moreover we devise simple heuristic rules to augment the limited training sequences with vast static hand grasping samples. This leads to a broader spectrum of grasping types observed during training in turn enhancing our model's generalization capability. We evaluate on two public datasets GRAB and InterCap where our method shows superiority over baselines both quantitatively and perceptually",

To obtain generalization to a large set of sketches and categories we build on a vision transformer encoder pretrained with the CLIP model. We freeze the text encoder and perform visual-prompt tuning of the visual encoder branch while introducing a set of critical modifications. Firstly we augment the classical key-query (k-q) self-attention blocks with value-value (v-v) self-attention blocks. Central to our model is a two-level hierarchical network design that enables efficient semantic disentanglement: The first level ensures holistic scene sketch encoding and the second level focuses on individual categories. We then in the second level of the hierarchy introduce a cross-attention between textual and visual branches. Our method outperforms zero-shot CLIP pixel accuracy of segmentation results by 37 points reaching an accuracy of 85.5% on the FS-COCO sketch dataset.

Recent advancements in human-based neural rendering have enabled high-quality geometry and appearance reconstruction of clothed humans from just monocular videos. However these methods bake intrinsic properties such as albedo material and environment lighting into a single entangled neural representation. On the other hand only a handful of works tackle the problem of estimating geometry and disentangled appearance properties of clothed humans from monocular videos. They usually achieve limited quality and disentanglement due to approximations of secondary shading effects via learned MLPs. In this work we propose to model secondary shading effects explicitly via Monte-Carlo ray tracing. We model the rendering process of clothed humans as a volumetric scattering process and combine ray tracing with body articulation. Our approach can recover high-quality geometry albedo material and lighting properties of clothed humans from a single monocular video without requiring supervised pre-training using ground truth materials. Furthermore since we explicitly model the volumetric scattering process and ray tracing our model naturally generalizes to novel poses enabling animation of the reconstructed avatar in novel lighting conditions",

Due to the limited research in structured attacks imposing consistency checks on natural multi-object scenes is a practical defense against conventional adversarial attacks.

Therefore we present the first approach GLOW that copes with various attack requests by generating global layout-aware adversarial attacks in which both categorical and geometric layout constraints are explicitly established. Specifically we focus on object detection tasks and given a victim image GLOW first localizes victim objects according to target labels. And then it generates multiple attack plans together with their context-consistency scores. GLOW on the one hand is capable of handling various types of requests including single or multiple victim objects with or without specified victim objects. On the other hand it produces a consistency score for each attack plan reflecting the overall contextual consistency that both semantic category and global scene layout are considered. We conduct our experiments on MS COCO and Pascal. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that we can achieve about 30% average relative improvement compared to state-of-the-art methods in conventional single object attack request; Moreover such superiority is also valid across more generic attack requests under both white-box and zero-query black-box settings.

In this paper we propose DynaCor framework that distinguishes incorrectly labeled instances from correctly labeled ones based on the dynamics of the training signals.

We develop a palette of stylized 3D strokes from basic primitives and splines and consider the 3D scene stylization task as a multi-view reconstruction process based on these 3D stroke primitives. Instead of directly searching for the parameters of these 3D strokes which would be too costly we introduce a differentiable renderer that allows optimizing stroke parameters using gradient descent and propose a training scheme to alleviate the vanishing gradient issue. The extensive evaluation demonstrates that our approach effectively synthesizes 3D scenes with significant geometric and aesthetic stylization while maintaining a consistent appearance across different views.

Existing cutting-edge 3D-aware reenactment methods often use neural radiance fields or 3D meshes to produce view-consistent appearance encoding but at the same time they rely on linear face models such as 3DMM to achieve its disentanglement with facial expressions. As a result their reenactment results often exhibit identity leakage from the driver or have unnatural expressions. To address these problems we propose a neural self-supervised disentanglement approach that lifts both the source image and driver video frame into a shared 3D volumetric representation based on tri-planes. This representation can then be freely manipulated with expression tri-planes extracted from the driving images and rendered from an arbitrary view using neural radiance fields. We achieve this disentanglement via self-supervised learning on a large in-the-wild video dataset. We further introduce a highly effective fine-tuning approach to improve the generalizability of the 3D lifting using the same real-world data. We demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on a wide range of datasets and also showcase high-quality 3D-aware head reenactment on highly challenging and diverse subjects including non-frontal head poses and complex expressions for both source and driver",

    "abstract": "Existing automatic captioning methods for visual content face challenges such as lack of detail content hallucination and poor instruction following. In this work we propose VisualFactChecker (VFC) a flexible training-free pipeline that generates high-fidelity and detailed captions for both 2D images and 3D objects. VFC consists of three steps: 1) proposal where image-to-text captioning models propose multiple initial captions; 2) verification where a large language model (LLM) utilizes tools such as object detection and VQA models to fact-check proposed captions; 3) captioning where an LLM generates the final caption by summarizing caption proposals and the fact check verification results. In this step VFC can flexibly generate captions in various styles following complex instructions. We conduct comprehensive captioning evaluations using four metrics: 1) CLIP-Score for image-text similarity; 2) CLIP-Image-Score for measuring the image-image similarity between the original and the reconstructed image generated by a text-to-image model using the caption. 3) human study on Amazon Mechanical Turk; 4) GPT-4V for fine-grained evaluation. Evaluation results show that VFC outperforms state-of-the-art open-sourced captioning methods for 2D images on the COCO dataset and 3D assets on the Objaverse dataset. Our study demonstrates that by combining open-source models into a pipeline we can attain captioning capability comparable to proprietary models such as GPT-4V despite being over 10x smaller in model size",

    "abstract": "Collaborative perception empowers each agent to improve its perceptual ability through the exchange of perceptual messages with other agents. It inherently results in a fundamental trade-off between perception ability and communication cost. To address this bottleneck issue our core idea is to optimize the collaborative messages from two key aspects: representation and selection. The proposed codebook-based message representation enables the transmission of integer codes rather than high-dimensional feature maps. The proposed information-filling-driven message selection optimizes local messages to collectively fill each agent's information demand preventing information overflow among multiple agents. By integrating these two designs we propose CodeFilling a novel communication-efficient collaborative perception system which significantly advances the perception-communication trade-off and is inclusive to both homogeneous and heterogeneous collaboration settings. We evaluate CodeFilling in both a real-world dataset DAIR-V2X and a new simulation dataset OPV2VH+. Results show that CodeFilling outperforms previous SOTA Where2comm on DAIR-V2X/OPV2VH+ with 1333/1206x lower communication volume. Our code is available at https://github.com/PhyllisH/CodeFilling",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for learning from decentralized data and federated domain generalization further considers the test dataset (target domain) is absent from the decentralized training data (source domains). However most existing FL methods assume that domain labels are provided during training and their evaluation imposes explicit constraints on the number of domains which must strictly match the number of clients. Because of the underutilization of numerous edge devices and additional cross-client domain annotations in the real world such restrictions may be impractical and involve potential privacy leaks. In this paper we propose an efficient and novel approach called Disentangled Prompt Tuning (DiPrompT) a method that tackles the above restrictions by learning adaptive prompts for domain generalization in a distributed manner. Specifically we first design two types of prompts i.e. global prompt to capture general knowledge across all clients and domain prompts to capture domain-specific knowledge. They eliminate the restriction on the one-to-one mapping between source domains and local clients. Furthermore a dynamic query metric is introduced to automatically search the suitable domain label for each sample which includes two-substep text-image alignments based on prompt tuning without labor-intensive annotation. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate that our DiPrompT achieves superior domain generalization performance over state-of-the-art FL methods when domain labels are not provided and even outperforms many centralized learning methods using domain labels",

We instead cast the task of 3D inference as directly generating mutually-consistent multiple views and build on the insight that additionally inferring depth can provide a mechanism for enforcing this consistency. Specifically we train a denoising diffusion model to generate multi-view RGB-D images given a single RGB input image and leverage the (intermediate noisy) depth estimates to obtain reprojection-based conditioning to maintain multi-view consistency. We train our model using large-scale synthetic dataset Obajverse as well as the real-world CO3D dataset comprising of generic camera viewpoints. We demonstrate that our approach can yield more accurate synthesis compared to recent state-of-the-art including distillation-based 3D inference and prior multi-view generation methods. We also evaluate the geometry induced by our multi-view depth prediction and find that it yields a more accurate representation than other direct 3D inference approaches",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Image-based mirror detection has recently undergone rapid research due to its significance in applications such as robotic navigation semantic segmentation and scene reconstruction. Recently VMD-Net was proposed as the first video mirror detection technique by modeling dual correspondences between the inside and outside of the mirror both spatially and temporally. However this approach is not reliable as correspondences can occur completely inside or outside of the mirrors. In addition the proposed dataset VMD-D contains many small mirrors limiting its applicability to real-world scenarios. To address these problems we developed a more challenging dataset that includes mirrors of various shapes and sizes at different locations of the frames providing a better reflection of real-world scenarios. Next we observed that the motions between the inside and outside of the mirror are often inconsistent. For instance when moving in front of a mirror the motion inside the mirror is often much smaller than the motion outside due to increased depth perception. With these observations we propose modeling inconsistent motion cues to detect mirrors and a new network with two novel modules. The Motion Attention Module (MAM) explicitly models inconsistent motions around mirrors via optical flow and the Motion-Guided Edge Detection Module (MEDM) uses motions to guide mirror edge feature learning. Experimental results on our proposed dataset show that our method outperforms state-of-the-arts. The code and dataset are available at https://github.com/AlexAnthonyWarren/MG-VMD",

Recently multi-object tracking in various practical use cases have received much attention but multi-object tracking in dark scenes is rarely considered. In this paper we focus on multi-object tracking in dark scenes. To address the lack of datasets we first build a Low-light Multi-Object Tracking (LMOT) dataset. LMOT provides well-aligned low-light video pairs captured by our dual-camera system and high-quality multi-object tracking annotations for all videos. Then we propose a low-light multi-object tracking method termed as LTrack. We introduce the adaptive low-pass downsample module to enhance low-frequency components of images outside the sensor noises. The degradation suppression learning strategy enables the model to learn invariant information under noise disturbance and image quality degradation. These components improve the robustness of multi-object tracking in dark scenes. We conducted a comprehensive analysis of our LMOT dataset and proposed LTrack. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method and its competitiveness in real night low-light scenes. Dataset and Code: https://github.com/ying-fu/LMOT",

In this paper we delve into the impacts of data transformations on the speed of neural field training specifically focusing on how permuting pixel locations affect the convergence speed of SGD. Counterintuitively we find that randomly permuting the pixel locations can considerably accelerate the training. To explain this phenomenon we examine the neural field training through the lens of PSNR curves loss landscapes and error patterns.

However compared to the top-performing methods reliant on 3D-3D correspondence matching APR's accuracy still has room for improvement. We recognize APR's lack of robust features learning and iterative denoising process leads to suboptimal results. In this paper we propose DiffLoc a novel framework that formulates LiDAR localization as a conditional generation of poses. First we propose to utilize the foundation model and static-object-aware pool to learn robust features. Second we incorporate the iterative denoising process into APR via a diffusion model conditioned on the learned geometrically robust features. In addition due to the unique nature of diffusion models we propose to adapt our models to two additional applications: (1) using multiple inferences to evaluate pose uncertainty and (2) seamlessly introducing geometric constraints on denoising steps to improve prediction accuracy. Extensive experiments conducted on the Oxford Radar RobotCar and NCLT datasets demonstrate that DiffLoc outperforms better than the stateof-the-art methods.

    "abstract": "Previous advances in vehicle re-identification (ReID) are mostly reported under favorable lighting conditions while cross-day-and-night performance is neglected which greatly hinders the development of related traffic intelligence applications. This work instead develops a novel Day-Night Dual-domain Modulation (DNDM) vehicle re-identification framework for day-night cross-domain traffic scenarios. Specifically a unique night-domain glare suppression module is provided to attenuate the headlight glare from raw nighttime vehicle images. To enhance vehicle features under low-light environments we propose a dual-domain structure enhancement module in the feature extractor which enhances geometric structures between appearance features. To alleviate day-night domain discrepancies we develop a cross-domain class awareness module that facilitates the interaction between appearance and structure features in both domains. In this work we address the Day-Night cross-domain ReID (DN-ReID) problem and provide a new cross-domain dataset named DN-Wild including day and night images of 2286 identities giving in total 85945 daytime images and 54952 nighttime images. Furthermore we also take into account the matter of balance between day and night samples and provide a dataset called DN-348. Exhaustive experiments demonstrate the robustness of the proposed framework in the DN-ReID problem. The code and benchmark are released at https://github.com/chenjingong/DN-ReID",

    "abstract": "Recent breakthroughs in text-to-4D generation rely on pre-trained text-to-image and text-to-video models to generate dynamic 3D scenes. However current text-to-4D methods face a three-way tradeoff between the quality of scene appearance 3D structure and motion. For example text-to-image models and their 3D-aware variants are trained on internet-scale image datasets and can be used to produce scenes with realistic appearance and 3D structure---but no motion. Text-to-video models are trained on relatively smaller video datasets and can produce scenes with motion but poorer appearance and 3D structure. While these models have complementary strengths they also have opposing weaknesses making it difficult to combine them in a way that alleviates this three-way tradeoff. Here we introduce hybrid score distillation sampling an alternating optimization procedure that blends supervision signals from multiple pre-trained diffusion models and incorporates benefits of each for high-fidelity text-to-4D generation.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Adversarial distillation (AD) is a highly effective method for enhancing the robustness of small models. Contrary to expectations a high-performing teacher model does not always result in a more robust student model. This is due to two main reasons. First when there are significant differences in predictions between the teacher model and the student model exact matching of predicted values using KL divergence interferes with training leading to poor performance of existing methods. Second matching solely based on the output prevents the student model from fully understanding the behavior of the teacher model. To address these challenges this paper proposes a novel AD method named SmaraAD. During the training process we facilitate the student model in better understanding the teacher model's behavior by aligning the attribution region that the student model focuses on with that of the teacher model. Concurrently we relax the condition of exact matching in KL divergence and replace it with a more flexible matching criterion thereby enhancing the model's robustness. Extensive experiments substantiate the effectiveness of our method in improving the robustness of small models outperforming previous SOTA methods",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "As a bio-inspired vision sensor with ultra-high speed spike cameras exhibit great potential in recording dynamic scenes with high-speed motion or drastic light changes. Different from traditional cameras each pixel in spike cameras records the arrival of photons continuously by firing binary spikes at an ultra-fine temporal granularity. In this process multiple factors impact the imaging including the photons' Poisson arrival thermal noises from circuits and quantization effects in spike readout. These factors introduce fluctuations to spikes making the recorded spike intervals unstable and unable to reflect accurate light intensities. In this paper we present an approach to deal with spike fluctuations and boost spike camera image reconstruction. We first analyze the quantization effects and reveal the unbiased estimation attribute of the reciprocal of differential of spike firing time (DSFT). Based on this we propose a spike representation module to use DSFT with multiple orders for fluctuation suppression where DSFT with higher orders indicates spike integration duration between multiple spikes. We also propose a module for inter-moment feature alignment at multiple granularities. The coarser alignment is based on patch-level cross-attention with a local search strategy and the finer alignment is based on deformable convolution at the pixel level.

To tackle this here we present the Video Motion Customization (VMC) framework a novel one-shot tuning approach crafted to adapt temporal attention layers within video diffusion models. Our approach introduces a novel motion distillation objective using residual vectors between consecutive noisy latent frames as a motion reference. The diffusion process then preserve low-frequency motion trajectories while mitigating high-frequency motion-unrelated noise in image space.

To mitigate this limitation we present Holodeck a system that generates 3D environments to match a user-supplied prompt fully automatedly. Holodeck can generate diverse scenes e.g. arcades spas and museums adjust the designs for styles and can capture the semantics of complex queries such as \"apartment for a researcher with a cat\" and \"office of a professor who is a fan of Star Wars\". Holodeck leverages a large language model (i.e. GPT-4) for common sense knowledge about what the scene might look like and uses a large collection of 3D assets from Objaverse to populate the scene with diverse objects. To address the challenge of positioning objects correctly we prompt GPT-4 to generate spatial relational constraints between objects and then optimize the layout to satisfy those constraints. Our large-scale human evaluation shows that annotators prefer Holodeck over manually designed procedural baselines in residential scenes and that Holodeck can produce high-quality outputs for diverse scene types. We also demonstrate an exciting application of Holodeck in Embodied AI training agents to navigate in novel scenes like music rooms and daycares without human-constructed data which is a significant step forward in developing general-purpose embodied agents",

    "abstract": "The proliferation of large-scale AI models trained on extensive datasets has revolutionized machine learning. With these models taking on increasingly central roles in various applications the need to understand their behavior and enhance interpretability has become paramount. To investigate the impact of changes in training data on a pre-trained model a common approach is leave-one-out retraining. This entails systematically altering the training dataset by removing specific samples to observe resulting changes within the model. However retraining the model for each altered dataset presents a significant computational challenge given the need to perform this operation for every dataset variation. In this paper we introduce an efficient framework for assessing data impact comprising offline training and online evaluation stages. During the offline training phase we approximate the influence of training data on the target model through a distilled synset formulated as a reversed gradient matching problem. For online evaluation we expedite the leave-one-out process using the synset which is then utilized to compute the attribution matrix based on the evaluation objective. Experimental evaluations including training data attribution and assessments of data quality demonstrate that our proposed method achieves comparable model behavior evaluation while significantly speeding up the process compared to the direct retraining method",

    "abstract": "Diffusion models have achieved great success in synthesizing high-quality images. However generating high-resolution images with diffusion models is still challenging due to the enormous computational costs resulting in a prohibitive latency for interactive applications. In this paper we propose DistriFusion to tackle this problem by leveraging parallelism across multiple GPUs. Our method splits the model input into multiple patches and assigns each patch to a GPU. However naively implementing such an algorithm breaks the interaction between patches and loses fidelity while incorporating such an interaction will incur tremendous communication overhead. To overcome this dilemma we observe the high similarity between the input from adjacent diffusion steps and propose Displaced Patch Parallelism which takes advantage of the sequential nature of the diffusion process by reusing the pre-computed feature maps from the previous timestep to provide context for the current step. Therefore our method supports asynchronous communication which can be pipelined by computation. Extensive experiments show that our method can be applied to recent Stable Diffusion XL with no quality degradation and achieve up to a 6.1x speedup on eight NVIDIA A100s compared to one.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Recent self-training techniques have shown notable improvements in unsupervised domain adaptation for 3D object detection (3D UDA). These techniques typically select pseudo labels i.e. 3D boxes to supervise models for the target domain. However this selection process inevitably introduces unreliable 3D boxes in which 3D points cannot be definitively assigned as foreground or background. Previous techniques mitigate this by reweighting these boxes as pseudo labels but these boxes can still poison the training process. To resolve this problem in this paper we propose a novel pseudo label refinery framework. Specifically in the selection process to improve the reliability of pseudo boxes we propose a complementary augmentation strategy. This strategy involves either removing all points within an unreliable box or replacing it with a high-confidence box. Moreover the point numbers of instances in high-beam datasets are considerably higher than those in low-beam datasets also degrading the quality of pseudo labels during the training process. We alleviate this issue by generating additional proposals and aligning RoI features across different domains. Experimental results demonstrate that our method effectively enhances the quality of pseudo labels and consistently surpasses the state-of-the-art methods on six autonomous driving benchmarks.

    "abstract": "Geometry-agnostic system identification is a technique for identifying the geometry and physical properties of an object from video sequences without any geometric assumptions. Recently physics-augmented continuum neural radiance fields (PAC-NeRF) has demonstrated promising results for this technique by utilizing a hybrid Eulerian-Lagrangian representation in which the geometry is represented by the Eulerian grid representations of NeRF the physics is described by a material point method (MPM) and they are connected via Lagrangian particles. However a notable limitation of PAC-NeRF is that its performance is sensitive to the learning of the geometry from the first frames owing to its two-step optimization. First the grid representations are optimized with the first frames of video sequences and then the physical properties are optimized through video sequences utilizing the fixed first-frame grid representations. This limitation can be critical when learning of the geometric structure is difficult for example in a few-shot (sparse view) setting. To overcome this limitation we propose Lagrangian particle optimization (LPO) in which the positions and features of particles are optimized through video sequences in Lagrangian space. This method allows for the optimization of the geometric structure across the entire video sequence within the physical constraints imposed by the MPM. The experimental results demonstrate that the LPO is useful for geometric correction and physical identification in sparse-view settings",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Contrastive Vision-Language Pre-training known as CLIP has shown promising effectiveness in addressing downstream image recognition tasks. However recent works revealed that the CLIP model can be implanted with a downstream-oriented backdoor. On downstream tasks one victim model performs well on clean samples but predicts a specific target class whenever a specific trigger is present. For injecting a backdoor existing attacks depend on a large amount of additional data to maliciously fine-tune the entire pre-trained CLIP model which makes them inapplicable to data-limited scenarios. In this work motivated by the recent success of learnable prompts we address this problem by injecting a backdoor into the CLIP model in the prompt learning stage. Our method named BadCLIP is built on a novel and effective mechanism in backdoor attacks on CLIP i.e. influencing both the image and text encoders with the trigger. It consists of a learnable trigger applied to images and a trigger-aware context generator such that the trigger can change text features via trigger-aware prompts resulting in a powerful and generalizable attack. Extensive experiments conducted on 11 datasets verify that the clean accuracy of BadCLIP is similar to those of advanced prompt learning methods and the attack success rate is higher than 99% in most cases. BadCLIP is also generalizable to unseen classes and shows a strong generalization capability under cross-dataset and cross-domain settings.

    "title": "Beyond Image Super-Resolution for Image Recognition with Task-Driven Perceptual Loss",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "In real-world scenarios image recognition tasks such as semantic segmentation and object detection often pose greater challenges due to the lack of information available within low-resolution (LR) content. Image super-resolution (SR) is one of the promising solutions for addressing the challenges. However due to the ill-posed property of SR it is challenging for typical SR methods to restore task-relevant high-frequency contents which may dilute the advantage of utilizing the SR method. Therefore in this paper we propose Super-Resolution for Image Recognition (SR4IR) that effectively guides the generation of SR images beneficial to achieving satisfactory image recognition performance when processing LR images. The critical component of our SR4IR is the task-driven perceptual (TDP) loss that enables the SR network to acquire task-specific knowledge from a network tailored for a specific task. Moreover we propose a cross-quality patch mix and an alternate training framework that significantly enhances the efficacy of the TDP loss by addressing potential problems when employing the TDP loss. Through extensive experiments we demonstrate that our SR4IR achieves outstanding task performance by generating SR images useful for a specific image recognition task including semantic segmentation object detection and image classification.

    "abstract": "Applying a pre-trained large model to downstream tasks is prohibitive under resource-constrained conditions. Recent dominant approaches for addressing efficiency issues involve adding a few learnable parameters to the fixed backbone model. This strategy however leads to more challenges in loading large models for downstream fine-tuning with limited resources. In this paper we propose a novel method for increasing the parameter efficiency of pre-trained models by introducing an intermediate pre-training stage. To this end we first employ low-rank approximation to compress the original large model and then devise a feature distillation module and a weight perturbation regularization module. These modules are specifically designed to enhance the low-rank model. In particular we update only the low-rank model while freezing the backbone parameters during pre-training. This allows for direct and efficient utilization of the low-rank model for downstream fine-tuning tasks. The proposed method achieves both efficiencies in terms of required parameters and computation time while maintaining comparable results with minimal modifications to the backbone architecture. Specifically when applied to three vision-only and one vision-language Transformer models our approach often demonstrates a merely 0.6-point decrease in performance while reducing the original parameter size by 1/3 to 2/3",

Addressing this challenge we propose a reconstruction-free cascaded ACS method which requires NO reconstruction during the adaptive sampling process. A lightweight Score Network (ScoreNet) is proposed to directly determine the ACS allocation with previous CS measurements and a differentiable adaptive sampling module is proposed for end-to-end training. For image reconstruction we propose a Multi-Grid Spatial-Attention Network (MGSANet) that could facilitate efficient multi-stage training and inferencing.

    "abstract": "Both limited annotation and domain shift are prevalent challenges in medical image segmentation. Traditional semi-supervised segmentation and unsupervised domain adaptation methods address one of these issues separately. However the coexistence of limited annotation and domain shift is quite common which motivates us to introduce a novel and challenging scenario: Mixed Domain Semi-supervised medical image Segmentation (MiDSS). In this scenario we handle data from multiple medical centers with limited annotations available for a single domain and a large amount of unlabeled data from multiple domains. We found that the key to solving the problem lies in how to generate reliable pseudo labels for the unlabeled data in the presence of domain shift with labeled data. To tackle this issue we employ Unified Copy-Paste (UCP) between images to construct intermediate domains facilitating the knowledge transfer from the domain of labeled data to the domains of unlabeled data. To fully utilize the information within the intermediate domain we propose a symmetric Guidance training strategy (SymGD) which additionally offers direct guidance to unlabeled data by merging pseudo labels from intermediate samples. Subsequently we introduce a Training Process aware Random Amplitude MixUp (TP-RAM) to progressively incorporate style-transition components into intermediate samples.

These are usually tedious and cumbersome to obtain yet they are mandatory to triangulate corresponding pixels in 3D space which is at the core of all best performing MVS algorithms. In this work we take an opposite stance and introduce DUSt3R a radically novel paradigm for Dense and Unconstrained Stereo 3D Reconstruction of arbitrary image collections operating without prior information about camera calibration nor viewpoint poses. We cast the pairwise reconstruction problem as a regression of pointmaps relaxing the hard constraints of usual projective camera models. We show that this formulation smoothly unifies the monocular and binocular reconstruction cases. In the case where more than two images are provided we further propose a simple yet effective global alignment strategy that expresses all pairwise pointmaps in a common reference frame. We base our network architecture on standard Transformer encoders and decoders allowing us to leverage powerful pretrained models. Our formulation directly provides a 3D model of the scene as well as depth information but interestingly we can seamlessly recover from it pixel matches focal lengths relative and absolute cameras. Extensive experiments on all these tasks showcase how DUSt3R effectively unifies various 3D vision tasks setting new performance records on monocular & multi-view depth estimation as well as relative pose estimation.

Such paths capture rich information about the decision boundary. In this paper we propose a novel adversarially robust knowledge distillation approach by incorporating such adversarial paths into the alignment process. Recognizing the diverse impacts of intermediate adversarial samples (ranging from benign to noisy) we propose an adaptive weighting strategy to selectively emphasize informative adversarial samples thus ensuring efficient utilization of lightweight model capacity. Moreover we propose a dual-branch mechanism exploiting two following insights: (i) complementary dynamics of adversarial paths obtained by targeted and untargeted adversarial learning and (ii) inherent differences between the gradient ascent path from class c_i towards the nearest class boundary and the gradient descent path from a specific class c_j towards the decision region of c_i (i \\neq j).

As such label noise is mainly caused by a distribution mismatch and improper label assignments we are motivated to propose a label refinement approach for AT. Specifically our Self-Guided Label Refinement first self-refines a more accurate and informative label distribution from over-confident hard labels and then it calibrates the training by dynamically incorporating knowledge from self-distilled models into the current model and thus requiring no external teachers. Empirical results demonstrate that our method can simultaneously boost the standard accuracy and robust performance across multiple benchmark datasets attack types and architectures. In addition we also provide a set of analyses from the perspectives of information theory to dive into our method and suggest the importance of soft labels for robust generalization",

Weakly supervised M3D has recently been studied to obviate the 3D annotation process by leveraging many existing 2D annotations but it often requires extra training data such as LiDAR point clouds or multi-view images which greatly degrades its applicability and usability in various applications. We propose SKD-WM3D a weakly supervised monocular 3D detection framework that exploits depth information to achieve M3D with a single-view image exclusively without any 3D annotations or other training data. One key design in SKD-WM3D is a self-knowledge distillation framework which transforms image features into 3D-like representations by fusing depth information and effectively mitigates the inherent depth ambiguity in monocular scenarios with little computational overhead in inference. In addition we design an uncertainty-aware distillation loss and a gradient-targeted transfer modulation strategy which facilitate knowledge acquisition and knowledge transfer respectively. Extensive experiments show that SKD-WM3D surpasses the state-of-the-art clearly and is even on par with many fully supervised methods",

Towards harnessing the potential of diffusion models for ULD task we make the following core contributions. First we propose a ZeroShot ULD baseline based on simple clustering of random pixel locations with nearest neighbour matching. It delivers better results than the existing ULD methods. Second motivated by the ZeroShot performance we develop a ULD algorithm based on diffusion features using self-training and clustering which also outperforms prior methods by notable margins. Third we introduce a new proxy task based on generating latent pose codes and also propose a two-stage clustering mechanism to facilitate effective pseudo-labeling resulting in a significant performance improvement.

In this paper we present Text Grouping Adapter (TGA) a module that can enable the utilization of various pre-trained text detectors to learn layout analysis allowing us to adopt a well-trained text detector right off the shelf or just fine-tune it efficiently. Designed to be compatible with various text detector architectures TGA takes detected text regions and image features as universal inputs to assemble text instance features. To capture broader contextual information for layout analysis we propose to predict text group masks from text instance features by one-to-many assignment. Our comprehensive experiments demonstrate that even with frozen pre-trained models incorporating our TGA into various pre-trained text detectors and text spotters can achieve superior layout analysis performance simultaneously inheriting generalized text detection ability from pre-training.

    "abstract": "Whole Slide Image (WSI) classification is often formulated as a Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) problem. Recently Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance in WSI classification. However existing methods leverage coarse-grained pathogenetic descriptions for visual representation supervision which are insufficient to capture the complex visual appearance of pathogenetic images hindering the generalizability of models on diverse downstream tasks. Additionally processing high-resolution WSIs can be computationally expensive. In this paper we propose a novel \"Fine-grained Visual-Semantic Interaction\" (FiVE) framework for WSI classification. It is designed to enhance the model's generalizability by leveraging the interaction between localized visual patterns and fine-grained pathological semantics. Specifically with meticulously designed queries we start by utilizing a large language model to extract fine-grained pathological descriptions from various non-standardized raw reports. The output descriptions are then reconstructed into fine-grained labels used for training. By introducing a Task-specific Fine-grained Semantics (TFS) module we enable prompts to capture crucial visual information in WSIs which enhances representation learning and augments generalization capabilities significantly. Furthermore given that pathological visual patterns are redundantly distributed across tissue slices we sample a subset of visual instances during training. Our method demonstrates robust generalizability and strong transferability dominantly outperforming the counterparts on the TCGA Lung Cancer dataset with at least 9.19% higher accuracy in few-shot experiments.

Recent benchmarks do not address hallucinations in open-ended free-form responses which we term \"Type I hallucinations\".

Additionally such benchmarks often require external API calls to models which are subject to change. In practice we observe that a reduction in Type II hallucinations does not lead to a reduction in Type I hallucinations but rather that the two forms of hallucinations are often anti-correlated. To address this we propose THRONE a novel object-based automatic framework for quantitatively evaluating Type I hallucinations in LVLM free-form outputs. We use public language models (LMs) to identify hallucinations in LVLM responses and compute informative metrics. By evaluating a large selection of recent LVLMs using public datasets we show that an improvement in existing metrics do not lead to a reduction in Type I hallucinations and that established benchmarks for measuring Type I hallucinations are incomplete. Finally we provide a simple and effective data augmentation method to reduce Type I and Type II hallucinations as a strong baseline",

It is affected by many confounders owing to the complex wear mechanism and microscopic imaging which makes it difficult even for human experts to identify the worked material successfully. In this paper we investigate the following three questions on this unique vision task for the first time:(i) How well can state-of-the-art pre-trained models (like DINOv2) generalize to the rarely seen domain? (ii) How can few-shot learning be exploited for scarce microscopic images? (iii) How do the ambiguous magnification and sensing modality influence the classification accuracy? To study these we collaborated with archaeologists and built the first open-source and the largest LUWA dataset containing 23130 microscopic images with different magnifications and sensing modalities.

We present a unified method to simultaneously sparsify the viewgraph and remove false edges. We propose a scoring mechanism based on camera triplets that identifies edge redundancy as well as false edges. Our edge selection is formulated as an optimization problem which can be provably solved using a simple thresholding scheme. This results in a highly efficient algorithm which can be incorporated as a pre-processing step into any SfM pipeline making it practically usable. We demonstrate the utility of our method on generic and ambiguous datasets that cover the range of small medium and large-scale datasets all with different statistical properties.

Besides we change the original spatial attention to the proposed Latent-Shift Attention (LSA) for temporal consistency. With a similar model architecture we further train a video super-resolution model to generate high-definition (1024 x 1024) videos.

When designing an effective DIS model the main challenge is how to balance the semantic dispersion of high-resolution targets in the small receptive field and the loss of high-precision details in the large receptive field. Existing methods rely on tedious multiple encoder-decoder streams and stages to gradually complete the global localization and local refinement. Human visual system captures regions of interest by observing them from multiple views. Inspired by it we model DIS as a multi-view object perception problem and provide a parsimonious multi-view aggregation network (MVANet) which unifies the feature fusion of the distant view and close-up view into a single stream with one encoder-decoder structure. With the help of the proposed multi-view complementary localization and refinement modules our approach established long-range profound visual interactions across multiple views allowing the features of the detailed close-up view to focus on highly slender structures.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Diffusion-based text-to-video generation has witnessed impressive progress in the past year yet still falls behind text-to-image generation. One of the key reasons is the limited scale of publicly available data (e.g. 10M video-text pairs in WebVid10M vs. 5B image-text pairs in LAION) considering the high cost of video captioning. Instead it could be far easier to collect unlabeled clips from video platforms like YouTube. Motivated by this we come up with a novel text-to-video generation framework termed TF-T2V which can directly learn with text-free videos. The rationale behind is to separate the process of text decoding from that of temporal modeling. To this end we employ a content branch and a motion branch which are jointly optimized with weights shared. Following such a pipeline we study the effect of doubling the scale of training set (i.e. video-only WebVid10M) with some randomly collected text-free videos and are encouraged to observe the performance improvement (FID from 9.67 to 8.19 and FVD from 484 to 441) demonstrating the scalability of our approach. We also find that our model could enjoy sustainable performance gain (FID from 8.19 to 7.64 and FVD from 441 to 366) after reintroducing some text labels for training. Finally we validate the effectiveness and generalizability of our ideology on both native text-to-video generation and compositional video synthesis paradigms.

In many real-world scenarios the labeled molecules are limited in quantity or laborious to derive. Recent pseudo-labeling methods are usually designed based on a single domain knowledge thereby failing to understand the comprehensive molecular configurations and limiting their adaptability to generalize across diverse biochemical context. To this end we introduce an innovative paradigm for dealing with the molecule pseudo-labeling named as Molecular Data Programming (MDP). In particular we adopt systematic supervision sources via crafting multiple graph labeling functions which covers various molecular structural knowledge of graph kernels molecular fingerprints and topological features. Each of them creates an uncertain and biased labels for the unlabeled molecules. To address the decision conflicts among the diverse pseudo-labels we design a label synchronizer to differentiably model confidences and correlations between the labeling functions which yields probabilistic molecular labels to adapt for specific applications. These probabilistic molecular labels are used to train a molecular classifier for improving its generalization capability. On eight benchmark datasets we empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of MDP on the weakly supervised molecule classification tasks",

To address this issue we propose a novel Bi-Layout model capable of predicting two distinct layout types. One stops at ambiguous regions while the other extends to encompass all visible areas. Our model employs two global context embeddings where each embedding is designed to capture specific contextual information for each layout type. With our novel feature guidance module the image feature retrieves relevant context from these embeddings generating layout-aware features for precise bi-layout predictions. A unique property of our Bi-Layout model is its ability to inherently detect ambiguous regions by comparing the two predictions. To circumvent the need for manual correction of ambiguous annotations during testing we also introduce a new metric for disambiguating ground truth layouts. Our method demonstrates superior performance on benchmark datasets notably outperforming leading approaches.

This dual diffusion framework expands the denoising-based diffusion models initially uninterpretable for image restoration into a unified and interpretable model for both image generation and restoration by introducing residuals. Specifically our residual diffusion represents directional diffusion from the target image to the degraded input image and explicitly guides the reverse generation process for image restoration while noise diffusion represents random perturbations in the diffusion process. The residual prioritizes certainty while the noise emphasizes diversity enabling RDDM to effectively unify tasks with varying certainty or diversity requirements such as image generation and restoration. We demonstrate that our sampling process is consistent with that of DDPM and DDIM through coefficient transformation and propose a partially path-independent generation process to better understand the reverse process. Notably our RDDM enables a generic UNet trained with only an L1 loss and a batch size of 1 to compete with state-of-the-art image restoration methods.

    "abstract": "To defend deep neural networks from adversarial attacks adversarial training has been drawing increasing attention for its effectiveness. However the accuracy and robustness resulting from the adversarial training are limited by the architecture because adversarial training improves accuracy and robustness by adjusting the weight connection affiliated to the architecture. In this work we propose ARNAS to search for accurate and robust architectures for adversarial training. First we design an accurate and robust search space in which the placement of the cells and the proportional relationship of the filter numbers are carefully determined. With the design the architectures can obtain both accuracy and robustness by deploying accurate and robust structures to their sensitive positions respectively. Then we propose a differentiable multi-objective search strategy performing gradient descent towards directions that are beneficial for both natural loss and adversarial loss thus the accuracy and robustness can be guaranteed at the same time. We conduct comprehensive experiments in terms of white-box attacks black-box attacks and transferability. Experimental results show that the searched architecture has the strongest robustness with the competitive accuracy and breaks the traditional idea that NAS-based architectures cannot transfer well to complex tasks in robustness scenarios. By analyzing outstanding architectures searched we also conclude that accurate and robust neural architectures tend to deploy different structures near the input and output which has great practical significance on both hand-crafting and automatically designing of accurate and robust architectures",

    "abstract": "Existing multi-person human reconstruction approaches mainly focus on recovering accurate poses or avoiding penetration but overlook the modeling of close interactions. In this work we tackle the task of reconstructing closely interactive humans from a monocular video. The main challenge of this task comes from insufficient visual information caused by depth ambiguity and severe inter-person occlusion. In view of this we propose to leverage knowledge from proxemic behavior and physics to compensate the lack of visual information. This is based on the observation that human interaction has specific patterns following the social proxemics. Specifically we first design a latent representation based on Vector Quantised-Variational AutoEncoder (VQ-VAE) to model human interaction. A proxemics and physics guided diffusion model is then introduced to denoise the initial distribution. We design the diffusion model as dual branch with each branch representing one individual such that the interaction can be modeled via cross attention. With the learned priors of VQ-VAE and physical constraint as the additional information our proposed approach is capable of estimating accurate poses that are also proxemics and physics plausible.

In the context of classification the task of detecting images outside of a model's training domain is known as out-of-distribution (OOD) detection.

In this work we take a closer look at 20 state-of-the-art OOD detection methods in the (more realistic) scenario where the labels used to train the underlying classifier are unreliable (e.g. crowd-sourced or web-scraped labels). Extensive experiments across different datasets noise types & levels architectures and checkpointing strategies provide insights into the effect of class label noise on OOD detection and show that poor separation between incorrectly classified ID samples vs. OOD samples is an overlooked yet important limitation of existing methods.

In this paper we propose a new approach termed as VideoMAC which combines video masked autoencoders with resource-friendly ConvNets.

To prevent the issue of mask pattern dissipation we utilize ConvNets which are implemented with sparse convolutional operators as encoders.

In this paper we introduce a novel neural implicit representation based on unsigned orthogonal distance fields (UODFs). In UODFs the minimal unsigned distance from any spatial point to the shape surface is defined solely in one orthogonal direction contrasting with the multi-directional determination made by SDF and UDF. Consequently every point in the 3D UODFs can directly access its closest surface points along three orthogonal directions. This distinctive feature leverages the accurate reconstruction of surface points without interpolation errors.

To address this we introduce QA-ViT a Question Aware Vision Transformer approach for multimodal reasoning which embeds question awareness directly within the vision encoder. This integration results in dynamic visual features focusing on relevant image aspects to the posed question. QA-ViT is model-agnostic and can be incorporated efficiently into any VL architecture.

Our dataset represents real interiors and contains a diverse set of 18656 models of real-world objects. We investigate the impact of synthetic 3D scene dataset scale and realism on the task of training embodied agents to find and navigate to objects (ObjectGoal navigation). By comparing to synthetic 3D scene datasets from prior work we find that scale helps in generalization but the benefits quickly saturate making visual fidelity and correlation to real-world scenes more important. Our experiments show that agents trained on our smaller-scale dataset can match or outperform agents trained on much larger datasets. Surprisingly we observe that agents trained on just 122 scenes from our dataset outperform agents trained on 10000 scenes from the ProcTHOR-10K dataset in terms of zero-shot generalization in real-world scanned environments",

    "title": "OA-CNNs: Omni-Adaptive Sparse CNNs for 3D Semantic Segmentation",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "The booming of 3D recognition in the 2020s began with the introduction of point cloud transformers. They quickly overwhelmed sparse CNNs and became state-of-the-art models especially in 3D semantic segmentation. However sparse CNNs are still valuable networks due to their efficiency treasure and ease of application. In this work we reexamine the design distinctions and test the limits of what a sparse CNN can achieve. We discover that the key credit to the performance difference is adaptivity. Specifically we propose two key components i.e. adaptive receptive fields (spatially) and adaptive relation to bridge the gap. This exploration led to the creation of Omni-Adaptive 3D CNNs (OA-CNNs) a family of networks that integrates a lightweight module to greatly enhance the adaptivity of sparse CNNs at minimal computational cost. Without any self-attention modules OA-CNNs favorably surpass point transformers in terms of accuracy in both indoor and outdoor scenes with much less latency and memory cost. Notably it achieves 76.1% 78.9% and 70.6% mIoU on ScanNet v2 nuScenes and SemanticKITTI validation benchmarks respectively while maintaining at most 5x better speed than transformer counterparts. This revelation highlights the potential of pure sparse CNNs to outperform transformer-related networks.

    "abstract": "Comprehensive capturing of human motions requires both accurate captures of complex poses and precise localization of the human within scenes. Most of the HPE datasets and methods primarily rely on RGB LiDAR or IMU data. However solely using these modalities or a combination of them may not be adequate for HPE particularly for complex and fast movements. For holistic human motion understanding we present RELI11D a high-quality multimodal human motion dataset involves LiDAR IMU system RGB camera and Event camera. It records the motions of 10 actors performing 5 sports in 7 scenes including 3.32 hours of synchronized LiDAR point clouds IMU measurement data RGB videos and Event steams. Through extensive experiments we demonstrate that the RELI11D presents considerable challenges and opportunities as it contains many rapid and complex motions that require precise location. To address the challenge of integrating different modalities we propose LEIR a multimodal baseline that effectively utilizes LiDAR Point Cloud Event stream and RGB through our cross-attention fusion strategy. We show that LEIR exhibits promising results for rapid motions and daily motions and that utilizing the characteristics of multiple modalities can indeed improve HPE performance.

Given a single image our trained model uses a frequency-coordinated diffusion sampling process to predict a spectral volume which can be converted into a motion texture that spans an entire video. Along with an image-based rendering module the predicted motion representation can be used for a number of downstream applications such as turning still images into seamlessly looping videos or allowing users to interact with objects in real images producing realistic simulated dynamics (by interpreting the spectral volumes as image-space modal bases).

    "title": "One-Class Face Anti-spoofing via Spoof Cue Map-Guided Feature Learning",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Many face anti-spoofing (FAS) methods have focused on learning discriminative features from both live and spoof training data to strengthen the security of face recognition systems. However since not every possible attack type is available in the training stage these FAS methods usually fail to detect unseen attacks in the inference stage. In comparison one-class FAS where the training data are from only live faces aims to detect whether a test face image belongs to the live class or not. In this paper we propose a novel One-Class Spoof Cue Map estimation Network (OC-SCMNet) to address the one-class FAS detection problem. Our first goal is to learn to extract latent spoof features from live images so that their estimated Spoof Cue Maps (SCMs) should have zero responses. To avoid trapping to a trivial solution we devise a novel SCM-guided feature learning by combining many SCMs as pseudo ground-truths to guide a conditional generator to generate latent spoof features for spoof data. Our second goal is to approximately simulate the potential out-of-distribution spoof attacks. To this end we propose using a memory bank to dynamically preserve a set of sufficiently \"independent\" latent spoof features to encourage the generator to probe the latent spoof feature space. Extensive experiments conducted on eight FAS benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed OC-SCMNet not only outperforms previous one-class FAS methods but also achieves comparable performances to state-of-the-art two-class FAS method.

Conjointly test-time augmentation which utilizes multiple augmented views of a single image to enhance zero-shot generalization is emerging as a significant area of interest. This has predominantly directed research efforts towards test-time prompt tuning. In contrast we introduce a robust MeanShift for Test-time Augmentation (MTA) which surpasses prompt-based methods without requiring this intensive training procedure. This positions MTA as an ideal solution for both standalone and API-based applications. Additionally our method does not rely on ad hoc rules (e.g. confidence threshold) used in some previous test-time augmentation techniques to filter the augmented views. Instead MTA incorporates a quality assessment variable for each view directly into its optimization process termed as the inlierness score. This score is jointly optimized with a density mode seeking process leading to an efficient training- and hyperparameter-free approach. We extensively benchmark our method on 15 datasets and demonstrate MTA's superiority and computational efficiency. Deployed easily as plug-and-play module on top of zero-shot models and state-of-the-art few-shot methods MTA shows systematic and consistent improvements",

    "abstract": "Large-scale text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models have showcased incredible capabilities in generating coherent images based on textual descriptions enabling vast applications in content generation. While recent advancements have introduced control over factors such as object localization posture and image contours a crucial gap remains in our ability to control the interactions between objects in the generated content. Well-controlling interactions in generated images could yield meaningful applications such as creating realistic scenes with interacting characters. In this work we study the problems of conditioning T2I diffusion models with Human-Object Interaction (HOI) information consisting of a triplet label (person action object) and corresponding bounding boxes. We propose a pluggable interaction control model called InteractDiffusion that extends existing pre-trained T2I diffusion models to enable them being better conditioned on interactions. Specifically we tokenize the HOI information and learn their relationships via interaction embeddings. A conditioning self-attention layer is trained to map HOI tokens to visual tokens thereby conditioning the visual tokens better in existing T2I diffusion models. Our model attains the ability to control the interaction and location on existing T2I diffusion models which outperforms existing baselines by a large margin in HOI detection score as well as fidelity in FID and KID.

    "abstract": "We propose NViST a transformer-based model for efficient and generalizable novel-view synthesis from a single image for real-world scenes. In contrast to many methods that are trained on synthetic data object-centred scenarios or in a category-specific manner NViST is trained on MVImgNet a large-scale dataset of casually-captured real-world videos of hundreds of object categories with diverse backgrounds. NViST transforms image inputs directly into a radiance field conditioned on camera parameters via adaptive layer normalisation. In practice NViST exploits fine-tuned masked autoencoder (MAE) features and translates them to 3D output tokens via cross-attention while addressing occlusions with self-attention. To move away from object-centred datasets and enable full scene synthesis NViST adopts a 6-DOF camera pose model and only requires relative pose dropping the need for canonicalization of the training data which removes a substantial barrier to it being used on casually captured datasets. We show results on unseen objects and categories from MVImgNet and even generalization to casual phone captures. We conduct qualitative and quantitative evaluations on MVImgNet and ShapeNet to show that our model represents a step forward towards enabling true in-the-wild generalizable novel-view synthesis from a single image.

Traditional Referring Image Segmentation (RIS) approaches have been impeded by the complex spatial scales and orientations found in aerial imagery leading to suboptimal segmentation results. To address these challenges we introduce the Rotated Multi-Scale Interaction Network (RMSIN) an innovative approach designed for the unique demands of RRSIS. RMSIN incorporates an Intra-scale Interaction Module (IIM) to effectively address the fine-grained detail required at multiple scales and a Cross-scale Interaction Module (CIM) for integrating these details coherently across the network. Furthermore RMSIN employs an Adaptive Rotated Convolution (ARC) to account for the diverse orientations of objects a novel contribution that significantly enhances segmentation accuracy. To assess the efficacy of RMSIN we have curated an expansive dataset comprising 17402 image-caption-mask triplets which is unparalleled in terms of scale and variety. This dataset not only presents the model with a wide range of spatial and rotational scenarios but also establishes a stringent benchmark for the RRSIS task ensuring a rigorous evaluation of performance.

    "abstract": "Scene coordinate regression (SCR) methods are a family of visual localization methods that directly regress 2D-3D matches for camera pose estimation. They are effective in small-scale scenes but face significant challenges in large-scale scenes that are further amplified in the absence of ground truth 3D point clouds for supervision. Here the model can only rely on reprojection constraints and needs to implicitly triangulate the points. The challenges stem from a fundamental dilemma: The network has to be invariant to observations of the same landmark at different viewpoints and lighting conditions etc. but at the same time discriminate unrelated but similar observations. The latter becomes more relevant and severe in larger scenes. In this work we tackle this problem by introducing the concept of co-visibility to the network. We propose GLACE which integrates pre-trained global and local encodings and enables SCR to scale to large scenes with only a single small-sized network. Specifically we propose a novel feature diffusion technique that implicitly groups the reprojection constraints with co-visibility and avoids overfitting to trivial solutions. Additionally our position decoder parameterizes the output positions for large-scale scenes more effectively. Without using 3D models or depth maps for supervision our method achieves state-of-the-art results on large-scale scenes with a low-map-size model. On Cambridge landmarks with a single model we achieve a 17% lower median position error than Poker the ensemble variant of the state-of-the-art SCR method ACE.

However these datasets revisit the same geographic locations across training validation and test sets. Specifically over 80% of nuScenes and 40% of Argoverse 2 validation and test samples are less than 5 m from a training sample. At test time the methods are thus evaluated more on how well they localize within a memorized implicit map built from the training data than on extrapolating to unseen locations. Naturally this data leakage causes inflated performance numbers and we propose geographically disjoint data splits to reveal the true performance in unseen environments. Experimental results show that methods perform considerably worse some dropping more than 45 mAP when trained and evaluated on proper data splits. Additionally a reassessment of prior design choices reveals diverging conclusions from those based on the original split.

    "abstract": "This work presents Depth Anything a highly practical solution for robust monocular depth estimation. Without pursuing novel technical modules we aim to build a simple yet powerful foundation model dealing with any images under any circumstances. To this end we scale up the dataset by designing a data engine to collect and automatically annotate large-scale unlabeled data ( 62M) which significantly enlarges the data coverage and thus is able to reduce the generalization error. We investigate two simple yet effective strategies that make data scaling-up promising. First a more challenging optimization target is created by leveraging data augmentation tools. It compels the model to actively seek extra visual knowledge and acquire robust representations. Second an auxiliary supervision is developed to enforce the model to inherit rich semantic priors from pre-trained encoders. We evaluate its zero-shot capabilities extensively including six public datasets and randomly captured photos. It demonstrates impressive generalization ability. Further through fine-tuning it with metric depth information from NYUv2 and KITTI new SOTAs are set. Our better depth model also results in a better depth-conditioned ControlNet.

    "abstract": "We present a new self-supervised approach SelfPose3d for estimating 3d poses of multiple persons from multiple camera views. Unlike current state-of-the-art fully-supervised methods our approach does not require any 2d or 3d ground-truth poses and uses only the multi-view input images from a calibrated camera setup and 2d pseudo poses generated from an off-the-shelf 2d human pose estimator. We propose two self-supervised learning objectives: self-supervised person localization in 3d space and self-supervised 3d pose estimation. We achieve self-supervised 3d person localization by training the model on synthetically generated 3d points serving as 3d person root positions and on the projected root-heatmaps in all the views. We then model the 3d poses of all the localized persons with a bottleneck representation map them onto all views obtaining 2d joints and render them using 2d Gaussian heatmaps in an end-to-end differentiable manner. Afterwards we use the corresponding 2d joints and heatmaps from the pseudo 2d poses for learning. To alleviate the intrinsic inaccuracy of the pseudo labels we propose an adaptive supervision attention mechanism to guide the self-supervision. Our experiments and analysis on three public benchmark datasets including Panoptic Shelf and Campus show the effectiveness of our approach which is comparable to fully-supervised methods.

We present Mixture of Data Experts (MoDE) and learn a system of CLIP data experts via clustering. Each data expert is trained on one data cluster being less sensitive to false negative noises in other clusters. At inference time we ensemble their outputs by applying weights determined through the correlation between task metadata and cluster conditions. To estimate the correlation precisely the samples in one cluster should be semantically similar but the number of data experts should still be reasonable for training and inference. As such we consider the ontology in human language and propose to use fine-grained cluster centers to represent each data expert at a coarse-grained level. Experimental studies show that four CLIP data experts on ViT-B/16 outperform the ViT-L/14 by OpenAI CLIP and OpenCLIP on zero-shot image classification but with less (<35%) training cost.

    "abstract": "3D human generation is increasingly significant in various applications. However the direct use of 2D generative methods in 3D generation often results in losing local details while methods that reconstruct geometry from generated images struggle with global view consistency. In this work we introduce Joint2Human a novel method that leverages 2D diffusion models to generate detailed 3D human geometry directly ensuring both global structure and local details. To achieve this we employ the Fourier occupancy field (FOF) representation enabling the direct generation of 3D shapes as preliminary results with 2D generative models. With the proposed high-frequency enhancer and the multi-view recarving strategy our method can seamlessly integrate the details from different views into a uniform global shape. To better utilize the 3D human prior and enhance control over the generated geometry we introduce a compact spherical embedding of 3D joints. This allows for an effective guidance of pose during the generation process. Additionally our method can generate 3D humans guided by textual inputs. Our experimental results demonstrate the capability of our method to ensure global structure local details high resolution and low computational cost simultaneously.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Text-to-image (T2I) research has grown explosively in the past year owing to the large-scale pre-trained diffusion models and many emerging personalization and editing approaches. Yet one pain point persists: the text prompt engineering and searching high-quality text prompts for customized results is more art than science. Moreover as commonly argued: \"an image is worth a thousand words\" - the attempt to describe a desired image with texts often ends up being ambiguous and cannot comprehensively cover delicate visual details hence necessitating more additional controls from the visual domain. In this paper we take a bold step forward: taking \"Text\" out of a pretrained T2I diffusion model to reduce the burdensome prompt engineering efforts for users. Our proposed framework Prompt-Free Diffusion relies on only visual inputs to generate new images: it takes a reference image as \"context\" an optional image structural conditioning and an initial noise with absolutely no text prompt. The core architecture behind the scene is Semantic Context Encoder (SeeCoder) substituting the commonly used CLIP-based or LLM-based text encoder. The reusability of SeeCoder also makes it a convenient drop-in component: one can also pre-train a SeeCoder in one T2I model and reuse it for another. Through extensive experiments Prompt-Free Diffusion is experimentally found to (i) outperform prior exemplar-based image synthesis approaches; (ii) perform on par with state-of-the-art T2I models using prompts following the best practice; and (iii) be naturally extensible to other downstream applications such as anime figure generation and virtual try-on with promising quality.

    "abstract": "Recent advancements in single image driven 3D content generation have been propelled by leveraging prior knowledge from pretrained 2D diffusion models. However the 3D content generated by existing methods often exhibits distorted outline shapes and inadequate details. To solve this problem we propose a novel framework called Mask-enhanced Progressive Outline-to-Detail optimization (aka. MPOD123) which consists of two stages. Specifically in the first stage MPOD123 utilizes the pretrained view-conditioned diffusion model to guide the outline shape optimization of the 3D content. Given certain viewpoint we estimate outline shape priors in the form of 2D mask from the 3D content by leveraging opacity calculation. In the second stage MPOD123 incorporates Detail Appearance Inpainting (DAI) to guide the refinement on local geometry and texture with the shape priors. The essence of DAI lies in the Mask Rectified Cross-Attention (MRCA) which can be conveniently plugged in the stable diffusion model. The MRCA module utilizes the mask to rectify the attention map from each cross-attention layer. Accompanied with this new module DAI is capable of guiding the detail refinement of the 3D content while better preserves the outline shape. To assess the applicability in practical scenarios we contribute a new dataset modeled on real-world e-commerce environments. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments on this dataset and open benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of MPOD123 over the state-of-the-arts",

However challenges in modeling the multi-modal nature of human motion and intricate interactions among agents persist particularly with longer timescales and more agents. In this paper we propose an interaction-aware trajectory-conditioned long-term multi-agent human pose forecasting model utilizing a coarse-to-fine prediction approach: multi-modal global trajectories are initially forecasted followed by respective local pose forecasts conditioned on each mode. In doing so our Trajectory2Pose model introduces a graph-based agent-wise interaction module for a reciprocal forecast of local motion-conditioned global trajectory and trajectory-conditioned local pose. Our model effectively handles the multi-modality of human motion and the complexity of long-term multi-agent interactions improving performance in complex environments. Furthermore we address the lack of long-term (6s+) multi-agent (5+) datasets by constructing a new dataset from real-world images and 2D annotations enabling a comprehensive evaluation of our proposed model.

In this work we demonstrate that a critical and distinct challenge in 3D vision language reasoning is the situational awareness which incorporates two key components: (1) The autonomous agent grounds its self-location based on a language prompt. (2) The agent answers open-ended questions from the perspective of its calculated position. To address this challenge we introduce SIG3D an end-to-end Situation-Grounded model for 3D vision language reasoning. We tokenize the 3D scene into sparse voxel representation and propose a language-grounded situation estimator followed by a situated question answering module. Experiments on the SQA3D and ScanQA datasets show that SIG3D outperforms state-of-the-art models in situational estimation and question answering by a large margin (e.g. an enhancement of over 30% on situation accuracy). Subsequent analysis corroborates our architectural design choices explores the distinct functions of visual and textual tokens and highlights the importance of situational awareness in the domain of 3D question-answering.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Three-dimensional object detection is one of the key tasks in autonomous driving. To reduce costs in practice low-cost multi-view cameras for 3D object detection are proposed to replace the expansive LiDAR sensors. However relying solely on cameras is difficult to achieve highly accurate and robust 3D object detection. An effective solution to this issue is combining multi-view cameras with the economical millimeter-wave radar sensor to achieve more reliable multi-modal 3D object detection. In this paper we introduce RCBEVDet a radar-camera fusion 3D object detection method in the bird's eye view (BEV). Specifically we first design RadarBEVNet for radar BEV feature extraction. RadarBEVNet consists of a dual-stream radar backbone and a Radar Cross-Section (RCS) aware BEV encoder. In the dual-stream radar backbone a point-based encoder and a transformer-based encoder are proposed to extract radar features with an injection and extraction module to facilitate communication between the two encoders. The RCS-aware BEV encoder takes RCS as the object size prior to scattering the point feature in BEV. Besides we present the Cross-Attention Multi-layer Fusion module to automatically align the multi-modal BEV feature from radar and camera with the deformable attention mechanism and then fuse the feature with channel and spatial fusion layers. Experimental results show that RCBEVDet achieves new state-of-the-art radar-camera fusion results on nuScenes and view-of-delft (VoD) 3D object detection benchmarks. Furthermore RCBEVDet achieves better 3D detection results than all real-time camera-only and radar-camera 3D object detectors with a faster inference speed at 21 28 FPS.

To alleviate the annotation burden contrastive learning has attracted increasing attention for tackling semi-supervised 3D semantic segmentation. However existing point-to-point contrastive learning techniques in literature are generally sensitive to outliers resulting in insufficient modeling of the point-wise representations. To address this problem we propose a method named DDSemi for semi-supervised 3D semantic segmentation where a density-guided contrastive learning technique is explored. This technique calculates the contrastive loss in a point-to-anchor manner by estimating an anchor for each class from the memory bank based on the finding that the cluster centers tend to be located in dense regions. In this technique an inter-contrast loss is derived from the perturbed unlabeled point cloud pairs while an intra-contrast loss is derived from a single unlabeled point cloud. The derived losses could enhance the discriminability of the features and implicitly constrain the semantic consistency between the perturbed unlabeled point cloud pairs. In addition we propose a dual-space hardness sampling strategy to pay more attention to the hard samples located in sparse regions of both the geometric space and feature space by reweighting the point-wise intra-contrast loss. Experimental results on both indoor-scene and outdoor-scene datasets demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the comparative state-of-the-art semi-supervised methods",

In this paper we re-examine the existing availability attack methods and propose a novel two-stage min-max-min optimization paradigm to generate robust unlearnable noise. The inner min stage is utilized to generate unlearnable noise while the outer min-max stage simulates the training process of the poisoned model.

We propose ElasticDiffusion a novel training-free decoding method that enables pretrained text-to-image diffusion models to generate images with various sizes. ElasticDiffusion attempts to decouple the generation trajectory of a pretrained model into local and global signals. The local signal controls low-level pixel information and can be estimated on local patches while the global signal is used to maintain overall structural consistency and is estimated with a reference image. We test our method on CelebA-HQ (faces) and LAION-COCO (objects/indoor/outdoor scenes). Our experiments and qualitative results show superior image coherence quality across aspect ratios compared to MultiDiffusion and the standard decoding strategy of Stable Diffusion.

    "abstract": "We present the Locally Adaptive Morphable Model (LAMM) a highly flexible Auto-Encoder (AE) framework for learning to generate and manipulate 3D meshes. We train our architecture following a simple self-supervised training scheme in which input displacements over a set of sparse control vertices are used to overwrite the encoded geometry in order to transform one training sample into another. During inference our model produces a dense output that adheres locally to the specified sparse geometry while maintaining the overall appearance of the encoded object. This approach results in state-of-the-art performance in both disentangling manipulated geometry and 3D mesh reconstruction. To the best of our knowledge LAMM is the first end-to-end framework that enables direct local control of 3D vertex geometry in a single forward pass. A very efficient computational graph allows our network to train with only a fraction of the memory required by previous methods and run faster during inference generating 12k vertex meshes at >60fps on a single CPU thread. We further leverage local geometry control as a primitive for higher level editing operations and present a set of derivative capabilities such as swapping and sampling object parts.

In addition accessible multi-person sports video datasets lack fine-grained action annotations in both space and time adding to the difficulty in fine-grained action analysis. To this end we construct a new multi-person basketball sports video dataset named FineSports which contains fine-grained semantic and spatial-temporal annotations on 10000 NBA game videos covering 52 fine-grained action types 16000 action instances and 123000 spatial-temporal bounding boxes.

To this end we introduce Semantic Hierarchy Nexus (SHiNe) a novel classifier that uses semantic knowledge from class hierarchies. It runs offline in three steps: i) it retrieves relevant super-/sub-categories from a hierarchy for each target class; ii) it integrates these categories into hierarchy-aware sentences; iii) it fuses these sentence embeddings to generate the nexus classifier vector. Our evaluation on various detection benchmarks demonstrates that SHiNe enhances robustness across diverse vocabulary granularities achieving up to +31.9% mAP50 with ground truth hierarchies while retaining improvements using hierarchies generated by large language models. Moreover when applied to open-vocabulary classification on ImageNet-1k SHiNe improves the CLIP zero-shot baseline by +2.8% accuracy.

In this paper we propose TI2V-Zero a zero-shot tuning-free method that empowers a pretrained text-to-video (T2V) diffusion model to be conditioned on a provided image enabling TI2V generation without any optimization fine-tuning or introducing external modules. Our approach leverages a pretrained T2V diffusion foundation model as the generative prior. To guide video generation with the additional image input we propose a \"repeat-and-slide\" strategy that modulates the reverse denoising process allowing the frozen diffusion model to synthesize a video frame-by-frame starting from the provided image. To ensure temporal continuity we employ a DDPM inversion strategy to initialize Gaussian noise for each newly synthesized frame and a resampling technique to help preserve visual details. We conduct comprehensive experiments on both domain-specific and open-domain datasets where TI2V-Zero consistently outperforms a recent open-domain TI2V model. Furthermore we show that TI2V-Zero can seamlessly extend to other tasks such as video infilling and prediction when provided with more images.

    "abstract": "This paper focuses on open-ended video question answering which aims to find the correct answers from a large answer set in response to a video-related question. This is essentially a multi-label classification task since a question may have multiple answers. However due to annotation costs the labels in existing benchmarks are always extremely insufficient typically one answer per question. As a result existing works tend to directly treat all the unlabeled answers as negative labels leading to limited ability for generalization. In this work we introduce a simple yet effective ranking distillation framework (RADI) to mitigate this problem without additional manual annotation. RADI employs a teacher model trained with incomplete labels to generate rankings for potential answers which contain rich knowledge about label priority as well as label-associated visual cues thereby enriching the insufficient labeling information. To avoid overconfidence in the imperfect teacher model we further present two robust and parameter-free ranking distillation approaches: a pairwise approach which introduces adaptive soft margins to dynamically refine the optimization constraints on various pairwise rankings and a listwise approach which adopts sampling-based partial listwise learning to resist the bias in teacher ranking. Extensive experiments on five popular benchmarks consistently show that both our pairwise and listwise RADIs outperform state-of-the-art methods. Further analysis demonstrates the effectiveness of our methods on the insufficient labeling problem",

We propose Group Anything with Radiance Fields (GARField) an approach for decomposing 3D scenes into a hierarchy of semantically meaningful groups from posed image inputs. To do this we embrace group ambiguity through physical scale: by optimizing a scale-conditioned 3D affinity feature field a point in the world can belong to different groups of different sizes. We optimize this field from a set of 2D masks provided by Segment Anything (SAM) in a way that respects coarse-to-fine hierarchy using scale to consistently fuse conflicting masks from different viewpoints. From this field we can derive a hierarchy of possible groupings via automatic tree construction or user interaction. We evaluate GARField on a variety of in-the-wild scenes and find it effectively extracts groups at many levels: clusters of objects objects and various subparts. GARField inherently represents multi-view consistent groupings and produces higher fidelity groups than the input SAM masks. GARField's hierarchical grouping could have exciting downstream applications such as 3D asset extraction or dynamic scene understanding. Project site: https://www.garfield.studio/",

    "abstract": "Concealed Object Detection (COD) aims to identify objects visually embedded in their background. Existing COD datasets and methods predominantly focus on animals or humans ignoring the agricultural domain which often contains numerous small and concealed crops with severe occlusions. In this paper we introduce Concealed Crop Detection (CCD) which extends classic COD to agricultural domains. Experimental study shows that unimodal data provides insufficient information for CCD. To address this gap we first collect a large-scale RGB-D dataset ACOD-12K containing high-resolution crop images and depth maps. Then we propose a foundational framework named Recurrent Iterative Segmentation Network (RISNet). To tackle the challenge of dense objects we employ multi-scale receptive fields to capture objects of varying sizes thus enhancing the detection performance for dense objects. By fusing depth features our method can acquire spatial information about concealed objects to mitigate disturbances caused by intricate backgrounds and occlusions. Furthermore our model adopts a multi-stage iterative approach using predictions from each stage as gate attention to reinforce position information thereby improving the detection accuracy for small objects. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our RISNet achieves new state-of-the-art performance on both newly proposed CCD and classic COD tasks.

    "abstract": "Generalized Category Discovery (GCD) aims to identify a mix of known and novel categories within unlabeled data sets providing a more realistic setting for image recognition. Essentially GCD needs to remember existing patterns thoroughly to recognize novel categories. Recent state-of-the-art method SimGCD transfers the knowledge from known-class data to the learning of novel classes through debiased learning. However some patterns are catastrophically forgot during adaptation and thus lead to poor performance in novel categories classification. To address this issue we propose a novel learning approach LegoGCD which is seamlessly integrated into previous methods to enhance the discrimination of novel classes while maintaining performance on previously encountered known classes. Specifically we design two types of techniques termed as \\underline L ocal \\underline E ntropy Re\\underline g ularization (LER) and Dual-views Kullback-Leibler divergence c\\underline o nstraint (DKL). The LER optimizes the distribution of potential known class samples in unlabeled data thus ensuring the preservation of knowledge related to known categories while learning novel classes. Meanwhile DKL introduces Kullback-Leibler divergence to encourage the model to produce a similar prediction distribution of two view samples from the same image. In this way it successfully avoids mismatched prediction and generates more reliable potential known class samples simultaneously. Extensive experiments validate that the proposed LegoGCD effectively addresses the known category forgetting issue across all datasets e.g. delivering a 7.74% and 2.51% accuracy boost on known and novel classes in CUB respectively.

    "abstract": "4D medical images which represent 3D images with temporal information are crucial in clinical practice for capturing dynamic changes and monitoring long-term disease progression. However acquiring 4D medical images poses challenges due to factors such as radiation exposure and imaging duration necessitating a balance between achieving high temporal resolution and minimizing adverse effects. Given these circumstances not only is data acquisition challenging but increasing the frame rate for each dataset also proves difficult. To address this challenge this paper proposes a simple yet effective Unsupervised Volumetric Interpolation framework UVI-Net. This framework facilitates temporal interpolation without the need for any intermediate frames distinguishing it from the majority of other existing unsupervised methods. Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate significant improvements across diverse evaluation metrics compared to unsupervised and supervised baselines. Remarkably our approach achieves this superior performance even when trained with a dataset as small as one highlighting its exceptional robustness and efficiency in scenarios with sparse supervision. This positions UVI-Net as a compelling alternative for 4D medical imaging particularly in settings where data availability is limited.

This arrangement provides an effective approach for the widespread application of RL in high-risk scenarios where both cumulative and state-wise costs need to be considered simultaneously. However previously constrained offline RL algorithms are primarily designed to handle single-constraint problems related to cumulative cost which faces challenges when addressing multi-constraint tasks that involve both cumulative and state-wise costs. In this work we propose a novel Primal policy Optimization with Conservative Estimation algorithm (POCE) to address the problem of multi-constraint offline RL. Concretely we reframe the objective of multi-constraint offline RL by introducing the concept of Maximum Markov Decision Processes (MMDP). Subsequently we present a primal policy optimization algorithm to confront the multi-constraint problems which improves the stability and convergence speed of model training. Furthermore we propose a conditional Bellman operator to estimate cumulative and state-wise Q-values reducing the extrapolation error caused by out-of-distribution (OOD) actions. Finally extensive experiments demonstrate that the POCE algorithm achieves competitive performance across multiple experimental tasks particularly outperforming baseline algorithms in terms of safety.

One crucial bottleneck of modeling animals is the limited availability of training data which we overcome by learning our model from 2D Internet images. We show that prior approaches which are category-specific fail to generalize to rare species with limited training images. We address this challenge by introducing the Semantic Bank of Skinned Models (SBSM) which automatically discovers a small set of base animal shapes by combining geometric inductive priors with semantic knowledge implicitly captured by an off-the-shelf self-supervised feature extractor. To train such a model we also contribute a new large-scale dataset of diverse animal species. At inference time given a single image of any quadruped animal our model reconstructs an articulated 3D mesh in a feed-forward manner in seconds",

However existing research on depth completion assumes that the sparsity --- the number of points or LiDAR lines --- is fixed for training and testing. Hence the completion performance drops severely when the number of sparse depths changes significantly. To address this issue we propose the sparsity-adaptive depth refinement (SDR) framework which refines monocular depth estimates using sparse depth points. For SDR we propose the masked spatial propagation network (MSPN) to perform SDR with a varying number of sparse depths effectively by gradually propagating sparse depth information throughout the entire depth map.

Remarkably LISA can handle cases involving complex reasoning and world knowledge. Also it demonstrates robust zero-shot capability when trained exclusively on reasoning-free datasets. In addition fine-tuning the model with merely 239 reasoning segmentation data samples results in further performance enhancement.

    "abstract": "Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) have shown great potential in novel view synthesis. However they struggle to render sharp images when the data used for training is affected by motion blur. On the other hand event cameras excel in dynamic scenes as they measure brightness changes with microsecond resolution and are thus only marginally affected by blur. Recent methods attempt to enhance NeRF reconstructions under camera motion by fusing frames and events. However they face challenges in recovering accurate color content or constrain the NeRF to a set of predefined camera poses harming reconstruction quality in challenging conditions. This paper proposes a novel formulation addressing these issues by leveraging both model- and learning-based modules. We explicitly model the blur formation process exploiting the event double integral as an additional model-based prior. Additionally we model the event-pixel response using an end-to-end learnable response function allowing our method to adapt to non-idealities in the real event-camera sensor.

C3Net adapts the ControlNet architecture to jointly train and make inferences on a production-ready diffusion model and its trainable copies. Specifically C3Net first aligns the conditions from multi-modalities to the same semantic latent space using modality-specific encoders based on contrastive training. Then it generates multimodal outputs based on the aligned latent space whose semantic information is combined using a ControlNet-like architecture called Control C3-UNet. Correspondingly with this system design our model offers an improved solution for joint-modality generation through learning and explaining multimodal conditions involving more than just linear interpolation within the latent space. Meanwhile as we align conditions to a unified latent space C3Net only requires one trainable Control C3-UNet to work on multimodal semantic information. Furthermore our model employs unimodal pretraining on the condition alignment stage outperforming the non-pretrained alignment even on relatively scarce training data and thus demonstrating high-quality compound condition generation. We contribute the first high-quality tri-modal validation set to validate quantitatively that C3Net outperforms or is on par with the first and contemporary state-of-the-art multimodal generation.

    "abstract": "Neural network pruning particularly channel pruning is a widely used technique for compressing deep learning models to enable their deployment on edge devices with limited resources. Typically redundant weights or structures are removed to achieve the target resource budget. Although data-driven pruning approaches have proven to be more effective they cannot be directly applied to federated learning (FL) which has emerged as a popular technique in edge computing applications because of distributed and confidential datasets. In response to this challenge we design a new network pruning method for FL. We propose device-wise sub-networks for each device assuming that the data distribution is similar within each device. These sub-networks are generated through sub-network embeddings and a hypernetwork. To further minimize memory usage and communication costs we permanently prune the full model to remove weights that are not useful for all devices. During the FL process we simultaneously train the device-wise sub-networks and the base sub-network to facilitate the pruning process. We then finetune the pruned model with device-wise sub-networks to regain performance. Moreover we provided the theoretical guarantee of convergence for our method. Our method achieves better performance and resource trade-off than other well-established network pruning baselines as demonstrated through extensive experiments on CIFAR-10 CIFAR-100 and TinyImageNet",

    "abstract": "Few-shot segmentation performance declines substantially when facing images from a domain different than the training domain effectively limiting real-world use cases. To alleviate this recently cross-domain few-shot segmentation (CD-FSS) has emerged. Works that address this task mainly attempted to learn segmentation on a source domain in a manner that generalizes across domains. Surprisingly we can outperform these approaches while eliminating the training stage and removing their main segmentation network. We show test-time task-adaption is the key for successful CD-FSS instead. Task-adaption is achieved by appending small networks to the feature pyramid of a conventionally classification-pretrained backbone. To avoid overfitting to the few labeled samples in supervised fine-tuning consistency across augmented views of input images serves as guidance while learning the parameters of the attached layers. Despite our self-restriction not to use any images other than the few labeled samples at test time we achieve new state-of-the-art performance in CD-FSS evidencing the need to rethink approaches for the task.

    "abstract": "We address the problem of regressing 3D human pose and shape from a single image with a focus on 3D accuracy. The current best methods leverage large datasets of 3D pseudo-ground-truth (p-GT) and 2D keypoints leading to robust performance. With such methods however we observe a paradoxical decline in 3D pose accuracy with increasing 2D accuracy. This is caused by biases in the p-GT and the use of an approximate camera projection model. We quantify the error induced by current camera models and show that fitting 2D keypoints and p-GT accurately causes incorrect 3D poses. Our analysis defines the invalid distances within which minimizing 2D and p-GT losses is detrimental. We use this to formulate a new loss \"Threshold-Adaptive Loss Scaling\" (TALS) that penalizes gross 2D and p-GT errors but not smaller ones. With such a loss there are many 3D poses that could equally explain the 2D evidence. To reduce this ambiguity we need a prior over valid human poses but such priors can introduce unwanted bias. To address this we exploit a tokenized representation of human pose and reformulate the problem as token prediction. This restricts the estimated poses to the space of valid poses effectively improving robustness to occlusion. Extensive experiments on the EMDB and 3DPW datasets show that our reformulated loss and tokenization allows us to train on in-the-wild data while improving 3D accuracy over the state-of-the-art.

    "abstract": "Parameter-efficient fine-tuning for pre-trained Vision Transformers aims to adeptly tailor a model to downstream tasks by learning a minimal set of new adaptation parameters while preserving the frozen majority of pre-trained parameters. Striking a balance between retaining the generalizable representation capacity of the pre-trained model and acquiring task-specific features poses a key challenge. Currently there is a lack of focus on guiding this delicate trade-off. In this study we approach the problem from the perspective of Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) of pre-trained parameter matrices providing insights into the tuning dynamics of existing methods. Building upon this understanding we propose a Residual-based Low-Rank Rescaling (RLRR) fine-tuning strategy. This strategy not only enhances flexibility in parameter tuning but also ensures that new parameters do not deviate excessively from the pre-trained model through a residual design. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves competitive performance across various downstream image classification tasks all while maintaining comparable new parameters. We believe this work takes a step forward in offering a unified perspective for interpreting existing methods and serves as motivation for the development of new approaches that move closer to effectively considering the crucial trade-off mentioned above.

    "abstract": "Lifelong person re-identification (LReID) suffers from the catastrophic forgetting problem when learning from non-stationary data. Existing exemplar-based and knowledge distillation-based LReID methods encounter data privacy and limited acquisition capacity respectively. In this paper we instead introduce the prototype which is under-investigated in LReID to better balance knowledge forgetting and acquisition. Existing prototype-based works primarily focus on the classification task where the prototypes are set as discrete points or statistical distributions. However they either discard the distribution information or omit instance-level diversity which are crucial fine-grained clues for LReID. To address the above problems we propose Distribution-aware Knowledge Prototyping (DKP) where the instance-level diversity of each sample is modeled to transfer comprehensive fine-grained knowledge for prototyping and facilitating LReID learning. Specifically an Instance-level Distribution Modeling network is proposed to capture the local diversity of each instance. Then the Distribution-oriented Prototype Generation algorithm transforms the instance-level diversity into identity-level distributions as prototypes which is further explored by the designed Prototype-based Knowledge Transfer module to enhance the knowledge anti-forgetting and acquisition capacity of the LReID model. Extensive experiments verify that our method achieves superior plasticity and stability balancing and outperforms existing LReID methods by 8.1%/9.1% average mAP/R@1 improvement.

    "abstract": "The recent progress in language-based open-vocabulary object detection can be largely attributed to finding better ways of leveraging large-scale data with free-form text annotations. Training such models with a discriminative objective function has proven successful but requires good positive and negative samples. However the free-form nature and the open vocabulary of object descriptions make the space of negatives extremely large. Prior works randomly sample negatives or use rule-based techniques to build them. In contrast we propose to leverage the vast knowledge built into modern generative models to automatically build negatives that are more relevant to the original data. Specifically we use large-language-models to generate negative text descriptions and text-to-image diffusion models to also generate corresponding negative images. Our experimental analysis confirms the relevance of the generated negative data and its use in language-based detectors improves performance on two complex benchmarks.

    "abstract": "In precision agriculture the detection and recognition of insects play an essential role in the ability of crops to grow healthy and produce a high-quality yield. The current machine vision model requires a large volume of data to achieve high performance. However there are approximately 5.5 million different insect species in the world. None of the existing insect datasets can cover even a fraction of them due to varying geographic locations and acquisition costs. In this paper we introduce a novel \"Insect-1M\" dataset a game-changing resource poised to revolutionize insect-related foundation model training. Covering a vast spectrum of insect species our dataset including 1 million images with dense identification labels of taxonomy hierarchy and insect descriptions offers a panoramic view of entomology enabling foundation models to comprehend visual and semantic information about insects like never before. Then to efficiently establish an Insect Foundation Model we develop a micro-feature self-supervised learning method with a Patch-wise Relevant Attention mechanism capable of discerning the subtle differences among insect images. In addition we introduce Description Consistency loss to improve micro-feature modeling via insect descriptions. Through our experiments we illustrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach in insect modeling and achieve State-of-the-Art performance on standard benchmarks of insect-related tasks. Our Insect Foundation Model and Dataset promise to empower the next generation of insect-related vision models bringing them closer to the ultimate goal of precision agriculture",

The most powerful models in this space have been trained using massive datasets of paired inputs and large-scale computational resources making them prohibitively expensive to train in many practical scenarios.

We therefore propose FuseMix a multimodal augmentation scheme that operates on the latent spaces of arbitrary pre-trained unimodal encoders. Using FuseMix for multimodal alignment we achieve competitive performance - and in certain cases outperform state-of-the art methods - in both image-text and audio-text retrieval with orders of magnitude less compute and data: for example we outperform CLIP on the Flickr30K text-to-image retrieval task with ?600x fewer GPU days and ?80x fewer image-text pairs.

Existing PFL methods usually decouple global updates in deep neural networks by performing personalization on particular layers (i.e. classifier heads) and global aggregation for the rest of the network. However preselecting network layers for personalization may result in suboptimal storage of global knowledge. In this work we propose FedSelect a novel PFL algorithm inspired by the iterative subnetwork discovery procedure used for the Lottery Ticket Hypothesis. FedSelect incrementally expands subnetworks to personalize client parameters concurrently conducting global aggregations on the remaining parameters. This approach enables the personalization of both client parameters and subnetwork structure during the training process.

    "abstract": "3D facial landmark localization has proven to be of particular use for applications such as face tracking 3D face modeling and image-based 3D face reconstruction. In the supervised learning case such methods usually rely on 3D landmark datasets derived from 3DMM-based registration that often lack spatial definition alignment as compared with that chosen by hand-labeled human consensus e.g. how are eyebrow landmarks defined? This creates a gap between landmark datasets generated via high-quality 2D human labels and 3DMMs and it ultimately limits their effectiveness. To address this issue we introduce a novel semi-supervised learning approach that learns 3D landmarks by directly lifting (visible) hand-labeled 2D landmarks and ensures better definition alignment without the need for 3D landmark datasets. To lift 2D landmarks to 3D we leverage 3D-aware GANs for better multi-view consistency learning and in-the-wild multi-frame videos for robust cross-generalization. Empirical experiments demonstrate that our method not only achieves better definition alignment between 2D-3D landmarks but also outperforms other supervised learning 3D landmark localization methods on both 3DMM labeled and photogrammetric ground truth evaluation datasets.

    "abstract": "Image-level Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation (WSSS) has received increasing attention due to its low annotation cost. Class Activation Mapping (CAM) generated through classifier weights in WSSS inevitably ignores certain useful cues while the CAM generated through class prototypes can alleviate that. However because of the different goals of image classification and semantic segmentation the class prototypes still focus on activating primary discriminative pixels learned from classification loss leading to incomplete CAM. In this paper we propose a plugand-play Prototype-based Secondary Discriminative Pixels Mining (PSDPM) framework for enabling class prototypes to activate more secondary discriminative pixels thus generating a more complete CAM. Specifically we introduce a Foreground Pixel Estimation Module (FPEM) for estimating potential foreground pixels based on the correlations between primary and secondary discriminative pixels and the semantic segmentation results of baseline methods. Then we enable WSSS model to learn discriminative features from secondary discriminative pixels through a consistency loss calculated between FPEM result and class-prototype CAM. Experimental results show that our PSDPM improves various baseline methods significantly and achieves new state-of-the-art performances on WSSS benchmarks.

To better explore the common degradation representations from spatially-varying rain streaks we incorporate intra-scale implicit neural representations based on pixel coordinates with the degraded inputs in a closed-loop design enabling the learned features to facilitate rain removal and improve the robustness of the model in complex scenarios.

Specifically the frozen CLIP model is applied as the backbone for semantic feature extraction and a new decoder is designed to interpret extracted semantic features for final prediction. Meanwhile we utilize the above frozen backbone to generate pseudo labels for training the decoder. Such labels cannot be optimized during training.

    "abstract": "Personalized Federated Learning (PFL) is primarily designed to provide customized models for each client to better fit the non-iid distributed client data which is a inherent challenge in Federated Learning. However current PFL methods suffer from inconsistencies in both intra-client and inter-client levels: 1) The intra-client inconsistency stems from the asynchronous update strategy for personalized and shared parameters. In PFL clients update their shared parameters to communicate and learn from others while keeping personalized parts unchanged leading to poor coordination between these two components. 2) The Inter-client inconsistency arises from \"stragglers\" - inactive clients that communicate and train with the server less frequently. This results in their under-trained personalized models and impedes the collaborative training stage for other clients. In this paper we present a novel PFL framework named FedAS which uses Federated Parameter-Alignment and Client-Synchronization to overcome above challenges. Initially we enhance the localization of global parameters by infusing them with local insights. We make the shared parts learn from previous model thereby increasing their local relevance and reducing the impact of parameter inconsistency. Furthermore we design a robust aggregation method to mitigate the impact of stragglers by preventing the incorporation of their under-trained knowledge into aggregated model. Experimental results on Cifar10 and Cifar100 validate the effectiveness of our FedAS in achieving better performance and robustness against data heterogeneity",

Firstly compared with existing labelled face datasets a vastly larger magnitude of unlabeled faces exists in the real world. We explore the learning strategy of these unlabeled facial images through self-supervised pretraining to transfer generalized face recognition performance. Moreover motivated by one recent finding that is the face saliency area is critical for face recognition in contrast to utilizing random cropped blocks of images for constructing augmentations in pretraining we utilize patches localized by extracted facial landmarks. This enables our method - namely Landmark-based Facial Self-supervised learning (LAFS) to learn key representation that is more critical for face recognition. We also incorporate two landmark-specific augmentations which introduce more diversity of landmark information to further regularize the learning. With learned landmark-based facial representations we further adapt the representation for face recognition with regularization mitigating variations in landmark positions.

Most existing methods explore utilizing pre-trained vision-language models in which the key is to adopt the image-level model for pixel-level segmentation task. In this paper we propose a simple encoder-decoder named SED for open-vocabulary semantic segmentation which comprises a hierarchical encoder-based cost map generation and a gradual fusion decoder with category early rejection. The hierarchical encoder-based cost map generation employs hierarchical backbone instead of plain transformer to predict pixel-level image-text cost map. Compared to plain transformer hierarchical backbone better captures local spatial information and has linear computational complexity with respect to input size. Our gradual fusion decoder employs a top-down structure to combine cost map and the feature maps of different backbone levels for segmentation. To accelerate inference speed we introduce a category early rejection scheme in the decoder that rejects many no-existing categories at the early layer of decoder resulting in at most 4.7 times acceleration without accuracy degradation. Experiments are performed on multiple open-vocabulary semantic segmentation datasets which demonstrates the efficacy of our SED method. When using ConvNeXt-B our SED method achieves mIoU score of 31.6% on ADE20K with 150 categories at 82 millisecond (ms) per image on a single A6000.

In this paper we propose a simple yet effective method to mitigate this bias and enhance the quality of compressed images. Our method employs a conditional discriminator with the compressed image as a key condition and then incorporates a domain-divergence regularization to actively distance the enhancement domain from the compression domain.

    "abstract": "Humans live in a 3D world and commonly use natural language to interact with a 3D scene. Modeling a 3D language field to support open-ended language queries in 3D has gained increasing attention recently. This paper introduces LangSplat which constructs a 3D language field that enables precise and efficient open-vocabulary querying within 3D spaces. Unlike existing methods that ground CLIP language embeddings in a NeRF model LangSplat advances the field by utilizing a collection of 3D Gaussians each encoding language features distilled from CLIP to represent the language field. By employing a tile-based splatting technique for rendering language features we circumvent the costly rendering process inherent in NeRF. Instead of directly learning CLIP embeddings LangSplat first trains a scene-wise language autoencoder and then learns language features on the scene-specific latent space thereby alleviating substantial memory demands imposed by explicit modeling. Existing methods struggle with imprecise and vague 3D language fields which fail to discern clear boundaries between objects. We delve into this issue and propose to learn hierarchical semantics using SAM thereby eliminating the need for extensively querying the language field across various scales and the regularization of DINO features. Extensive experimental results show that LangSplat significantly outperforms the previous state-of-the-art method LERF by a large margin. Notably LangSplat is extremely efficient achieving a 199 x speedup compared to LERF at the resolution of 1440 x 1080.

This symbolic representation is a high-level abstraction of the real world which may render the motion prediction model vulnerable to perception errors (e.g. failures in detecting open-vocabulary obstacles) while missing salient information from the scene context (e.g. poor road conditions). An alternative paradigm is end-to-end learning from raw sensors. However this approach suffers from the lack of interpretability and requires significantly more training resources. In this work we propose tokenizing the visual world into a compact set of scene elements and then leveraging pre-trained image foundation models and LiDAR neural networks to encode all the scene elements in an open-vocabulary manner. The image foundation model enables our scene tokens to encode the general knowledge of the open world while the LiDAR neural network encodes geometry information. Our proposed representation can efficiently encode the multi-frame multi-modality observations with a few hundred tokens and is compatible with most transformer-based architectures.

    "abstract": "Planet-scale image geolocalization remains a challenging problem due to the diversity of images originating from anywhere in the world. Although approaches based on vision transformers have made significant progress in geolocalization accuracy success in prior literature is constrained to narrow distributions of images of landmarks and performance has not generalized to unseen places. We present a new geolocalization system that combines semantic geocell creation multi-task contrastive pretraining and a novel loss function. Additionally our work is the first to perform retrieval over location clusters for guess refinements. We train two models for evaluations on street-level data and general-purpose image geolocalization; the first model PIGEON is trained on data from the game of GeoGuessr and is capable of placing over 40% of its guesses within 25 kilometers of the target location globally. We also develop a bot and deploy PIGEON in a blind experiment against humans ranking in the top 0.01% of players. We further challenge one of the world's foremost professional GeoGuessr players to a series of six matches with millions of viewers winning all six games. Our second model PIGEOTTO differs in that it is trained on a dataset of images from Flickr and Wikipedia achieving state-of-the-art results on a wide range of image geolocalization benchmarks outperforming the previous SOTA by up to 7.7 percentage points on the city accuracy level and up to 38.8 percentage points on the country level. Our findings suggest that PIGEOTTO is the first image geolocalization model that effectively generalizes to unseen places and that our approach can pave the way for highly accurate planet-scale image geolocalization systems.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "How to effectively utilize the spectral and spatial characteristics of Hyperspectral Image (HSI) is always a key problem in spectral snapshot reconstruction. Recently the spectra-wise transformer has shown great potential in capturing inter-spectra similarities of HSI but the classic design of the transformer i.e. multi-head division in the spectral (channel) dimension hinders the modeling of global spectral information and results in mean effect. In addition previous methods adopt the normal spatial priors without taking imaging processes into account and fail to address the unique spatial degradation in snapshot spectral reconstruction. In this paper we analyze the influence of multi-head division and propose a novel Spectral-Spatial Rectification (SSR) method to enhance the utilization of spectral information and improve spatial degradation. Specifically SSR includes two core parts: Window-based Spectra-wise Self-Attention (WSSA) and spAtial Rectification Block (ARB). WSSA is proposed to capture global spectral information and account for local differences whereas ARB aims to mitigate the spatial degradation using a spatial alignment strategy. The experimental results on simulation and real scenes demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed modules and we also provide models at multiple scales to demonstrate the superiority of our approach",

    "abstract": "Text-to-image generation has witnessed significant progress with the advent of diffusion models. Despite the ability to generate photorealistic images current text-to-image diffusion models still often struggle to accurately interpret and follow complex input text prompts. In contrast to existing models that aim to generate images only with their best effort we introduce Self-correcting LLM-controlled Diffusion (SLD). SLD is a framework that generates an image from the input prompt assesses its alignment with the prompt and performs self-corrections on the inaccuracies in the generated image. Steered by an LLM controller SLD turns text-to-image generation into an iterative closed-loop process ensuring correctness in the resulting image. SLD is not only training-free but can also be seamlessly integrated with diffusion models behind API access such as DALL-E 3 to further boost the performance of state-of-the-art diffusion models. Experimental results show that our approach can rectify a majority of incorrect generations particularly in generative numeracy attribute binding and spatial relationships. Furthermore by simply adjusting the instructions to the LLM SLD can perform image editing tasks bridging the gap between text-to-image generation and image editing pipelines.

    "abstract": "We address the challenge of content diversity and controllability in pedestrian simulation for driving scenarios. Recent pedestrian animation frameworks have a significant limitation wherein they primarily focus on either following trajectory or the content of the reference video consequently overlooking the potential diversity of human motion within such scenarios. This limitation restricts the ability to generate pedestrian behaviors that exhibit a wider range of variations and realistic motions and therefore restricts its usage to provide rich motion content for other components in the driving simulation system e.g. suddenly changed motion to which the autonomous vehicle should respond. In our approach we strive to surpass the limitation by showcasing diverse human motions obtained from various sources such as generated human motions in addition to following the given trajectory. The fundamental contribution of our framework lies in combining the motion tracking task with trajectory following which enables the tracking of specific motion parts (e.g. upper body) while simultaneously following the given trajectory by a single policy. This way we significantly enhance both the diversity of simulated human motion within the given scenario and the controllability of the content including language-based control. Our framework facilitates the generation of a wide range of human motions contributing to greater realism and adaptability in pedestrian simulations for driving scenarios",

We assume that each data point has an associated confidence score that reflects the quality of the conditional information. We then condition the diffusion model on both the conditional information and the confidence score. In this way the model learns to ignore or discount the conditioning when the confidence is low.

However autonomous vehicles and robots in-the-wild require constant re-calibration due to exposure to various environmental factors including vibration and structural stress when cameras are arranged in a wide-baseline configuration. Conventional rectification methods fail in these challenging scenarios: especially for larger vehicles such as autonomous freight trucks and semi-trucks the resulting incorrect rectification severely affects the quality of downstream tasks that use stereo/multi-view data. To tackle these challenges we propose an online rectification approach that operates at real-time rates while achieving high accuracy. We propose a novel learning-based online calibration approach that utilizes stereo correlation volumes built from a feature representation obtained from cross-image attention. Our model is trained to minimize vertical optical flow as proxy rectification constraint and predicts the relative rotation between the stereo pair.

This paper introduces DNGaussian a depth-regularized framework based on 3D Gaussian radiance fields offering real-time and high-quality few-shot novel view synthesis at low costs. Our motivation stems from the highly efficient representation and surprising quality of the recent 3D Gaussian Splatting despite it will encounter a geometry degradation when input views decrease. In the Gaussian radiance fields we find this degradation in scene geometry primarily lined to the positioning of Gaussian primitives and can be mitigated by depth constraint. Consequently we propose a Hard and Soft Depth Regularization to restore accurate scene geometry under coarse monocular depth supervision while maintaining a fine-grained color appearance. To further refine detailed geometry reshaping we introduce Global-Local Depth Normalization enhancing the focus on small local depth changes. Extensive experiments on LLFF DTU and Blender datasets demonstrate that DNGaussian outperforms state-of-the-art methods achieving comparable or better results with significantly reduced memory cost a 25x reduction in training time and over 3000x faster rendering speed.

To tackle with this issue we present a novel strategy from the view of shadow transformation in this paper: directly homogenizing the spatial distribution of shadow degradation. Our key design is the random shuffle operation and its corresponding inverse operation. Specifically random shuffle operation stochastically rearranges the pixels across spatial space and the inverse operation recovers the original order. After randomly shuffling the shadow diffuses in the whole image and the degradation appears in a homogenized way which can be effectively processed by the local self-attention layer.

    "abstract": "Driver's eye gaze holds a wealth of cognitive and intentional cues crucial for intelligent vehicles. Despite its significance research on in-vehicle gaze estimation remains limited due to the scarcity of comprehensive and well-annotated datasets in real driving scenarios. In this paper we present three novel elements to advance in-vehicle gaze research. Firstly we introduce IVGaze a pioneering dataset capturing in-vehicle gaze collected from 125 individuals and covering a large range of gaze and head within vehicles. Conventional gaze collection systems are inadequate for in-vehicle use. In this dataset we propose a new vision-based solution for in-vehicle gaze collection introducing a refined gaze target calibration method to tackle annotation challenges. Second our research focuses on in-vehicle gaze estimation leveraging the IVGaze. Images of in-vehicle faces often suffer from low resolution prompting our introduction of a gaze pyramid transformer that harnesses transformer-based multilevel features integration. Expanding upon this we introduce the dual-stream gaze pyramid transformer (GazeDPTR). Employing perspective transformation we rotate virtual cameras to normalize images utilizing camera pose to merge normalized and original images for accurate gaze estimation. GazeDPTR showcases state-of-the-art performance on the IVGaze dataset. Thirdly we explore a novel strategy for gaze zone classification by extending the GazeDPTR. A foundational tri-plane and project gaze onto these planes are newly defined. Leveraging both positional features from the projection points and visual attributes from images we achieve superior performance compared to relying solely on visual features thereby substantiating the advantage of gaze estimation.

Providing 2M bounding box annotations it covers eight distinct classes of traffic participants ranging from vehicles to pedestrians and micro-mobility. eTraM's utility has been assessed using state-of-the-art methods for traffic participant detection including RVT RED and YOLOv8. We quantitatively evaluate the ability of event-based models to generalize on nighttime and unseen scenes. Our findings substantiate the compelling potential of leveraging event cameras for traffic monitoring opening new avenues for research and application. eTraM is available at https://eventbasedvision.github.io/eTraM",

    "abstract": "Learning-based stereo matching techniques have made significant progress. However existing methods inevitably lose geometrical structure information during the feature channel generation process resulting in edge detail mismatches. In this paper the Motif Channel Attention Stereo Matching Network (MoCha-Stereo) is designed to address this problem. We provide the Motif Channel Correlation Volume (MCCV) to determine more accurate edge matching costs. MCCV is achieved by projecting motif channels which capture common geometric structures in feature channels onto feature maps and cost volumes. In addition edge variations in the reconstruction error map also affect details matching we propose the Reconstruction Error Motif Penalty (REMP) module to further refine the full-resolution disparity estimation. REMP integrates the frequency information of typical channel features from the reconstruction error. MoCha-Stereo ranks 1st on the KITTI-2015 and KITTI-2012 Reflective leaderboards. Our structure also shows excellent performance in Multi-View Stereo. Code is avaliable at https://github.com/ZYangChen/MoCha-Stereo",

To address this limitation we propose a lightweight and self-supervised approach Key frame-conditioned long video-LLM (Koala) that introduces learnable spatiotemporal queries to adapt pretrained vLLMs for generalizing to longer videos. Our approach introduces two new tokenizers that condition on visual tokens computed from sparse video key frames for understanding short and long video moments. We train our proposed approach on HowTo100M and demonstrate its effectiveness on zero-shot long video understanding benchmarks where it outperforms state-of-the-art large models by 3 - 6% in absolute accuracy across all tasks.

    "abstract": "Registration of point clouds collected from a pair of distant vehicles provides a comprehensive and accurate 3D view of the driving scenario which is vital for driving safety related applications yet existing literature suffers from the expensive pose label acquisition and the deficiency to generalize to new data distributions. In this paper we propose EYOC an unsupervised distant point cloud registration method that adapts to new point cloud distributions on the fly requiring no global pose labels. The core idea of EYOC is to train a feature extractor in a progressive fashion where in each round the feature extractor trained with near point cloud pairs can label slightly farther point cloud pairs enabling self-supervision on such far point cloud pairs. This process continues until the derived extractor can be used to register distant point clouds. Particularly to enable high-fidelity correspondence label generation we devise an effective spatial filtering scheme to select the most representative correspondences to register a point cloud pair and then utilize the aligned point clouds to discover more correct correspondences. Experiments show that EYOC can achieve comparable performance with state-of-the-art supervised methods at a lower training cost.

However they may still face limitations in effectively distinguishing between the most challenging OOD samples that are much like in-distribution (ID) data i.e. ID-like samples. To this end we propose a novel OOD detection framework that discovers ID-like outliers using CLIP from the vicinity space of the ID samples thus helping to identify these most challenging OOD samples. Then a prompt learning framework is proposed that utilizes the identified ID-like outliers to further leverage the capabilities of CLIP for OOD detection. Benefiting from the powerful CLIP we only need a small number of ID samples to learn the prompts of the model without exposing other auxiliary outlier datasets. By focusing on the most challenging ID-like OOD samples and elegantly exploiting the capabilities of CLIP our method achieves superior few-shot learning performance on various real-world image datasets (e.g. in 4-shot OOD detection on the ImageNet-1k dataset our method reduces the average FPR95 by 12.16% and improves the average AUROC by 2.76% compared to state-of-the-art methods)",

Our method does not require extensive training but instead leverages the motion prior of a large pretrained text-to-video diffusion model using a score-distillation loss to guide the placement of strokes. To promote natural and smooth motion and to better preserve the sketch's appearance we model the learned motion through two components.

To leverage the vast availability of satellite imagery for this task various works have applied deep neural networks for predicting multispectral images in photorealistic quality. However the important area of vegetation dynamics has not been thoroughly explored. Our study introduces GreenEarthNet the first dataset specifically designed for high-resolution vegetation forecasting and Contextformer a novel deep learning approach for predicting vegetation greenness from Sentinel 2 satellite images with fine resolution across Europe. Our multi-modal transformer model Contextformer leverages spatial context through a vision backbone and predicts the temporal dynamics on local context patches incorporating meteorological time series in a parameter-efficient manner. The GreenEarthNet dataset features a learned cloud mask and an appropriate evaluation scheme for vegetation modeling. It also maintains compatibility with the existing satellite imagery forecasting dataset EarthNet2021 enabling cross-dataset model comparisons. Our extensive qualitative and quantitative analyses reveal that our methods outperform a broad range of baseline techniques. This includes surpassing previous state-of-the-art models on EarthNet2021 as well as adapted models from time series forecasting and video prediction. To the best of our knowledge this work presents the first models for continental-scale vegetation modeling at fine resolution able to capture anomalies beyond the seasonal cycle thereby paving the way for predicting vegetation health and behaviour in response to climate variability and extremes.

When adopting diffusion models for image restoration the crucial challenge lies in how to preserve high-level image fidelity in the randomness diffusion process and generate accurate background structures and realistic texture details. In this paper we propose a general framework and develop a Diffusion Texture Prior Model (DTPM) for image restoration tasks. DTPM explicitly models high-quality texture details through the diffusion process rather than global contextual content. In phase one of the training stage we pre-train DTPM on approximately 55K high-quality image samples after which we freeze most of its parameters. In phase two we insert conditional guidance adapters into DTPM and equip it with an initial predictor thereby facilitating its rapid adaptation to downstream image restoration tasks. Our DTPM could mitigate the randomness of traditional diffusion models by utilizing encapsulated rich and diverse texture knowledge and background structural information provided by the initial predictor during the sampling process. Our comprehensive evaluations of five image restoration tasks demonstrate DTPM's superiority over existing regression and diffusion-based image restoration methods in perceptual quality and its exceptional generalization capabilities",

    "abstract": "Single RGB or LiDAR is the mainstream sensor for the challenging scene flow which relies heavily on visual features to match motion features. Compared with single modality existing methods adopt a fusion strategy to directly fuse the cross-modal complementary knowledge in motion space. However these direct fusion methods may suffer the modality gap due to the visual intrinsic heterogeneous nature between RGB and LiDAR thus deteriorating motion features. We discover that event has the homogeneous nature with RGB and LiDAR in both visual and motion spaces. In this work we bring the event as a bridge between RGB and LiDAR and propose a novel hierarchical visual-motion fusion framework for scene flow which explores a homogeneous space to fuse the cross-modal complementary knowledge for physical interpretation. In visual fusion we discover that event has a complementarity (relative v.s. absolute) in luminance space with RGB for high dynamic imaging and has a complementarity (local boundary v.s. global shape) in scene structure space with LiDAR for structure integrity. In motion fusion we figure out that RGB event and LiDAR are complementary (spatial-dense temporal-dense v.s. spatiotemporal-sparse) to each other in correlation space which motivates us to fuse their motion correlations for motion continuity. The proposed hierarchical fusion can explicitly fuse the multimodal knowledge to progressively improve scene flow from visual space to motion space.

Different from existing methods that consider cross-view and along-epipolar information independently EVE-NeRF conducts the view-epipolar feature aggregation in an entangled manner by injecting the scene-invariant appearance continuity and geometry consistency priors to the aggregation process. Our approach effectively mitigates the potential lack of inherent geometric and appearance constraint resulting from one-dimensional interactions thus further boosting the 3D representation generalizablity. EVE-NeRF attains state-of-the-art performance across various evaluation scenarios.

    "abstract": "The ability of large language models (LLMs) to process visual inputs has given rise to general-purpose vision systems unifying various vision-language (VL) tasks by instruction tuning. However due to the enormous diversity in input-output formats in the vision domain existing general-purpose models fail to successfully integrate segmentation and multi-image inputs with coarse-level tasks into a single framework. In this work we introduce VistaLLM a powerful visual system that addresses coarse- and fine grained VL tasks over single and multiple input images using a unified framework. VistaLLM utilizes an instruction-guided image tokenizer that filters global embeddings using task descriptions to extract compressed and refined features from numerous images. Moreover VistaLLM employs a gradient-aware adaptive sampling technique to represent binary segmentation masks as sequences significantly improving over previously used uniform sampling. To bolster the desired capability of VistaLLM we curate CoinIt a comprehensive coarse-to-fine instruction tuning dataset with 6.8M samples. We also address the lack of multi-image grounding datasets by introducing a novel task AttCoSeg (Attribute-level Co Segmentation) which boosts the model's reasoning and grounding capability over multiple input images. Extensive experiments on a wide range of V- and VL tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of VistaLLM by achieving consistent state-of-the-art performance over strong baselines across many downstream tasks.

There is still a lack of a vision-pressure multimodal dataset with large-range and fast human motion as well as accurate and dense foot-contact annotation. To fill this gap we propose a Multimodal MoCap Dataset with Vision and Pressure sensors named MMVP. MMVP provides accurate and dense plantar pressure signals synchronized with RGBD observations which is especially useful for both plausible shape estimation robust pose fitting without foot drifting and accurate global translation tracking. To validate the dataset we propose an RGBD-P SMPL fitting method and also a monocular-video-based baseline framework VP-MoCap for human motion capture. Experiments demonstrate that our RGBD-P SMPL Fitting results significantly outperform pure visual motion capture. Moreover VP-MoCap outperforms SOTA methods in foot-contact and global translation estimation accuracy.

The existing VINS algorithms with either high accuracy or low computational complexity are difficult to provide the high precision localization in resource-constrained devices. To this end we propose a novel filter-based VINS framework named SchurVINS (SV) which could guarantee both high accuracy by building a complete residual model and low computational complexity with Schur complement. Technically we first formulate the full residual model where Gradient Hessian and observation covariance are explicitly modeled. Then Schur complement is employed to decompose the full model into ego-motion residual model and landmark residual model.

    "abstract": "Domain Generalized Semantic Segmentation (DGSS) deals with training a model on a labeled source domain with the aim of generalizing to unseen domains during inference. Existing DGSS methods typically effectuate robust features by means of Domain Randomization (DR). Such an approach is often limited as it can only account for style diversification and not content. In this work we take an orthogonal approach to DGSS and propose to use an assembly of CoLlaborative FOUndation models for Domain Generalized Semantic Segmentation (CLOUDS). In detail CLOUDS is a framework that integrates Foundation Models of various kinds: (i) CLIP backbone for its robust feature representation (ii) Diffusion Model to diversify the content thereby covering various modes of the possible target distribution and (iii) Segment Anything Model (SAM) for iteratively refining the predictions of the segmentation model. Extensive experiments show that our CLOUDS excels in adapting from synthetic to real DGSS benchmarks and under varying weather conditions notably outperforming prior methods by 5.6% and 6.7% on averaged mIoU respectively.

    "abstract": "This paper addresses the problem of generating lifelike holistic co-speech motions for 3D avatars focusing on two key aspects: variability and coordination. Variability allows the avatar to exhibit a wide range of motions even with similar speech content while coordination ensures a harmonious alignment among facial expressions hand gestures and body poses. We aim to achieve both with ProbTalk a unified probabilistic framework designed to jointly model facial hand and body movements in speech. ProbTalk builds on the variational autoencoder (VAE) architecture and incorporates three core designs. First we introduce product quantization (PQ) to the VAE which enriches the representation of complex holistic motion. Second we devise a novel non-autoregressive model that embeds 2D positional encoding into the product-quantized representation thereby preserving essential structure information of the PQ codes. Last we employ a secondary stage to refine the preliminary prediction further sharpening the high-frequency details. Coupling these three designs enables ProbTalk to generate natural and diverse holistic co-speech motions outperforming several state-of-the-art methods in qualitative and quantitative evaluations particularly in terms of realism.

Current state-of-the-art methods train the labeled data with ground truths and unlabeled data with pseudo labels. However the two training flows are separate which allows labeled data to dominate the training process resulting in low-quality pseudo labels and consequently sub-optimal results. To alleviate this issue we present AllSpark which reborns the labeled features from unlabeled ones with the channel-wise cross-attention mechanism. We further introduce a Semantic Memory along with a Channel Semantic Grouping strategy to ensure that unlabeled features adequately represent labeled features. The AllSpark shed new light on the architecture level designs of SSSS rather than framework level which avoids increasingly complicated training pipeline designs. It can also be regarded as a flexible bottleneck module that can be seamlessly integrated into a general transformer-based segmentation model.

We propose SIGNeRF a novel approach for fast and controllable NeRF scene editing and scene-integrated object generation. A new generative update strategy ensures 3D consistency across the edited images without requiring iterative optimization. We find that depth-conditioned diffusion models inherently possess the capability to generate 3D consistent views by requesting a grid of images instead of single views. Based on these insights we introduce a multi-view reference sheet of modified images. Our method updates an image collection consistently based on the reference sheet and refines the original NeRF with the newly generated image set in one go. By exploiting the depth conditioning mechanism of the image diffusion model we gain fine control over the spatial location of the edit and enforce shape guidance by a selected region or an external mesh",

Towards this end we propose OVER-NAV which aims to go over and beyond the current arts of IVLN techniques.

Such a mechanism introduces reliable cross-modal supervision and enables on-the-fly generalization to unseen scenes without the need of extra annotation and re-training. To fully exploit the interpreted navigation data we further introduce a structured representation coded Omnigraph to effectively integrate multi-modal information along the tour.

While private computing environments (e.g. secure enclaves) and cryptographic approaches (e.g. homomorphic encryption) provide strong privacy protection their computing performance still falls short compared to cloud GPUs. To achieve privacy protection with high computing performance we propose Delta a new private training and inference framework with comparable model performance as non-private centralized training. Delta features two asymmetric data flows: the main information-sensitive flow and the residual flow. The main part flows into a small model while the residuals are offloaded to a large model. Specifically Delta embeds the information-sensitive representations into a low-dimensional space while pushing the information-insensitive part into high-dimension residuals. To ensure privacy protection the low-dimensional information-sensitive part is secured and fed to a small model in a private environment. On the other hand the residual part is sent to fast cloud GPUs and processed by a large model. To further enhance privacy and reduce the communication cost Delta applies a random binary quantization technique along with a DP-based technique to the residuals before sharing them with the public platform. We theoretically show that Delta guarantees differential privacy in the public environment and greatly reduces the complexity in the private environment. We conduct empirical analyses on CIFAR-10 CIFAR-100 and ImageNet datasets and ResNet-18 and ResNet-34 showing that Delta achieves strong privacy protection fast training and inference without significantly compromising the model utility",

Due to the unordered property of point clouds LiDAR scans typically show varying geometric structures across different regions in terms of density noises etc hence leading to increased dynamics on context. However such characteristics are not consistent across domains due to the difference in sensors environments etc thus hampering the effective scene comprehension across domains. To solve this we propose Cooperative Context Learning that performs context modeling and modulation from different aspects but in a cooperative manner. Specifically we first devise context embeddings to discover and model contextual relationships with close neighbors in a learnable manner. Then with the context embeddings from two domains we introduce a set of learnable prototypes to attend and associate them under the attention paradigm. As a result these prototypes naturally establish long-range dependency across regions and domains thereby encouraging the transfer of context knowledge and easing the adaptation. Moreover the attention in turn attunes and guides the local context modeling and urges them to focus on the domain-invariant context knowledge thus promoting the adaptation in a cooperative manner.

To alleviate this issue we develop a novel training framework called Adversarial Frequency Mixup (AFM).

Subsequently incorporating these noisy images into the training pipeline enhances the denoising network's robustness to variations in noise distributions.

    "abstract": "This work proposes the first online asymmetric semi-supervised framework namely A-Teacher for LiDAR-based 3D object detection. Our motivation stems from the observation that 1) existing symmetric teacher-student methods for semi-supervised 3D object detection have characterized simplicity but impede the distillation performance between teacher and student because of the demand for an identical model structure and input data format. 2) The offline asymmetric methods with a complex teacher model constructed differently can generate more precise pseudo-labels but is challenging to jointly optimize the teacher and student model. Consequently in this paper we devise a different path from the conventional paradigm which can harness the capacity of a strong teacher while preserving the advantages of online teacher model updates. The essence is the proposed attention-based refinement model that can be seamlessly integrated into a vanilla teacher. The refinement model works in the divide-and-conquer manner that respectively handles three challenging scenarios including 1) objects detected in the current timestamp but with suboptimal box quality 2) objects are missed in the current timestamp but are detected in past or future frames 3) objects are neglected in all frames. It is worth noting that even while tackling these complex cases our model retains the efficiency of the online teacher-student semi-supervised framework.

However directly aggregating adjacent costs can lead to suboptimal results due to local geometric inconsistency. Related methods either seek selective aggregation or improve aggregated depth in the 2D space both are unable to handle geometric inconsistency in the cost volume effectively. In this paper we propose GoMVS to aggregate geometrically consistent costs yielding better utilization of adjacent geometries. More specifically we correspond and propagate adjacent costs to the reference pixel by leveraging the local geometric smoothness in conjunction with surface normals. We achieve this by the geometric consistent propagation (GCP) module. It computes the correspondence from the adjacent depth hypothesis space to the reference depth space using surface normals then uses the correspondence to propagate adjacent costs to the reference geometry followed by a convolution for aggregation.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Retrieval tasks play central roles in real-world machine learning systems such as search engines recommender systems and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). Achieving decent performance in these tasks often requires fine-tuning various pre-trained models on specific datasets and selecting the best candidate a process that can be both time and resource-consuming. To tackle the problem we introduce a novel and efficient method called RetMMD that leverages Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) and kernel methods to assess the transferability of pretrained models in retrieval tasks. RetMMD is calculated on pretrained model and target dataset without any fine-tuning involved. Specifically given some query we quantify the distribution discrepancy between relevant and irrelevant document embeddings by estimating the similarities within their mappings in the fine-tuned embedding space through kernel method. This discrepancy is averaged over multiple queries taking into account the distribution characteristics of the target dataset. Experiments suggest that the proposed metric calculated on pre-trained models closely aligns with retrieval performance post-fine-tuning. The observation holds across a variety of datasets including image text and multi-modal domains indicating the potential of using MMD and kernel methods for transfer learning evaluation in retrieval scenarios. In addition we also design a way of evaluating dataset transferability for retrieval tasks with experimental results demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed approach",

Among various applications the task of customizing diverse scenes for user-specified composited elements holds great application value but has not been extensively explored. Addressing this gap we propose AnyScene a specialized framework designed to create varied scenes from composited foreground using textual prompts. AnyScene addresses the primary challenges inherent in existing methods particularly scene disharmony due to a lack of foreground semantic understanding and distortion of foreground elements. Specifically we develop a foreground injection module that guides a pre-trained diffusion model to generate cohesive scenes in visual harmony with the provided foreground. To enhance robust generation we implement a layout control strategy that prevents distortions of foreground elements. Furthermore an efficient image blending mechanism seamlessly reintegrates foreground details into the generated scenes producing outputs with overall visual harmony and precise foreground details. In addition we propose a new benchmark and a series of quantitative metrics to evaluate this proposed image customization task.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Super-resolution (SR) is an ill-posed inverse problem where the size of the set of feasible solutions that are consistent with a given low-resolution image is very large. Many algorithms have been proposed to find a \"good\" solution among the feasible solutions that strike a balance between fidelity and perceptual quality. Unfortunately all known methods generate artifacts and hallucinations while trying to reconstruct high-frequency (HF) image details. A fundamental question is: Can a model learn to distinguish genuine image details from artifacts? Although some recent works focused on the differentiation of details and artifacts this is a very challenging problem and a satisfactory solution is yet to be found. This paper shows that the characterization of genuine HF details versus artifacts can be better learned by training GAN-based SR models using wavelet-domain loss functions compared to RGB-domain or Fourier-space losses. Although wavelet-domain losses have been used in the literature before they have not been used in the context of the SR task. More specifically we train the discriminator only on the HF wavelet sub-bands instead of on RGB images and the generator is trained by a fidelity loss over wavelet subbands to make it sensitive to the scale and orientation of structures. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our model achieves better perception-distortion trade-off according to multiple objective measures and visual evaluations",

    "abstract": "Creating personalized hand avatars is important to offer a realistic experience to users on AR / VR platforms. While most prior studies focused on reconstructing 3D hand shapes some recent work has tackled the reconstruction of hand textures on top of shapes. However these methods are often limited to capturing pixels on the visible side of a hand requiring diverse views of the hand in a video or multiple images as input. In this paper we propose a novel method BiTT(Bi-directional Texture reconstruction of Two hands) which is the first end-to-end train- able method for relightable pose-free texture reconstruction of two interacting hands taking only a single RGB image by three novel components: 1) bi-directional (left ? right) texture reconstruction using the texture symmetry of left / right hands 2) utilizing a texture parametric model for hand texture recovery and 3) the overall coarse-to-fine stage pipeline for reconstructing personalized texture of two interacting hands. BiTT first estimates the scene light condition and albedo image from an input image then reconstructs the texture of both hands through the texture parametric model and bi-directional texture reconstructor. In experiments using InterHand2.6M and RGB2Hands datasets our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art hand texture reconstruction methods quantitatively and qualitatively.

In this paper we introduce DetCLIPv3 a high-performing detector that excels not only at both open-vocabulary object detection but also generating hierarchical labels for detected objects. DetCLIPv3 is characterized by three core designs: 1. Versatile model architecture: we derive a robust open-set detection framework which is further empowered with generation ability via the integration of a caption head. 2. High information density data: we develop an auto-annotation pipeline leveraging visual large language model to refine captions for large-scale image-text pairs providing rich multi-granular object labels to enhance the training. 3. Efficient training strategy: we employ a pre-training stage with low-resolution inputs that enables the object captioner to efficiently learn a broad spectrum of visual concepts from extensive image-text paired data. This is followed by a fine-tuning stage that leverages a small number of high-resolution samples to further enhance detection performance. With these effective designs DetCLIPv3 demonstrates superior open-vocabulary detection performance e.g. our Swin-T backbone model achieves a notable 47.0 zero-shot fixed AP on the LVIS minival benchmark outperforming GLIPv2 GroundingDINO and DetCLIPv2 by 18.0/19.6/6.6 AP respectively.

Thus we constructed the first large-scale high-resolution underwater video enhancement benchmark (UVEB) to promote the development of underwater vision.It contains 1308 pairs of video sequences and more than 453000 high-resolution with 38% Ultra-High-Definition (UHD) 4K frame pairs.

    "abstract": "Recent 3D face reconstruction methods have made remarkable advancements yet there remain huge challenges in monocular high-quality facial reflectance reconstruction. Existing methods rely on a large amount of light-stage captured data to learn facial reflectance models. However the lack of subject diversity poses challenges in achieving good generalization and widespread applicability. In this paper we learn the reflectance prior in image space rather than UV space and present a framework named ID2Reflectance. Our framework can directly estimate the reflectance maps of a single image while using limited reflectance data for training. Our key insight is that reflectance data shares facial structures with RGB faces which enables obtaining expressive facial prior from inexpensive RGB data thus reducing the dependency on reflectance data. We first learn a high-quality prior for facial reflectance. Specifically we pretrain multi-domain facial feature codebooks and design a codebook fusion method to align the reflectance and RGB domains. Then we propose an identity-conditioned swapping module that injects facial identity from the target image into the pre-trained auto-encoder to modify the identity of the source reflectance image. Finally we stitch multi-view swapped reflectance images to obtain renderable assets. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method exhibits excellent generalization capability and achieves state-of-the-art facial reflectance reconstruction results for in-the-wild faces",

The novelty of the proposed model is threefold. First we introduce an approach to weight tokens based on motion gradients thus shifting the focus from the static background scene to the foreground objects. Second we integrate a teacher decoder and a student decoder into our architecture leveraging the discrepancy between the outputs given by the two decoders to improve anomaly detection. Third we generate synthetic abnormal events to augment the training videos and task the masked AE model to jointly reconstruct the original frames (without anomalies) and the corresponding pixel-level anomaly maps. Our design leads to an efficient and effective model as demonstrated by the extensive experiments carried out on four benchmarks: Avenue ShanghaiTech UBnormal and UCSD Ped2. The empirical results show that our model achieves an excellent trade-off between speed and accuracy obtaining competitive AUC scores while processing 1655 FPS.

While diffusion models have been successful their computational intensity has prompted the pursuit of more efficient alternatives. As a representative work non-autoregressive Transformers (NATs) have been recognized for their rapid generation. However a major drawback of these models is their inferior performance compared to diffusion models. In this paper we aim to re-evaluate the full potential of NATs by revisiting the design of their training and inference strategies. Specifically we identify the complexities in properly configuring these strategies and indicate the possible sub-optimality in existing heuristic-driven designs. Recognizing this we propose to go beyond existing methods by directly solving the optimal strategies in an automatic framework. The resulting method named AutoNAT advances the performance boundaries of NATs notably and is able to perform comparably with the latest diffusion models with a significantly reduced inference cost. The effectiveness of AutoNAT is comprehensively validated on four benchmark datasets i.e. ImageNet-256 & 512 MS-COCO and CC3M.

In this paper we explore the benefits of incorporating depth observations in the reconstruction process by introducing ANIM a novel method that reconstructs arbitrary 3D human shapes from single-view RGB-D images with an unprecedented level of accuracy. Our model learns geometric details from both multi-resolution pixel-aligned and voxel-aligned features to leverage depth information and enable spatial relationships mitigating depth ambiguities. We further enhance the quality of the reconstructed shape by introducing a depth-supervision strategy which improves the accuracy of the signed distance field estimation of points that lie on the reconstructed surface. Experiments demonstrate that ANIM outperforms state-of-the-art works that use RGB surface normals point cloud or RGB-D data as input.

    "abstract": "We present SimXR a method for controlling a simulated avatar from information (headset pose and cameras) obtained from AR / VR headsets. Due to the challenging viewpoint of head-mounted cameras the human body is often clipped out of view making traditional image-based egocentric pose estimation challenging. On the other hand headset poses provide valuable information about overall body motion but lack fine-grained details about the hands and feet. To synergize headset poses with cameras we control a humanoid to track headset movement while analyzing input images to decide body movement. When body parts are seen the movements of hands and feet will be guided by the images; when unseen the laws of physics guide the controller to generate plausible motion. We design an end-to-end method that does not rely on any intermediate representations and learns to directly map from images and headset poses to humanoid control signals. To train our method we also propose a large-scale synthetic dataset created using camera configurations compatible with a commercially available VR headset (Quest 2) and show promising results on real-world captures. To demonstrate the applicability of our framework we also test it on an AR headset with a forward-facing camera",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Recently Vision-Language Model (VLM) has greatly advanced the Human-Object Interaction (HOI) detection. The existing VLM-based HOI detectors typically adopt a hand-crafted template (e.g. a photo of a person [action] a/an [object]) to acquire text knowledge through the VLM text encoder. However such approaches only encoding the action-specific text prompts in vocabulary level may suffer from learning ambiguity without exploring the fine-grained clues from the perspective of interaction context. In this paper we propose a novel method to discover Syntactic Interaction Clues for HOI detection (SICHOI) by using VLM. Specifically we first investigate what are the essential elements for an interaction context and then establish a syntactic interaction bank from three levels: spatial relationship action-oriented posture and situational condition. Further to align visual features with the syntactic interaction bank we adopt a multi-view extractor to jointly aggregate visual features from instance interaction and image levels accordingly. In addition we also introduce a dual cross-attention decoder to perform context propagation between text knowledge and visual features thereby enhancing the HOI detection. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance on HICO-DET and V-COCO",

    "abstract": "We study supervised action segmentation whose goal is to predict framewise action labels of a video. To capture temporal dependencies over long horizons prior works either improve framewise features with transformer or refine framewise predictions with learned action features. However they are computationally costly and ignore that frame and action features contain complimentary information which can be leveraged to enhance both features and improve temporal modeling. Therefore we propose an efficient Frame-Action Cross-attention Temporal modeling (FACT) framework that performs temporal modeling with frame and action features in parallel and leverage this parallelism to achieve iterative bidirectional information transfer between the features and refine them. FACT network contains (i) a frame branch to learn frame-level information with convolutions and frame features (ii) an action branch to learn action-level dependencies with transformers and action tokens and (iii) cross-attentions to allow communication between the two branches. We also propose a new matching loss to ensure each action token uniquely encodes an action segment thus better captures its semantics. Thanks to our architecture we can also leverage textual transcripts of videos to help action segmentation. We evaluate FACT on four video datasets (two egocentric and two third-person) for action segmentation with and without transcripts showing that it significantly improves the state-of-the-art accuracy while enjoys lower computational cost (3 times faster) than existing transformer-based methods",

    "abstract": "Zero-Shot Temporal Action Localization (ZS-TAL) seeks to identify and locate actions in untrimmed videos unseen during training. Existing ZS-TAL methods involve fine-tuning a model on a large amount of annotated training data. While effective training-based ZS-TAL approaches assume the availability of labeled data for supervised learning which can be impractical in some applications. Furthermore the training process naturally induces a domain bias into the learned model which may adversely affect the model's generalization ability to arbitrary videos. These considerations prompt us to approach the ZS-TAL problem from a radically novel perspective relaxing the requirement for training data. To this aim we introduce a novel method that performs Test-Time adaptation for Temporal Action Localization (T3AL). In a nutshell T3AL adapts a pre-trained Vision and Language Model (VLM). T3AL operates in three steps. First a video-level pseudo-label of the action category is computed by aggregating information from the entire video. Then action localization is performed adopting a novel procedure inspired by self-supervised learning. Finally frame-level textual descriptions extracted with a state-of-the-art captioning model are employed for refining the action region proposals. We validate the effectiveness of T 3AL by conducting experiments on the THUMOS14 and the ActivityNet-v1.3 datasets. Our results demonstrate that T3AL significantly outperforms zero-shot baselines based on state-of-the-art VLMs confirming the benefit of a test-time adaptation approach",

Additionally in pursuit of the most hardware-efficient backbone we evaluated numerous architectures in our multi-teacher distillation pipeline using the same training recipe. This led to the development of a novel architecture (E-RADIO) that exceeds the performance of its predecessors and is at least 6x faster than the teacher models at matched resolution.

    "abstract": "Open-vocabulary 3D instance segmentation is cutting-edge for its ability to segment 3D instances without predefined categories. However progress in 3D lags behind its 2D counterpart due to limited annotated 3D data. To address this recent works first generate 2D open-vocabulary masks through 2D models and then merge them into 3D instances based on metrics calculated between two neighboring frames. In contrast to these local metrics we propose a novel metric view consensus rate to enhance the utilization of multi-view observations. The key insight is that two 2D masks should be deemed part of the same 3D instance if a significant number of other 2D masks from different views contain both these two masks. Using this metric as edge weight we construct a global mask graph where each mask is a node. Through iterative clustering of masks showing high view consensus we generate a series of clusters each representing a distinct 3D instance. Notably our model is training-free. Through extensive experiments on publicly available datasets including ScanNet++ ScanNet200 and MatterPort3D we demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in open-vocabulary 3D instance segmentation.

While prior works have focused on generating motion guided by text music or scenes these typically result in isolated motions confined to short durations.

In this context we introduce FlowMDM the first diffusion-based model that generates seamless Human Motion Compositions (HMC) without any postprocessing or redundant denoising steps. For this we introduce the Blended Positional Encodings a technique that leverages both absolute and relative positional encodings in the denoising chain. More specifically global motion coherence is recovered at the absolute stage whereas smooth and realistic transitions are built at the relative stage. As a result we achieve state-of-the-art results in terms of accuracy realism and smoothness on the Babel and HumanML3D datasets. FlowMDM excels when trained with only a single description per motion sequence thanks to its Pose-Centric Cross-ATtention which makes it robust against varying text descriptions at inference time. Finally to address the limitations of existing HMC metrics we propose two new metrics: the Peak Jerk and the Area Under the Jerk to detect abrupt transitions",

    "abstract": "Adversarial robustness of the neural network is a significant concern when it is applied to security-critical domains. In this situation adversarial distillation is a promising option which aims to distill the robustness of the teacher network to improve the robustness of a small student network. Previous works pretrain the teacher network to make it robust against the adversarial examples aimed at itself. However the adversarial examples are dependent on the parameters of the target network. The fixed teacher network inevitably degrades its robustness against the unseen transferred adversarial examples which target the parameters of the student network in the adversarial distillation process. We propose PeerAiD to make a peer network learn the adversarial examples of the student network instead of adversarial examples aimed at itself. PeerAiD is an adversarial distillation that trains the peer network and the student network simultaneously in order to specialize the peer network for defending the student network. We observe that such peer networks surpass the robustness of the pretrained robust teacher model against adversarial examples aimed at the student network. With this peer network and adversarial distillation PeerAiD achieves significantly higher robustness of the student network with AutoAttack (AA) accuracy by up to 1.66%p and improves the natural accuracy of the student network by up to 4.72%p with ResNet-18 on TinyImageNet dataset.

    "abstract": "Vision-language models (VLMs) are trained for thousands of GPU hours on carefully selected subsets of massive web scrapes. For instance the LAION public dataset retained only about 10 percent of the total crawled data. In recent times data curation has gained prominence with several works developing strategies to retain high-quality subsets of raw scraped data. However these strategies are typically developed agnostic to the available compute for training. In this paper we demonstrate that making filtering decisions independent of training compute is often suboptimal: well-curated data rapidly loses its utility when repeated eventually decreasing below the utility of unseen but lower-quality data. While past research in neural scaling laws has considered web data to be homogenous real data is not. Our work bridges this important gap in the literature by developing scaling laws that characterize the differing utility of various data subsets and accounting for how this diminishes for a data point at its nth repetition. Our key message is that data curation can not be agnostic of the total compute a model will be trained for. Even without ever jointly training on multiple data buckets our scaling laws enable us to estimate model performance under this dynamic trade-off between quality and repetition. This allows us to curate the best possible pool for achieving top performance on Datacomp at various compute budgets carving out a pareto-frontier for data curation",

However its properties have not been well understood. So we present the first study that introduces graph signal processing into the domain of correspondence graph. We exploit the generalized degree signal on correspondence graph and pursue sampling strategies that preserve high-frequency components of this signal. To address time-consuming singular value decomposition in deterministic sampling we resort to a stochastic approximate sampling strategy. As such the core of our method is the stochastic spectral sampling of correspondence graph. As an application we build a complete 3D registration algorithm termed as FastMAC that reaches real-time speed while leading to little to none performance drop. Through extensive experiments we validate that FastMAC works for both indoor and outdoor benchmarks.

Recent work has shown this is due to the final layer of the network being most prone to local bias some finding success freezing the final layer as an orthogonal classifier. We investigate the training dynamics of the classifier by applying SVD to the weights motivated by the observation that freezing weights results in constant singular values. We find that there are differences when training in IID and non-IID settings. Based on this finding we introduce two regularization terms for local training to continuously emulate IID settings: (1) variance in the dimension-wise probability distribution of the classifier and (2) hyperspherical uniformity of representations of the encoder. These regularizations promote local models to act as if it were in an IID setting regardless of the local data distribution thus offsetting proneness to bias while being flexible to the data. On extensive experiments in both label-shift and feature-shift settings we verify that our method achieves highest performance by a large margin especially in highly non-IID cases in addition to being scalable to larger models and datasets",

    "abstract": "Federated Learning (FL) aggregates locally trained models from individual clients to construct a global model. While FL enables learning a model with data privacy it often suffers from significant performance degradation when clients have heterogeneous data distributions. This data heterogeneity causes the model to forget the global knowledge acquired from previously sampled clients after being trained on local datasets. Although the introduction of proximal objectives in local updates helps to preserve global knowledge it can also hinder local learning by interfering with local objectives. Inspired by Continual Learning (CL) we adopt an orthogonal learning strategy to balance these two conflicting objectives. However we observe that directly negating the proximal gradient in the local gradient significantly undermines local learning. To address the problem we propose a novel method Federated Stabilized Orthogonal Learning (FedSOL). FedSOL is designed to identify gradients of local objectives that are inherently orthogonal to directions affecting the proximal objective. Specifically FedSOL targets parameter regions where learning on the local objective is minimally influenced by proximal weight perturbations.

In this paper we seek to leverage Gaussian splatting to generate realistic animatable avatars from textual descriptions addressing the limitations (e.g. efficiency and flexibility) imposed by mesh or NeRF-based representations. However a naive application of Gaussian splatting cannot generate high-quality animatable avatars and suffers from learning instability; it also cannot capture fine avatar geometries and often leads to degenerate body parts. To tackle these problems we first propose a primitive-based 3D Gaussian representation where Gaussians are defined inside pose-driven primitives to facilitate animations. Second to stabilize and amortize the learning of millions of Gaussians we propose to use implicit neural fields to predict the Gaussian attributes (e.g. colors). Finally to capture fine avatar geometries and extract detailed meshes we propose a novel SDF-based implicit mesh learning approach for 3D Gaussians that regularizes the underlying geometries and extracts highly detailed textured meshes. Our proposed method GAvatar enables the large-scale generation of diverse animatable avatars using only text prompts.

    "abstract": "Understanding how attention varies across individuals has significant scientific and societal impacts. However existing visual scanpath models treat attention uniformly neglecting individual differences. To bridge this gap this paper focuses on individualized scanpath prediction (ISP) a new attention modeling task that aims to accurately predict how different individuals shift their attention in diverse visual tasks. It proposes an ISP method featuring three novel technical components: (1) an observer encoder to characterize and integrate an observer's unique attention traits (2) an observer-centric feature integration approach that holistically combines visual features task guidance and observer-specific characteristics and (3) an adaptive fixation prioritization mechanism that refines scanpath predictions by dynamically prioritizing semantic feature maps based on individual observers' attention traits. These novel components allow scanpath models to effectively address the attention variations across different observers. Our method is generally applicable to different datasets model architectures and visual tasks offering a comprehensive tool for transforming general scanpath models into individualized ones. Comprehensive evaluations using value-based and ranking-based metrics verify the method's effectiveness and generalizability",

    "abstract": "This paper presents a novel category agnostic model for visual rearrangement task which can help an embodied agent to physically recover the shuffled scene configuration without any category concepts to the goal configuration. Previous methods usually follow a similar architecture completing the rearrangement task by aligning the scene changes of the goal and shuffled configuration according to the semantic scene graphs. However constructing scene graphs requires the inference of category labels which not only causes the accuracy drop of the entire task but also limits the application in real world scenario. In this paper we delve deep into the essence of visual rearrangement task and focus on the two most essential issues scene change detection and scene change matching. We utilize the movement and the protrusion of point cloud to accurately identify the scene changes and match these changes depending on the similarity of category agnostic appearance feature. Moreover to assist the agent to explore the environment more efficiently and comprehensively we propose a closer-aligned-retrace exploration policy aiming to observe more details of the scene at a closer distance. We conduct extensive experiments on AI2THOR Rearrangement Challenge based on RoomR dataset and a new multi-room multi-instance dataset MrMiR collected by us.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Vision-language foundation models have shown remarkable performance in various zero-shot settings such as image retrieval classification or captioning. But so far those models seem to fall behind when it comes to zero-shot localization of referential expressions and objects in images. As a result they need to be fine-tuned for this task. In this paper we show that pretrained vision-language (VL) models allow for zero-shot open-vocabulary object localization without any fine-tuning. To leverage those capabilities we propose a Grounding Everything Module (GEM) that generalizes the idea of value-value attention introduced by CLIPSurgery to a self-self attention path. We show that the concept of self-self attention corresponds to clustering thus enforcing groups of tokens arising from the same object to be similar while preserving the alignment with the language space. To further guide the group formation we propose a set of regularizations that allows the model to finally generalize across datasets and backbones. We evaluate the proposed GEM framework on various benchmark tasks and datasets for semantic segmentation. GEM not only outperforms other training-free open-vocabulary localization methods but also achieves state-of-the-art results on the recently proposed OpenImagesV7 large-scale segmentation benchmark.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "We focus on a very challenging task: imaging at nighttime dynamic scenes. Most previous methods rely on the low-light enhancement of a conventional RGB camera. However they would inevitably face a dilemma between the long exposure time of nighttime and the motion blur of dynamic scenes. Event cameras react to dynamic changes with higher temporal resolution (microsecond) and higher dynamic range (120dB) offering an alternative solution. In this work we present a novel nighttime dynamic imaging method with an event camera. Specifically we discover that the event at nighttime exhibits temporal trailing characteristics and spatial non-stationary distribution. Consequently we propose a nighttime event reconstruction network (NER-Net) which mainly includes a learnable event timestamps calibration module (LETC) to align the temporal trailing events and a non-uniform illumination aware module (NIAM) to stabilize the spatiotemporal distribution of events. Moreover we construct a paired real low-light event dataset (RLED) through a co-axial imaging system including 64200 spatially and temporally aligned image GTs and low-light events. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of visual quality and generalization ability on real-world nighttime datasets.

To overcome this limitation we introduce Adam-v2 a new self-supervised learning framework extending Adam [68] by explicitly incorporating part-whole hierarchies into its learning objectives through three key branches: (1) Localizability acquiring discriminative representations to distinguish different anatomical patterns; (2) Composability learning each anatomical structure in a parts-to-whole manner; and (3) Decomposability comprehending each anatomical structure in a whole-to-parts manner. Experimental results across 10 tasks compared to 11 baselines in zero-shot few-shot transfer and full fine-tuning settings showcase Adam-v2's superior performance over large-scale medical models and existing SSL methods across diverse downstream tasks. The higher generality and robustness of Adam-v2's representations originate from its explicit construction of hierarchies for distinct anatomical structures from unlabeled medical images. Adam-v2 preserves a semantic balance of anatomical diversity and harmony in its embedding yielding representations that are both generic and semantically meaningful yet overlooked in existing SSL methods.

Though prior studies have achieved very promising performance they involve intensive computation which is severely unaligned with test-time adaptation. We design TDA a training-free dynamic adapter that enables effective and efficient test-time adaptation with vision-language models. TDA works with a lightweight key-value cache that maintains a dynamic queue with few-shot pseudo labels as values and the corresponding test-sample features as keys. Leveraging the key-value cache TDA allows adapting to test data gradually via progressive pseudo label refinement which is super-efficient without incurring any backpropagation. In addition we introduce negative pseudo labeling that alleviates the adverse impact of pseudo label noises by assigning pseudo labels to certain negative classes when the model is uncertain about its pseudo label predictions. Extensive experiments over two benchmarks demonstrate TDA's superior effectiveness and efficiency as compared with the state-of-the-art. The code has been released in https://kdiaaa.github.io/tda/",

    "abstract": "Is vision good enough for language? Recent advancements in multimodal models primarily stem from the powerful reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs). However the visual component typically depends only on the instance-level contrastive language-image pre-training (CLIP). Our research reveals that the visual capabilities in recent MultiModal LLMs (MLLMs) still exhibit systematic shortcomings. To understand the roots of these errors we explore the gap between the visual embedding space of CLIP and vision-only self-supervised learning. We identify \"CLIP-blind pairs\" - images that CLIP perceives as similar despite their clear visual differences. With these pairs we construct the Multimodal Visual Patterns (MMVP) benchmark. MMVP exposes areas where state-of-the-art systems including GPT-4V struggle with straightforward questions across nine basic visual patterns often providing incorrect answers and hallucinated explanations. We further evaluate various CLIP-based vision-and-language models and found a notable correlation between visual patterns that challenge CLIP models and those problematic for multimodal LLMs. As an initial effort to address these issues we propose a Mixture of Features (MoF) approach demonstrating that integrating vision self-supervised learning features with MLLMs can significantly enhance their visual grounding capabilities.

In this paper we propose a novel Domain Separation Graph Neural Network (DSGNN) which starts with separately extracting the shape and texture cues from each object and builds an shape graph as well as a texture graph for all objects in the given image. Then we propose a Shape-Texture Graph Domain Separation (STGDS) module to separate the task-relevant and irrelevant information of target objects by explicitly modelling the relationship between each pair of objects in terms of their shapes and textures respectively. Furthermore a Cross Image Graph Domain Separation (CIGDS) module is introduced to explore the saliency degree subspace that is robust to different scenes aiming to create a unified representation for targets with the same saliency levels in different images. Importantly our DSGNN automatically learns a multi-dimensional feature to represent each graph edge allowing complex diverse and ranking-related relationships to be modelled. Experimental results show that our DSGNN achieved the new state-of-the-art performance on both ASSR and IRSR datasets with large improvements of 5.2% and 4.1% SA-SOR respectively.

However these methods struggle to simultaneously capture high-frequency information in edges and low-frequency information in smooth regions due to the fixed receptive field. As a result they tend to lose details blur edges and produce false matches in textureless areas. In this paper we propose Selective Recurrent Unit (SRU) a novel iterative update operator for stereo matching. The SRU module can adaptively fuse hidden disparity information at multiple frequencies for edge and smooth regions. To perform adaptive fusion we introduce a new Contextual Spatial Attention (CSA) module to generate attention maps as fusion weights. The SRU empowers the network to aggregate hidden disparity information across multiple frequencies mitigating the risk of vital hidden disparity information loss during iterative processes. To verify SRU's universality we apply it to representative iterative stereo matching methods collectively referred to as Selective-Stereo.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Personalized Federated Learning (pFL) has emerged as a promising solution to tackle data heterogeneity across clients in FL. However existing pFL methods either (1) introduce high computation and communication costs or (2) overfit to local data which can be limited in scope and vulnerable to evolved test samples with natural distribution shifts. In this paper we propose PerAda a parameter-efficient pFL framework that reduces communication and computational costs and exhibits superior generalization performance especially under test-time distribution shifts. PerAda reduces the costs by leveraging the power of pretrained models and only updates and communicates a small number of additional parameters from adapters. PerAda achieves high generalization by regularizing each client's personalized adapter with a global adapter while the global adapter uses knowledge distillation to aggregate generalized information from all clients. Theoretically we provide generalization bounds of PerAda and we prove its convergence to stationary points under non-convex settings. Empirically PerAda demonstrates higher personalized performance (+4.85% on CheXpert) and enables better out-of-distribution generalization (+5.23% on CIFAR-10-C) on different datasets across natural and medical domains compared with baselines while only updating 12.6% of parameters per model.

The presence of false negatives can impede achieving optimal performance and even lead to a significant performance drop. To address this challenge we propose MAFA (MAnaging FAlse nega- tives) which consists of two pivotal components building upon the recently developed GRouped mIni-baTch sampling (GRIT) strategy: 1) an efficient connection mining process that identifies and converts false negatives into positives and 2) label smoothing for the image-text contrastive (ITC) loss. Our comprehensive experiments verify the effectiveness of MAFA across multiple downstream tasks emphasizing the crucial role of addressing false negatives in VLP potentially even surpassing the importance of addressing false posi- tives.

To address the entanglement challenge when using full garment images as conditions we develop a two-stage pipeline with explicit disentanglement of style and texture. In the first stage we generate a human parsing map reflecting the desired style conditioned on the input. In the second stage we composite textures onto the parsing map areas based on the texture input. To represent complex and non-stationary textures that have never been achieved in previous fashion editing works we first propose extracting hierarchical and balanced CLIP features and applying position encoding in VTON.

    "abstract": "Continual learning requires the model to learn multiple tasks sequentially. In continual learning the model should possess the ability to maintain its performance on old tasks (stability) and the ability to adapt to new tasks continuously (plasticity). Recently parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) which involves freezing a pre-trained model and injecting a small number of learnable parameters to adapt to downstream tasks has gained increasing popularity in continual learning. Although existing continual learning methods based on PEFT have demonstrated superior performance compared to those not based on PEFT most of them do not consider how to eliminate the interference of the new task on the old tasks which inhibits the model from making a good trade-off between stability and plasticity. In this work we propose a new PEFT method called interference-free low-rank adaptation (InfLoRA) for continual learning. InfLoRA injects a small number of parameters to reparameterize the pre-trained weights and shows that fine-tuning these injected parameters is equivalent to fine-tuning the pre-trained weights within a subspace. Furthermore InfLoRA designs this subspace to eliminate the interference of the new task on the old tasks making a good trade-off between stability and plasticity.

    "abstract": "3D pose transfer that aims to transfer the desired pose to a target mesh is one of the most challenging 3D generation tasks. Previous attempts rely on well-defined parametric human models or skeletal joints as driving pose sources. However to obtain those clean pose sources cumbersome but necessary pre-processing pipelines are inevitable hindering implementations of the real-time applications. This work is driven by the intuition that the robustness of the model can be enhanced by introducing adversarial samples into the training leading to a more invulnerable model to the noisy inputs which even can be further extended to directly handling the real-world data like raw point clouds/scans without intermediate processing. Furthermore we propose a novel 3D pose Masked Autoencoder (3D-PoseMAE) a customized MAE that effectively learns 3D extrinsic presentations (i.e. pose). 3D-PoseMAE facilitates learning from the aspect of extrinsic attributes by simultaneously generating adversarial samples that perturb the model and learning the arbitrary raw noisy poses via a multi-scale masking strategy. Both qualitative and quantitative studies show that the transferred meshes given by our network result in much better quality. Besides we demonstrate the strong generalizability of our method on various poses different domains and even raw scans. Experimental results also show meaningful insights that the intermediate adversarial samples generated in the training can successfully attack the existing pose transfer models",

Among them leveraging self-supervised Vision Transformers for unsupervised semantic segmentation (USS) has been making steady progress with expressive deep features. Yet for semantically segmenting images with complex objects a predominant challenge remains: the lack of explicit object-level semantic encoding in patch-level features. This technical limitation often leads to inadequate segmentation of complex objects with diverse structures. To address this gap we present a novel approach EAGLE which emphasizes object-centric representation learning for unsupervised semantic segmentation. Specifically we introduce EiCue a spectral technique providing semantic and structural cues through an eigenbasis derived from the semantic similarity matrix of deep image features and color affinity from an image. Further by incorporating our object-centric contrastive loss with EiCue we guide our model to learn object-level representations with intra- and inter-image object-feature consistency thereby enhancing semantic accuracy.

Given a video a masked region at its initial frame and an editing prompt it requires a model to do infilling at each frame following the editing guidance while keeping the out-of-mask region intact. There are three main challenges in text-guided video inpainting: (i) temporal consistency of the edited video (ii) supporting different inpainting types at different structural fidelity levels and (iii) dealing with variable video length. To address these challenges we introduce Any-Length Video Inpainting with Diffusion Model dubbed as AVID. At its core our model is equipped with effective motion modules and adjustable structure guidance for fixed-length video inpainting. Building on top of that we propose a novel Temporal MultiDiffusion sampling pipeline with a middle-frame attention guidance mechanism facilitating the generation of videos with any desired duration.

The current layout-aware text-to-image diffusion models still have several issues including mismatches between the text and layout conditions and quality degradation of generated images. This paper proposes a novel layout-aware text-to-image diffusion model called NoiseCollage to tackle these issues. During the denoising process NoiseCollage independently estimates noises for individual objects and then crops and merges them into a single noise. This operation helps avoid condition mismatches; in other words it can put the right objects in the right places. Qualitative and quantitative evaluations show that NoiseCollage outperforms several state-of-the-art models. These successful results indicate that the crop-and-merge operation of noises is a reasonable strategy to control image generation. We also show that NoiseCollage can be integrated with ControlNet to use edges sketches and pose skeletons as additional conditions. Experimental results show that this integration boosts the layout accuracy of ControlNet. The code is available at https://github.com/univ-esuty/noisecollage",

Our framework comprises three key components: knowledge distillation a sample purification module and an exploration and knowledge retention mechanism. First given sequential image frames we pseudo-label the data and estimate uncertainty using an ensemble of inverse dynamics models. The uncertainty is used to select the most informative samples to add to an experience replay buffer. We specifically select high-uncertainty pseudo-labels to facilitate the exploration and learning of new and diverse driving skills. However in contrast to prior work in continual learning that assumes ground-truth labeled samples the uncertain pseudo-labels can introduce significant noise. Thus we also pair the exploration with a label refinement module which makes use of consistency constraints to re-label the noisy exploratory samples and effectively learn from diverse data.

    "abstract": "Neural implicit scene representations have recently shown encouraging results in dense visual SLAM. However existing methods produce low-quality scene reconstruction and low-accuracy localization performance when scaling up to large indoor scenes and long sequences. These limitations are mainly due to their single global radiance field with finite capacity which does not adapt to large scenarios. Their end-to-end pose networks are also not robust enough with the growth of cumulative errors in large scenes. To this end we introduce PLGSLAM a neural visual SLAM system capable of high-fidelity surface reconstruction and robust camera tracking in real-time. To handle large-scale indoor scenes PLGSLAM proposes a progressive scene representation method which dynamically allocates new local scene representation trained with frames within a local sliding window. This allows us to scale up to larger indoor scenes and improves robustness (even under pose drifts). In local scene representation PLGSLAM utilizes tri-planes for local high-frequency features with multi-layer perceptron (MLP) networks for the low-frequency feature achieving smoothness and scene completion in unobserved areas. Moreover we propose local-to-global bundle adjustment method with a global keyframe database to address the increased pose drifts on long sequences. Experimental results demonstrate that PLGSLAM achieves state-of-the-art scene reconstruction results and tracking performance across various datasets and scenarios (both in small and large-scale indoor environments)",

In this paper we present a novel decoder-focused method for multi-task dense prediction called Mixture-of-Low-Rank-Experts (MLoRE). To model the global task relationships MLoRE adds a generic convolution path to the original MoE structure where each task feature can go through this path for explicit parameter sharing. Furthermore to control the parameters and computational cost brought by the increase in the number of experts we take inspiration from LoRA and propose to leverage the low-rank format of a vanilla convolution in the expert network. Since the low-rank experts have fewer parameters and can be dynamically parameterized into the generic convolution the parameters and computational cost do not change much with the increase of experts. Benefiting from this design we increase the number of experts and its reception field to enlarge the representation capacity facilitating multiple dense tasks learning in a unified network. Extensive experiments on the PASCAL-Context and NYUD-v2 benchmarks show that our MLoRE achieves superior performance compared to previous state-of-the-art methods on all metrics.

In response our paper introduces the Attribute-Guided Pedestrian Retrieval (AGPR) task focusing on integrating specified attributes with query images to refine retrieval results. Although there has been progress in attribute-driven image retrieval there remains a notable gap in effectively blending robust Re-ID models with intra-class attribute variations. To bridge this gap we present the Attribute-Guided Transformer-based Pedestrian Retrieval (ATPR) framework. ATPR adeptly merges global ID recognition with local attribute learning ensuring a cohesive linkage between the two. Furthermore to effectively handle the complexity of attribute interconnectivity ATPR organizes attributes into distinct groups and applies both inter-group correlation and intra-group decorrelation regularizations. Our extensive experiments on a newly established benchmark using the RAP dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of ATPR within the AGPR paradigm",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "The increasing prevalence of video clips has sparked growing interest in text-video retrieval. Recent advances focus on establishing a joint embedding space for text and video relying on consistent embedding representations to compute similarity. However the text content in existing datasets is generally short and concise making it hard to fully describe the redundant semantics of a video. Correspondingly a single text embedding may be less expressive to capture the video embedding and empower the retrieval. In this study we propose a new stochastic text modeling method T-MASS i.e. text is modeled as a stochastic embedding to enrich text embedding with a flexible and resilient semantic range yielding a text mass. To be specific we introduce a similarity-aware radius module to adapt the scale of the text mass upon the given text-video pairs. Plus we design and develop a support text regularization to further control the text mass during the training. The inference pipeline is also tailored to fully exploit the text mass for accurate retrieval. Empirical evidence suggests that T-MASS not only effectively attracts relevant text-video pairs while distancing irrelevant ones but also enables the determination of precise text embeddings for relevant pairs. Our experimental results show a substantial improvement of T-MASS over baseline (3% 6.3% by R@1). Also T-MASS achieves state-of-the-art performance on five benchmark datasets including MSRVTT LSMDC DiDeMo VATEX and Charades",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Recently non-transferable learning (NTL) was proposed to restrict models' generalization toward the target domain(s) which serves as state-of-the-art solutions for intellectual property (IP) protection. However the robustness of the established \"transferability barrier\" for degrading the target domain performance has not been well studied. In this paper we first show that the generalization performance of NTL models is widely impaired on third-party domains (i.e. the unseen domain in the NTL training stage). We explore the impairment patterns and find that: due to the dominant generalization of non-transferable task NTL models tend to make target-domain-consistent predictions on third-party domains even though only a slight distribution shift from the third-party domain to the source domain. Motivated by these findings we uncover the potential risks of NTL by proposing a simple but effective method (dubbed as TransNTL) to recover the target domain performance with few source domain data. Specifically by performing a group of different perturbations on the few source domain data we obtain diverse third-party domains that evoke the same impairment patterns as the unavailable target domain. Then we fine-tune the NTL model under an impairment-repair self-distillation framework where the source-domain predictions are used to teach the model itself how to predict on third-party domains thus repairing the impaired generalization. Empirically experiments on standard NTL benchmarks show that the proposed TransNTL reaches up to 72% target-domain improvements by using only 10% source domain data. Finally we also explore a feasible defense method and empirically demonstrate its effectiveness",

    "abstract": "Computer animation's quest to bridge content and style has historically been a challenging venture with previous efforts often leaning toward one at the expense of the other. This paper tackles the inherent challenge of content-style duality ensuring a harmonious fusion where the core narrative of the content is both preserved and elevated through stylistic enhancements. We propose a novel Multi-condition Motion Latent Diffusion Model (MCM-LDM) for Arbitrary Motion Style Transfer (AMST). Our MCM-LDM significantly emphasizes preserving trajectories recognizing their fundamental role in defining the essence and fluidity of motion content. Our MCM-LDM's cornerstone lies in its ability first to disentangle and then intricately weave together motion's tripartite components: motion trajectory motion content and motion style. The critical insight of MCM-LDM is to embed multiple conditions with distinct priorities. The content channel serves as the primary flow guiding the overall structure and movement while the trajectory and style channels act as auxiliary components and synchronize with the primary one dynamically. This mechanism ensures that multi-conditions can seamlessly integrate into the main flow enhancing the overall animation without overshadowing the core content. Empirical evaluations underscore the model's proficiency in achieving fluid and authentic motion style transfers setting a new benchmark in the realm of computer animation.

While classical depth estimation methods infer only a 2.5D scene representation limited to the image plane recent approaches based on radiance fields reconstruct a full 3D representation. However these methods still struggle with occluded regions since inferring geometry without visual observation requires (i) semantic knowledge of the surroundings and (ii) reasoning about spatial context. We propose KYN a novel method for single-view scene reconstruction that reasons about semantic and spatial context to predict each point's density. We introduce a vision-language modulation module to enrich point features with fine-grained semantic information. We aggregate point representations across the scene through a language-guided spatial attention mechanism to yield per-point density predictions aware of the 3D semantic context. We show that KYN improves 3D shape recovery compared to predicting density for each 3D point in isolation.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Image enhancement algorithms have made remarkable advancements in recent years but directly applying them to Ultra-high-definition (UHD) images presents intractable computational overheads. Therefore previous straightforward solutions employ resampling techniques to reduce the resolution by adopting a \"Downsampling-Enhancement-Upsampling\" processing paradigm. However this paradigm disentangles the resampling operators and inner enhancement algorithms which results in the loss of information that is favored by the model further leading to sub-optimal outcomes. In this paper we propose a novel method of Learning Model-Aware Resampling (LMAR) which learns to customize resampling by extracting model-aware information from the UHD input image under the guidance of model knowledge. Specifically our method consists of two core designs namely compensatory kernel estimation and steganographic resampling. At the first stage we dynamically predict compensatory kernels tailored to the specific input and resampling scales. At the second stage the image-wise compensatory information is derived with the compensatory kernels and embedded into the rescaled input images. This promotes the representation of the newly derived downscaled inputs to be more consistent with the full-resolution UHD inputs as perceived by the model. Our LMAR enables model-aware and model-favored resampling while maintaining compatibility with existing resampling operators. Extensive experiments on multiple UHD image enhancement datasets and different backbones have shown consistent performance gains after correlating resizer and enhancer e.g. up to 1.2dB PSNR gain for x1.8 resampling scale on UHD-LOL4K.

Most existing studies are devoted to designing vision-specific transformers to solve the above problems which introduce additional pre-training costs. Therefore we present a plain pre-training-free and feature-enhanced ViT backbone with Convolutional Multi-scale feature interaction named ViT-CoMer which facilitates bidirectional interaction between CNN and transformer. Compared to the state-of-the-art ViT-CoMer has the following advantages: (1) We inject spatial pyramid multi-receptive field convolutional features into the ViT architecture which effectively alleviates the problems of limited local information interaction and single-feature representation in ViT. (2) We propose a simple and efficient CNN-Transformer bidirectional fusion interaction module that performs multi-scale fusion across hierarchical features which is beneficial for handling dense prediction tasks. (3) We evaluate the performance of ViT-CoMer across various dense prediction tasks different frameworks and multiple advanced pre-training. Notably our ViT-CoMer-L achieves 64.3% AP on COCO val2017 without extra training data and 62.1% mIoU on ADE20K val both of which are comparable to state-of-the-art methods.

    "abstract": "Diffusion-based generative models have exhibited remarkable capability in the production of high-fidelity visual content such as images and videos. However their performance is significantly contingent upon the quality of textual inputs commonly referred to as \"prompts\". The process of traditional prompt engineering while effective necessitates empirical expertise and poses challenges for inexperienced users. In this paper we introduce PromptCoT an innovative enhancer that autonomously refines prompts for users. PromptCoT is designed based on the observation that prompts which resemble the textual information of high-quality images in the training set often lead to superior generation performance. Therefore we fine-tune the pre-trained Large Language Models (LLM) using a curated text dataset that solely comprises descriptions of high-quality visual content. By doing so the LLM can capture the distribution of high-quality training texts enabling it to generate aligned continuations and revisions to boost the original texts. Nonetheless one drawback of pre-trained LLMs is their tendency to generate extraneous or irrelevant information. We employ the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) mechanism to improve the alignment between the original text prompts and their refined versions. CoT can extract and amalgamate crucial information from the aligned continuation and revision enabling reasonable inferences based on the contextual cues to produce a more comprehensive and nuanced final output. Considering computational efficiency instead of allocating a dedicated LLM for prompt enhancement to each individual model or dataset we integrate adapters that facilitate dataset-specific adaptation leveraging a shared pre-trained LLM as the foundation for this process. With independent fine-tuning of these adapters we can adapt PromptCoT to new datasets while minimally increasing training costs and memory usage. We evaluate the effectiveness of PromptCoT by assessing its performance on widely-used latent diffusion models for image and video generation.

However MLLMs still face a fundamental limitation of hallucinations where they tend to generate erroneous or fabricated information. In this paper we address hallucinations in MLLMs from a novel perspective of representation learning. We first analyzed the representation distribution of textual and visual tokens in MLLM revealing two important findings: 1) there is a significant gap between textual and visual representations indicating unsatisfactory cross-modal representation alignment; 2) representations of texts that contain and do not contain hallucinations are entangled making it challenging to distinguish them. These two observations inspire us with a simple yet effective method to mitigate hallucinations. Specifically we introduce contrastive learning into MLLMs and use text with hallucination as hard negative examples naturally bringing representations of non-hallucinative text and visual samples closer while pushing way representations of non-hallucinating and hallucinative text. We evaluate our method quantitatively and qualitatively showing its effectiveness in reducing hallucination occurrences and improving performance across multiple benchmarks.

However we identify that this set prediction paradigm encounters several optimization challenges in the field of dexterous grasping and results in restricted performance. To address these issues we propose progressive strategies for both the training and testing phases. First the dynamic-static matching training (DSMT) strategy is presented to enhance the optimization stability during the training phase. Second we introduce the adversarial-balanced test-time adaptation (AB-TTA) with a pair of adversarial losses to improve grasping quality during the testing phase. Experimental results on the DexGraspNet dataset demonstrate the capability of DGTR to predict dexterous grasp poses with both high quality and diversity.

For the first time our framework explores three types of bilateral entanglements within AVS: pixel entanglement modality entanglement and temporal entanglement. Regarding pixel entanglement we employ a Siam-Encoder Module (SEM) that leverages prior knowledge to generate more precise visual features from the foundational model. For modality entanglement we design a Bilateral-Fusion Module (BFM) enabling COMBO to align corresponding visual and auditory signals bi-directionally. As for temporal entanglement we introduce an innovative adaptive inter-frame consistency loss according to the inherent rules of temporal.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Vision-language models (VLMs) have recently shown promising results in traditional downstream tasks. Evaluation studies have emerged to assess their abilities with the majority focusing on the third-person perspective and only a few addressing specific tasks from the first-person perspective. However the capability of VLMs to \"think\" from a first-person perspective a crucial attribute for advancing autonomous agents and robotics remains largely unexplored. To bridge this research gap we introduce EgoThink a novel visual question-answering benchmark that encompasses six core capabilities with twelve detailed dimensions. The benchmark is constructed using selected clips from egocentric videos with manually annotated question-answer pairs containing first-person information. To comprehensively assess VLMs we evaluate twenty-one popular VLMs on EgoThink. Moreover given the open-ended format of the answers we use GPT-4 as the automatic judge to compute single-answer grading. Experimental results indicate that although GPT-4V leads in numerous dimensions all evaluated VLMs still possess considerable potential for improvement in first-person perspective tasks. Meanwhile enlarging the number of trainable parameters has the most significant impact on model performance on EgoThink. In conclusion EgoThink serves as a valuable addition to existing evaluation benchmarks for VLMs providing an indispensable resource for future research in the realm of embodied artificial intelligence and robotics",

However alongside immersive visual experiences immersive auditory experiences are equally vital to our holistic perception of an environment. In this paper we aim to reconstruct the spatial acoustic characteristics of an arbitrary environment given only a sparse set of (roughly 12) room impulse response (RIR) recordings and a planar reconstruction of the scene a setup that is easily achievable by ordinary users. To this end we introduce DiffRIR a differentiable RIR rendering framework with interpretable parametric models of salient acoustic features of the scene including sound source directivity and surface reflectivity. This allows us to synthesize novel auditory experiences through the space with any source audio. To evaluate our method we collect a dataset of RIR recordings and music in four diverse real environments. We show that our model outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on rendering monaural and binaural RIRs and music at unseen locations and learns physically interpretable parameters characterizing acoustic properties of the sound source and surfaces in the scene",

However prevailing depth estimation models grapple with accommodating the increasing resolutions commonplace in today's consumer cameras and devices.

We present PatchFusion a novel tile-based framework with three key components to improve the current state of the art: (1) A patch-wise fusion network that fuses a globally-consistent coarse prediction with finer inconsistent tiled predictions via high-level feature guidance (2) A Global-to-Local (G2L) module that adds vital context to the fusion network discarding the need for patch selection heuristics and (3) A Consistency-Aware Training (CAT) and Inference (CAI) approach emphasizing patch overlap consistency and thereby eradicating the necessity for post-processing. Experiments on UnrealStereo4K MVS-Synth and Middleburry 2014 demonstrate that our framework can generate high-resolution depth maps with intricate details. PatchFusion is independent of the base model for depth estimation.

However due to the diversity of frameworks there is no practical method to support high-level applications like 3D head avatar editing across different representations.

To achieve this goal we design a novel expression-aware modification generative model which enables lift 2D editing from a single image to a consistent 3D modification field. To ensure the effectiveness of the generative modification process we develop several techniques including an expression-dependent modification distillation scheme to draw knowledge from the large-scale head avatar model and 2D facial texture editing tools implicit latent space guidance to enhance model convergence and a segmentation-based loss reweight strategy for fine-grained texture inversion.

However we observe that when adopting CLIP to such a pixel-level understanding task unexpected bias occurs. Previous works don't explicitly model such bias which largely constrains the segmentation performance. In this paper we propose to explicitly model and rectify the bias existing in CLIP to facilitate the unsupervised semantic segmentation. Specifically we design a learnable \"Reference\" prompt to encode class-preference bias and project the positional embedding of vision transformer to represent space-preference bias. Via a simple element-wise subtraction we rectify the logits of CLIP classifier. Based on the rectified logits we generate a segmentation mask via a Gumbel-Softmax operation. Then a contrastive loss between masked visual feature and the text features of different classes is imposed to facilitate the effective bias modeling. To further improve the segmentation we distill the knowledge from the rectified CLIP to the advanced segmentation architecture via minimizing our designed mask-guided feature-guided and text-guided loss terms.

Our key insight is to perform unsupervised feature learning in hyperbolic instead of Euclidean space where the distance between points still reflects image similarity yet we gain additional capacity for representing prototypicality with the location of the point: The closer it is to the origin the more prototypical it is. The latter property is simply emergent from optimizing the metric learning objective: The image similar to many training instances is best placed at the center of corresponding points in Euclidean space but closer to the origin in hyperbolic space. We propose an unsupervised feature learning algorithm in Hyperbolic space with sphere pACKing. HACK first generates uniformly packed particles in the Poincar'e ball of hyperbolic space and then assigns each image uniquely to a particle. With our feature mapper simply trained to spread out training instances in hyperbolic space we observe that images move closer to the origin with congealing - a warping process that aligns all the images and makes them appear more common and similar to each other validating our idea of unsupervised prototypicality discovery. We demonstrate that our data-driven prototypicality provides an easy and superior unsupervised instance selection to reduce sample complexity increase model generalization with atypical instances and robustness with typical ones",

This allows generating diverse state trajectories that adhere to the learnable skills. By integrating skill learning with conditional trajectory generation SkillDiffuser produces coherent behavior following abstract instructions across diverse tasks.

This motivates us to study GZSL in the more practical setting where unseen classes can be either similar or dissimilar to seen classes. In this paper we propose a simple yet effective GZSL framework by exploring diverse semantics from external class names (DSECN) which is simultaneously robust on the similar and dissimilar unseen classes. This is achieved by introducing diverse semantics from external class names and aligning the introduced semantics to visual space using the classification head of pre-trained network. Furthermore we show that the design idea of DSECN can easily be integrate into other advanced GZSL approaches such as the generative-based ones and enhance their robustness for dissimilar unseen classes.

To overcome these challenges we present a novel framework dubbed TeMO to parse multi-object 3D scenes and edit their styles under the contrast supervision at multiple levels. We first propose a Decoupled Graph Attention (DGA) module to distinguishably reinforce the features of 3D surface points. Particularly a cross-modal graph is constructed to align the object points accurately and noun phrases decoupled from the 3D mesh and textual description. Then we develop a Cross-Grained Contrast (CGC) supervision system where a fine-grained loss between the words in the textual description and the randomly rendered images are constructed to complement the coarse-grained loss.

    "abstract": "Domain adaptation for object detection typically entails transferring knowledge from one visible domain to another visible domain. However there are limited studies on adapting from the visible to the thermal domain because the domain gap between the visible and thermal domains is much larger than expected and traditional domain adaptation can not successfully facilitate learning in this situation. To overcome this challenge we propose a Distinctive Dual-Domain Teacher (D3T) framework that employs distinct training paradigms for each domain. Specifically we segregate the source and target training sets for building dual-teachers and successively deploy exponential moving average to the student model to individual teachers of each domain. The framework further incorporates a zigzag learning method between dual teachers facilitating a gradual transition from the visible to thermal domains during training. We validate the superiority of our method through newly designed experimental protocols with well-known thermal datasets i.e. FLIR and KAIST.

Despite its straightforward nature as a binary classification task the currently best-performing PU algorithms still largely lag behind the supervised counterpart. In this work we identify that the primary bottleneck lies in the difficulty of deriving discriminative representations under unreliable binary supervision with poor semantics which subsequently hinders the common label disambiguation procedures. To cope with this problem we propose a novel PU learning framework namely Latent Group-Aware Meta Disambiguation (LaGAM) which incorporates a hierarchical contrastive learning module to extract the underlying grouping semantics within PU data and produce compact representations. As a result LaGAM enables a more aggressive label disambiguation strategy where we enhance the robustness of training by iteratively distilling the true labels of unlabeled data directly through meta-learning. Extensive experiments show that LaGAM significantly outperforms the current state-of-the-art methods by an average of 6.8% accuracy on common benchmarks approaching the supervised baseline.

    "abstract": "In this paper we introduce a new perspective for improving image restoration by removing degradation in the textual representations of a given degraded image. Intuitively restoration is much easier on text modality than image one. For example it can be easily conducted by removing degradation-related words while keeping the content-aware words. Hence we combine the advantages of images in detail description and ones of text in degradation removal to perform restoration. To address the cross-modal assistance we propose to map the degraded images into textual representations for removing the degradations and then convert the restored textual representations into a guidance image for assisting image restoration. In particular We ingeniously embed an image-to-text mapper and text restoration module into CLIP-equipped text-to-image models to generate the guidance. Then we adopt a simple coarse-to-fine approach to dynamically inject multi-scale information from guidance to image restoration networks. Extensive experiments are conducted on various image restoration tasks including deblurring dehazing deraining and denoising and all-in-one image restoration.

Second they are insensitive to local edits and can irreversibly affect non-edited regions leaving obvious editing traces. To tackle these problems we propose a Zero-shot instructiON-guided local image Editing approach termed ZONE. We first convert the editing intent from the user-provided instruction (e.g. \"make his tie blue\") into specific image editing regions through InstructPix2Pix.

We further develop an edge smoother based on FFT for seamless blending between the layer and the image.Our method allows for arbitrary manipulation of a specific region with a single instruction while preserving the rest.

To provide precise supervision on the depth of the objects we present a novel Ground-contacting-prior Disparity Smoothness Loss (GDS-Loss) that encourages a DE network to align the depth of the objects with their ground-contacting points. Subsequently in the fine training stage we refine the DE network to learn the detailed depth of the objects from the reprojection loss while ensuring accurate DE on the moving object regions by employing our regularization loss with a cost-volume-based weighting factor.

In this paper we extend the ability of controllable generative models for a more comprehensive hand mesh recovery task: direct hand mesh generation inpainting reconstruction and fitting in a single framework which we name as Holistic Hand Mesh Recovery (HHMR). Our key observation is that different kinds of hand mesh recovery tasks can be achieved by a single generative model with strong multimodal controllability and in such a framework realizing different tasks only requires giving different signals as conditions. To achieve this goal we propose an all-in-one diffusion framework based on graph convolution and attention mechanisms for holistic hand mesh recovery. In order to achieve strong control generation capability while ensuring the decoupling of multimodal control signals we map different modalities to a share feature space and apply cross-scale random masking in both modality and feature levels. In this way the correlation between different modalities can be fully exploited during the learning of hand priors. Furthermore we propose Condition-aligned Gradient Guidance to enhance the alignment of the generated model with the control signals which significantly improves the accuracy of the hand mesh reconstruction and fitting.

While manipulating prompt formats could improve outputs designing specific and precise prompts per task can be challenging and ineffective. To tackle this issue we introduce a novel inference method Prompt Highlighter which enables users to highlight specific prompt spans to interactively control the focus during generation.

    "abstract": "Few-shot semantic segmentation (FSS) has achieved great success on segmenting objects of novel classes supported by only a few annotated samples. However existing FSS methods often underperform in the presence of domain shifts especially when encountering new domain styles that are unseen during training. It is suboptimal to directly adapt or generalize the entire model to new domains in the few-shot scenario. Instead our key idea is to adapt a small adapter for rectifying diverse target domain styles to the source domain. Consequently the rectified target domain features can fittingly benefit from the well-optimized source domain segmentation model which is intently trained on sufficient source domain data. Training domain-rectifying adapter requires sufficiently diverse target domains. We thus propose a novel local-global style perturbation method to simulate diverse potential target domains by perturbating the feature channel statistics of the individual images and collective statistics of the entire source domain respectively. Additionally we propose a cyclic domain alignment module to facilitate the adapter effectively rectifying domains using a reverse domain rectification supervision. The adapter is trained to rectify the image features from diverse synthesized target domains to align with the source domain. During testing on target domains we start by rectifying the image features and then conduct few-shot segmentation on the domain-rectified features.

    "abstract": "The problem of self-calibration of two cameras from a given fundamental matrix is one of the basic problems in geometric computer vision. Under the assumption of known principal points and square pixels the Bougnoux formula offers a means to compute the two unknown focal lengths. However in many practical situations the formula yields inaccurate results due to commonly occurring singularities. Moreover the estimates are sensitive to noise in the computed fundamental matrix and to the assumed positions of the principal points. In this paper we therefore propose an efficient and robust iterative method to estimate the focal lengths along with the principal points of the cameras given a fundamental matrix and priors for the estimated camera intrinsics. In addition we study a computationally efficient check of models generated within RANSAC that improves the accuracy of the estimated models while reducing the total computational time. Extensive experiments on real and synthetic data show that our iterative method brings significant improvements in terms of the accuracy of the estimated focal lengths over the Bougnoux formula and other state-of-the-art methods even when relying on inaccurate priors.

In fact data must be continuously obtained in a series of small batches and the model must also be continuously trained to achieve generalizability and scalability by improving the biased data distribution. This paper addresses the training cost and catastrophic forgetting problems when continuously updating models to adapt to incoming small batches from various environments for real-world motion prediction in autonomous driving. To this end we propose a novel continual motion prediction (CMP) learning framework based on sparse meta-representation learning and an optimal memory buffer retention strategy. In meta-representation learning a model explicitly learns a sparse representation of each driving environment from road geometry to vehicle states by training to reduce catastrophic forgetting based on an augmented modulation network with sparsity regularization. Also in the adaptation phase We develop an Optimal Memory Buffer Retention strategy that smartly preserves diverse samples by focusing on representation similarity. This approach handles the nuanced task distribution shifts characteristic of motion prediction datasets ensuring our model stays responsive to evolving input variations without requiring extensive resources.

PartDistill addresses three major challenges in this task: the lack of 3D segmentation in invisible or undetected regions in the 2D projections inconsistent 2D predictions by VLMs and the lack of knowledge accumulation across different 3D shapes. PartDistill consists of a teacher network that uses a VLM to make 2D predictions and a student network that learns from the 2D predictions while extracting geometrical features from multiple 3D shapes to carry out 3D part segmentation. A bi-directional distillation including forward and backward distillations is carried out within the framework where the former forward distills the 2D predictions to the student network and the latter improves the quality of the 2D predictions which subsequently enhances the final 3D segmentation. Moreover PartDistill can exploit generative models that facilitate effortless 3D shape creation for generating knowledge sources to be distilled.

    "abstract": "In the domain of compressive sensing (CS) deep unfolding networks (DUNs) have garnered attention for their good performance and certain degree of interpretability rooted in CS domain achieved by marrying traditional optimization solvers with deep networks. However current DUNs are ill-suited for the intricate task of capturing fine-grained image details leading to perceptible distortions and blurriness in reconstructed images particularly at low CS ratios e.g. 0.10 and below. In this paper we propose CPP-Net a novel deep unfolding CS framework inspired by the primal-dual hybrid strategy of the Chambolle and Pock Proximal Point Algorithm (CP-PPA). First we derive three iteration submodules Xk Vk and Yk by incorporating customized deep learning modules to solve the sparse basis related proximal operator within CP-PPA. Second we design the Dual Path Fusion Block (DPFB) to adeptly extract and fuse multi-scale feature information enhancing sensitivity to feature information at different scales and improving detail reconstruction. Third we introduce the Iteration Fusion Strategy (IFS) to effectively weight the fusion of outputs from diverse reconstruction stages maximizing the utilization of feature information and mitigating the information loss during reconstruction stages. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CPP-Net effectively reduces distortion and blurriness while preserving richer image details outperforming current state-of-the-art methods.

Current deep image watermarking while widely accepted for safeguarding visual content can only protect copyright and ensure traceability.

To solve this challenge we propose an innovative proactive forensics framework EditGuard to unify copyright protection and tamper-agnostic localization especially for AIGC-based editing methods. It can offer a meticulous embedding of imperceptible watermarks and precise decoding of tampered areas and copyright information. Leveraging our observed fragility and locality of image-into-image steganography the realization of EditGuard can be converted into a united image-bit steganography issue thus completely decoupling the training process from the tampering types. Extensive experiments verify that our EditGuard balances the tamper localization accuracy copyright recovery precision and generalizability to various AIGC-based tampering methods especially for image forgery that is difficult for the naked eye to detect",

Instead of the naive approach of directly optimizing 3DGs per-frame we employ a compact Neural Transformation Cache (NTC) to model the translations and rotations of 3DGs markedly reducing the training time and storage required for each FVV frame. Furthermore we propose an adaptive 3DG addition strategy to handle emerging objects in dynamic scenes.

    "abstract": "Accurate and controllable image editing is a challenging task that has attracted significant attention recently. Notably DragGAN developed by Pan et al. (2023) is an interactive point-based image editing framework that achieves impressive editing results with pixel-level precision. However due to its reliance on generative adversarial networks (GANs) its generality is limited by the capacity of pretrained GAN models. In this work we extend this editing framework to diffusion models and propose a novel approach DragDiffusion. By harnessing large-scale pretrained diffusion models we greatly enhance the applicability of interactive point-based editing on both real and diffusion-generated images. Unlike other diffusion-based editing methods that provide guidance on diffusion latents of multiple time steps our approach achieves efficient yet accurate spatial control by optimizing the latent of only one time step. This novel design is motivated by our observations that UNet features at a specific time step provides sufficient semantic and geometric information to support the drag-based editing. Moreover we introduce two additional techniques namely identity-preserving fine-tuning and reference-latent-control to further preserve the identity of the original image. Lastly we present a challenging benchmark dataset called DragBench---the first benchmark to evaluate the performance of interactive point-based image editing methods. Experiments across a wide range of challenging cases (e.g. images with multiple objects diverse object categories various styles etc.) demonstrate the versatility and generality of DragDiffusion.

To capture the expressive detailed nature of human heads including hair ears and finer-scale eye movements we propose to couple speech signal with the latent space of neural parametric head models to create high-fidelity temporally coherent motion sequences. We propose a new latent diffusion model for this task operating in the expression space of neural parametric head models to synthesize audio-driven realistic head sequences. In the absence of a dataset with corresponding NPHM expressions to audio we optimize for these correspondences to produce a dataset of temporally-optimized NPHM expressions fit to audio-video recordings of people talking. To the best of our knowledge this is the first work to propose a generative approach for realistic and high-quality motion synthesis of volumetric human heads representing a significant advancement in the field of audio-driven 3D animation. Notably our approach stands out in its ability to generate plausible motion sequences that can produce high-fidelity head animation coupled with the NPHM shape space.

To address this problem we introduce a 3D smoothing filter to constrains the size of the 3D Gaussian primitives based on the maximal sampling frequency induced by the input views. It eliminates high-frequency artifacts when zooming in. Moreover replacing 2D dilation with a 2D Mip filter which simulates a 2D box filter effectively mitigates aliasing and dilation issues.

However the realness and diversity of pseudo LR images are vulnerable due to the large image space. In this paper we circumvent the difficulty of image generation and propose an alternative to build the connection between unpaired images in a compact proxy space. Specifically we first construct coupled HR and LR dictionaries and then encode HR and LR images into a common latent code space using these dictionaries. In addition we develop an autoencoder-based framework to couple these dictionaries during optimization by reconstructing input HR and LR images. The coupled dictionaries enable our method to employ a shallow network architecture with only 18 layers to achieve efficient image SR.

However different background contexts of support and query images can cause their foreground features to be misaligned. This phenomenon known as background context bias can hinder the effectiveness of support prototypes in guiding query image segmentation.

In each iteration of the framework we first generate a query prediction based on a support foreground feature. Next we extract background context from the query image to modulate the support foreground feature thus eliminating the foreground feature misalignment caused by the different backgrounds. After that we design a confidence-biased attention to eliminate noise and cleanse information. By integrating these components through an iterative structure we create a novel network that can leverage the synergies between different modules to improve their performance in a mutually reinforcing manner. Through these carefully designed components and structures our network can effectively eliminate background context bias in few-shot segmentation thus achieving outstanding performance.

    "abstract": "Current video anomaly detection (VAD) approaches with weak supervisions are inherently limited to a closed-set setting and may struggle in open-world applications where there can be anomaly categories in the test data unseen during training. A few recent studies attempt to tackle a more realistic setting open-set VAD which aims to detect unseen anomalies given seen anomalies and normal videos. However such a setting focuses on predicting frame anomaly scores having no ability to recognize the specific categories of anomalies despite the fact that this ability is essential for building more informed video surveillance systems. This paper takes a step further and explores open-vocabulary video anomaly detection (OVVAD) in which we aim to leverage pre-trained large models to detect and categorize seen and unseen anomalies. To this end we propose a model that decouples OVVAD into two mutually complementary tasks - class-agnostic detection and class-specific classification - and jointly optimizes both tasks. Particularly we devise a semantic knowledge injection module to introduce semantic knowledge from large language models for the detection task and design a novel anomaly synthesis module to generate pseudo unseen anomaly videos with the help of large vision generation models for the classification task. These semantic knowledge and synthesis anomalies substantially extend our model's capability in detecting and categorizing a variety of seen and unseen anomalies.

    "abstract": "Abstract In recent years text-image joint pre-training techniques have shown promising results in various tasks. However in Optical Character Recognition (OCR) tasks aligning text instances with their corresponding text regions in images poses a challenge as it requires effective alignment between text and OCR-Text (referring to the text in images as OCR-Text to distinguish from the text in natural language) rather than a holistic understanding of the overall image content. In this paper we propose a new pre-training method called OCR-Text Destylization Modeling (ODM) that transfers diverse styles of text found in images to a uniform style based on the text prompt. With ODM we achieve better alignment between text and OCR-Text and enable pre-trained models to adapt to the complex and diverse styles of scene text detection and spotting tasks. Additionally we have designed a new labeling generation method specifically for ODM and combined it with our proposed Text-Controller module to address the challenge of annotation costs in OCR tasks allowing a larger amount of unlabeled data to participate in pre-training. Extensive experiments on multiple public datasets demonstrate that our method significantly improves performance and outperforms current pre-training methods in scene text detection and spotting tasks.

    "abstract": "Despite many attempts to leverage pre-trained text-to-image models (T2I) like Stable Diffusion (SD) for controllable image editing producing good predictable results remains a challenge. Previous approaches have focused on either fine-tuning pre-trained T2I models on specific datasets to generate certain kinds of images (e.g. with a specific object or person) or on optimizing the weights text prompts and/or learning features for each input image in an attempt to coax the image generator to produce the desired result. However these approaches all have shortcomings and fail to produce good results in a predictable and controllable manner. To address this problem we present TiNO-Edit an SD-based method that focuses on optimizing the noise patterns and diffusion timesteps during editing something previously unexplored in the literature. With this simple change we are able to generate results that both better align with the original images and reflect the desired result. Furthermore we propose a set of new loss functions that operate in the latent domain of SD greatly speeding up the optimization when compared to prior losses which operate in the pixel domain. Our method can be easily applied to variations of SD including Textual Inversion and DreamBooth that encode new concepts and incorporate them into the edited results.

Specifically we propose a gradient-based approach to assess epistemic uncertainty analyzing the gradients of outputs relative to model parameters and thereby indicating necessary model adjustments to accurately represent the inputs. We first explore theoretical guarantees of gradient-based methods for epistemic UQ questioning the view that this uncertainty is only calculable through differences between multiple models. We further improve gradient-driven UQ by using class-specific weights for integrating gradients and emphasizing distinct contributions from neural network layers. Additionally we enhance UQ accuracy by combining gradient and perturbation methods to refine the gradients. We evaluate our approach on out-of-distribution detection uncertainty calibration and active learning demonstrating its superiority over current state-of-the-art UQ methods for pre-trained models",

    "abstract": "Diffusion models excel at modeling complex and multimodal trajectory distributions for decision-making and control. Reward-gradient guided denoising has been recently proposed to generate trajectories that maximize both a differentiable reward function and the likelihood under the data distribution captured by a diffusion model. Reward-gradient guided denoising requires a differentiable reward function fitted to both clean and noised samples limiting its applicability as a general trajectory optimizer. In this paper we propose DiffusionES a method that combines gradient-free optimization with trajectory denoising to optimize black-box non-differentiable objectives while staying in the data manifold. Diffusion-ES samples trajectories during evolutionary search from a diffusion model and scores them using a black-box reward function. It mutates high-scoring trajectories using a truncated diffusion process that applies a small number of noising and denoising steps allowing for much more efficient exploration of the solution space. We show that DiffusionES achieves state-of-the-art performance on nuPlan an established closed-loop planning benchmark for autonomous driving. Diffusion-ES outperforms existing sampling-based planners reactive deterministic or diffusion-based policies and reward-gradient guidance. Additionally we show that unlike prior guidance methods our method can optimize non-differentiable language-shaped reward functions generated by few-shot LLM prompting. When guided by a human teacher that issues instructions to follow our method can generate novel highly complex behaviors such as aggressive lane weaving which are not present in the training data. This allows us to solve the hardest nuPlan scenarios which are beyond the capabilities of existing trajectory optimization methods and driving policies",

    "abstract": "Nonlinearities are decisive in neural representation learning. Traditional Activation (Act) functions impose fixed inductive biases on neural networks with oriented biological intuitions. Recent methods leverage self-gated curves to compensate for the rigid traditional Act paradigms in fitting flexibility. However substantial improvements are still impeded by the norm-induced mismatched feature re-calibrations (see Section 1) i.e. the actual importance of a feature can be inconsistent with its explicit intensity such that violates the basic intention of a direct self-gated feature re-weighting. To address this problem we propose to learn discriminative neural feature Act with a novel prototype namely AdaShift which enhances typical self-gated Act by incorporating an adaptive shift factor into the re-weighting function of Act. AdaShift casts dynamic translations on the inputs of a re-weighting function by exploiting comprehensive feature-filter context cues of different ranges in a simple yet effective manner. We obtain the new intuitions of AdaShift by rethinking the feature-filter relationships from a common Softmax-based classification and by generalizing the new observations to a common learning layer that encodes features with updatable filters. Our practical AdaShifts built upon the new Act prototype demonstrate significant improvements to the popular/SOTA Act functions on different vision benchmarks. By simply replacing ReLU with AdaShifts ResNets can match advanced Transformer counterparts (e.g. ResNet-50 vs. Swin-T) with lower cost and fewer parameters",

Recent research has introduced tuning methods that make subtle adjustments to the original models yielding promising results in specific adaptations of foundational generative diffusion models. Rather than modifying the main backbone of the diffusion model we delve into the role of skip connection in U-Net and reveal that hierarchical features aggregating long-distance information across encoder and decoder make a significant impact on the content and quality of image generation. Based on the observation we propose an efficient generative tuning framework dubbed SCEdit which integrates and edits Skip Connection using a lightweight tuning module named SC-Tuner. Furthermore the proposed framework allows for straightforward extension to controllable image synthesis by injecting different conditions with Controllable SC-Tuner simplifying and unifying the network design for multi-condition inputs. Our SCEdit substantially reduces training parameters memory usage and computational expense due to its lightweight tuners with backward propagation only passing to the decoder blocks.

Our method dubbed MRC-Net comprises two stages. The first performs pose classification and renders the 3D object in the classified pose. The second stage performs regression to predict fine-grained residual pose within class. Connecting the two stages is a novel multi-scale residual correlation (MRC) layer that captures high-and-low level correspondences between the input image and rendering from first stage. MRC-Net employs a Siamese network with shared weights between both stages to learn embeddings for input and rendered images. To mitigate ambiguity when predicting discrete pose class labels on symmetric objects we use soft probabilistic labels to define pose class in the first stage. We demonstrate state-of-the-art accuracy outperforming all competing RGB-based methods on four challenging BOP benchmark datasets: T-LESS LM-O YCB-V and ITODD.

    "abstract": "Monocular 3D object detection has attracted widespread attention due to its potential to accurately obtain object 3D localization from a single image at a low cost. Depth estimation is an essential but challenging subtask of monocular 3D object detection due to the ill-posedness of 2D to 3D mapping. Many methods explore multiple local depth clues such as object heights and keypoints and then formulate the object depth estimation as an ensemble of multiple depth predictions to mitigate the insufficiency of single-depth information. However the errors of existing multiple depths tend to have the same sign which hinders them from neutralizing each other and limits the overall accuracy of combined depth. To alleviate this problem we propose to increase the complementarity of depths with two novel designs. First we add a new depth prediction branch named complementary depth that utilizes global and efficient depth clues from the entire image rather than the local clues to reduce the correlation of depth predictions. Second we propose to fully exploit the geometric relations between multiple depth clues to achieve complementarity in form. Benefiting from these designs our method achieves higher complementarity. Experiments on the KITTI benchmark demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance without introducing extra data. In addition complementary depth can also be a lightweight and plug-and-play module to boost multiple existing monocular 3d object detectors.

    "abstract": "Score distillation sampling (SDS) and its variants have greatly boosted the development of text-to-3D generation but are vulnerable to geometry collapse and poor textures yet. To solve this issue we first deeply analyze the SDS and find that its distillation sampling process indeed corresponds to the trajectory sampling of a stochastic differential equation (SDE): SDS samples along an SDE trajectory to yield a less noisy sample which then serves as a guidance to optimize a 3D model. However the randomness in SDE sampling often leads to a diverse and unpredictable sample which is not always less noisy and thus is not a consistently correct guidance explaining the vulnerability of SDS. Since for any SDE there always exists an ordinary differential equation (ODE) whose trajectory sampling can deterministically and consistently converge to the desired target point as the SDE we propose a novel and effective \"Consistent3D\" method that explores the ODE deterministic sampling prior for text-to-3D generation. Specifically at each training iteration given a rendered image by a 3D model we first estimate its desired 3D score function by a pre-trained 2D diffusion model and build an ODE for trajectory sampling. Next we design a consistency distillation sampling loss which samples along the ODE trajectory to generate two adjacent samples and uses the less noisy sample to guide another more noisy one for distilling the deterministic prior into the 3D model.

    "abstract": "Robot manipulation relies on accurately predicting contact points and end-effector directions to ensure successful operation. However learning-based robot manipulation trained on a limited category within a simulator often struggles to achieve generalizability especially when confronted with extensive categories. Therefore we introduce an innovative approach for robot manipulation that leverages the robust reasoning capabilities of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to enhance the stability and generalization of manipulation. By fine-tuning the injected adapters we preserve the inherent common sense and reasoning ability of the MLLMs while equipping them with the ability for manipulation. The fundamental insight lies in the introduced fine-tuning paradigm encompassing object category understanding affordance prior reasoning and object-centric pose prediction to stimulate the reasoning ability of MLLM in manipulation. During inference our approach utilizes an RGB image and text prompt to predict the end effector's pose in chain of thoughts. After the initial contact is established an active impedance adaptation policy is introduced to plan the upcoming waypoints in a closed-loop manner. Moreover in real world we design a test-time adaptation (TTA) strategy for manipulation to enable the model better adapt to the current real-world scene configuration.

    "abstract": "In this paper we address the challenge of image resolution variation for the Segment Anything Model (SAM). SAM known for its zero-shot generalizability exhibits a performance degradation when faced with datasets with varying image sizes. Previous approaches tend to resize the image to a fixed size or adopt structure modifications hindering the preservation of SAM's rich prior knowledge. Besides such task-specific tuning necessitates a complete retraining of the model which is cost-expensive and unacceptable for deployment in the downstream tasks. In this paper we reformulate this challenge as a length extrapolation problem where token sequence length varies while maintaining a consistent patch size for images with different sizes. To this end we propose a Scalable Bias-Mode Attention Mask (BA-SAM) to enhance SAM's adaptability to varying image resolutions while eliminating the need for structure modifications. Firstly we introduce a new scaling factor to ensure consistent magnitude in the attention layer's dot product values when the token sequence length changes. Secondly we present a bias-mode attention mask that allows each token to prioritize neighboring information mitigating the impact of untrained distant information. Our BA-SAM demonstrates efficacy in two scenarios: zero-shot and fine-tuning. Extensive evaluation of diverse datasets including DIS5K DUTS ISIC COD10K and COCO reveals its ability to significantly mitigate performance degradation in the zero-shot setting and achieve state-of-the-art performance with minimal fine-tuning. Furthermore we propose a generalized model and benchmark showcasing BA-SAM's generalizability across all four datasets simultaneously",

In this field Data-Free Knowledge Transfer (DFKT) plays a crucial role in addressing catastrophic forgetting and data privacy problems. However prior approaches lack the crucial synergy between DFKT and the model training phases causing DFKT to encounter difficulties in generating high-quality data from a non-anchored latent space of the old task model. In this paper we introduce LANDER (Label Text Centered Data-Free Knowledge Transfer) to address this issue by utilizing label text embeddings (LTE) produced by pretrained language models. Specifically during the model training phase our approach treats LTE as anchor points and constrains the feature embeddings of corresponding training samples around them enriching the surrounding area with more meaningful information. In the DFKT phase by using these LTE anchors LANDER can synthesize more meaningful samples thereby effectively addressing the forgetting problem. Additionally instead of tightly constraining embeddings toward the anchor the Bounding Loss is introduced to encourage sample embeddings to remain flexible within a defined radius. This approach preserves the natural differences in sample embeddings and mitigates the embedding overlap caused by heterogeneous federated settings. Extensive experiments conducted on CIFAR100 Tiny-ImageNet and ImageNet demonstrate that LANDER significantly outperforms previous methods and achieves state-of-the-art performance in FCIL.

Motivated by classic spectral clustering we formulate this analysis in terms of an optimization objective involving a set of affinity matrices each formed by comparing features within a different layer. Solving this optimization problem using gradient descent allows our technique to scale from single images to dataset-level analysis including in the latter both intra- and inter-image relationships. Analyzing a pre-trained generative transformer provides insight into the computational strategy learned by such models. Equating affinity with key-query similarity across attention layers yields eigenvectors encoding scene spatial layout whereas defining affinity by value vector similarity yields eigenvectors encoding object identity. This result suggests that key and query vectors coordinate attentional information flow according to spatial proximity (a `where' pathway) while value vectors refine a semantic category representation (a `what' pathway)",

In this work we present Grounding LMM (GLaMM) the first model that can generate natural language responses seamlessly intertwined with corresponding object segmentation masks. GLaMM not only grounds objects appearing in the conversations but is flexible enough to accept both textual and optional visual prompts (region of interest) as input.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Most of the previous exposure correction methods learn dense pixel-wise transformations to achieve promising results but consume huge computational resources. Recently Learnable 3D lookup tables (3D LUTs) have demonstrated impressive performance and efficiency for image enhancement. However these methods can only perform global transformations and fail to finely manipulate local regions. Moreover they uniformly downsample the input image which loses the rich color information and limits the learning of color transformation capabilities. In this paper we present a collaborative transformation framework (CoTF) for real-time exposure correction which integrates global transformation with pixel-wise transformations in an efficient manner. Specifically the global transformation adjusts the overall appearance using image-adaptive 3D LUTs to provide decent global contrast and sharp details while the pixel transformation compensates for local context. Then a relation-aware modulation module is designed to combine these two components effectively. In addition we propose an adaptive sampling strategy to preserve more color information by predicting the sampling intervals thus providing higher quality input data for the learning of 3D LUTs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method can process high-resolution images in real-time on GPUs while achieving comparable performance against current state-of-the-art methods.

    "abstract": "Diffusion models have shown remarkable results for image generation editing and inpainting. Recent works explore diffusion models for 3D shape generation with neural implicit functions i.e. signed distance function and occupancy function. However they are limited to shapes with closed surfaces which prevents them from generating diverse 3D real-world contents containing open surfaces. In this work we present UDiFF a 3D diffusion model for unsigned distance fields (UDFs) which is capable to generate textured 3D shapes with open surfaces from text conditions or unconditionally. Our key idea is to generate UDFs in spatial-frequency domain with an optimal wavelet transformation which produces a compact representation space for UDF generation. Specifically instead of selecting an appropriate wavelet transformation which requires expensive manual efforts and still leads to large information loss we propose a data-driven approach to learn the optimal wavelet transformation for UDFs. We evaluate UDiFF to show our advantages by numerical and visual comparisons with the latest methods on widely used benchmarks. Page: https://weiqi-zhang.github.io/UDiFF",

    "abstract": "Active Speaker Detection (ASD) aims to identify who is speaking in each frame of a video. Solving ASD involves using audio and visual information in two complementary contexts: long-term intra-speaker context models the temporal dependencies of the same speaker while short-term inter-speaker context models the interactions of speakers in the same scene. Motivated by these observations we propose LoCoNet a simple but effective Long-Short Context Network that leverages Long-term Intra-speaker Modeling (LIM) and Short-term Inter-speaker Modeling (SIM) in an interleaved manner. LIM employs self-attention for long-range temporal dependencies modeling and cross-attention for audio-visual interactions modeling. SIM incorporates convolutional blocks that capture local patterns for short-term inter-speaker context. Experiments show that LoCoNet achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple datasets with 95.2% (+0.3%) mAP on AVA-ActiveSpeaker 97.2% (+2.7%) mAP on Talkies and 68.4% (+7.7%) mAP on Ego4D.

However these one-to-one constraint approaches often fail to maintain retrieval order consistency especially when the query network has limited representational capacity.

This framework shifts from absolute one-to-one supervision to optimizing the relational differences in pairwise similarities produced by the query and gallery networks thereby preserving a consistent retrieval order across both networks. Our method involves computing a pairwise similarity differential matrix within the gallery domain which is then decomposed into three components: feature representation knowledge inconsistent pairwise similarity differential knowledge and consistent pairwise similarity differential knowledge. This strategic decomposition aligns the retrieval ranking of the query network with the gallery network effectively.

    "abstract": "Deepfake detection faces a critical generalization hurdle with performance deteriorating when there is a mismatch between the distributions of training and testing data. A broadly received explanation is the tendency of these detectors to be overfitted to forgery-specific artifacts rather than learning features that are widely applicable across various forgeries. To address this issue we propose a simple yet effective detector called LSDA (\\underline L atent \\underline S pace \\underline D ata \\underline A ugmentation) which is based on a heuristic idea: representations with a wider variety of forgeries should be able to learn a more generalizable decision boundary thereby mitigating the overfitting of method-specific features (see Fig. 1). Following this idea we propose to enlarge the forgery space by constructing and simulating variations within and across forgery features in the latent space. This approach encompasses the acquisition of enriched domain-specific features and the facilitation of smoother transitions between different forgery types effectively bridging domain gaps. Our approach culminates in refining a binary classifier that leverages the distilled knowledge from the enhanced features striving for a generalizable deepfake detector. Comprehensive experiments show that our proposed method is surprisingly effective and transcends state-of-the-art detectors across several widely used benchmarks",

    "abstract": "Recent significant advances in text-to-image models unlock the possibility of training vision systems using synthetic images potentially overcoming the difficulty of collecting curated data at scale. It is unclear however how these models behave at scale as more synthetic data is added to the training set. In this paper we study the scaling laws of synthetic images generated by state of the art text-to-image models for the training of supervised models: image classifiers with label supervision and CLIP with language supervision. We identify several factors including text prompts classifier-free guidance scale and types of text-to-image models that significantly affect scaling behavior. After tuning these factors we observe that synthetic images demonstrate a scaling trend similar to but slightly less effective than real images in CLIP training while they significantly underperform in scaling when training supervised image classifiers. Our analysis indicates that the main reason for this underperformance is the inability of off-the-shelf text-to-image models to generate certain concepts a limitation that significantly impairs the training of image classifiers. Our findings also suggest that scaling synthetic data can be particularly effective in scenarios such as: (1) when there is a limited supply of real images for a supervised problem (e.g. fewer than 0.5 million images in ImageNet) (2) when the evaluation dataset diverges significantly from the training data indicating the out-of-distribution scenario or (3) when synthetic data is used in conjunction with real images as demonstrated in the training of CLIP models",

    "abstract": "The rapid advancement of deep learning models is often attributed to their ability to leverage massive training data. In contrast such privilege has not yet fully benefited 3D deep learning mainly due to the limited availability of large-scale 3D datasets. Merging multiple available data sources and letting them collaboratively train a single model is a potential solution. However due to the large domain gap between 3D point cloud datasets such mixed supervision could adversely affect the model's performance and lead to degenerated performance (i.e. negative transfer) compared to single-dataset training. In view of this challenge we introduce Point Prompt Training (PPT) a novel framework for multi-dataset synergistic learning in the context of 3D representation learning that supports multiple pre-training paradigms. Based on this framework we propose Prompt-driven Normalization which adapts the model to different datasets with domain-specific prompts and Language-guided Categorical Alignment that decently unifies the multiple-dataset label spaces by leveraging the relationship between label text. Extensive experiments verify that PPT can overcome the negative transfer associated with synergistic learning and produce generalizable representations. Notably it achieves state-of-the-art performance on each dataset using a single weight-shared model with supervised multi-dataset training. Moreover when served as a pre-training framework it outperforms other pre-training approaches regarding representation quality and attains remarkable state-of-the-art performance across over ten diverse downstream tasks spanning both indoor and outdoor 3D scenarios",

We address this challenge by introducing state-space models (SSMs) with learnable timescale parameters to event-based vision. This design adapts to varying frequencies without the need to retrain the network at different frequencies. Additionally we investigate two strategies to counteract aliasing effects when deploying the model at higher frequencies. We comprehensively evaluate our approach against existing methods based on RNN and Transformer architectures across various benchmarks including Gen1 and 1 Mpx event camera datasets. Our results demonstrate that SSM-based models train 33% faster and also exhibit minimal performance degradation when tested at higher frequencies than the training input.

    "abstract": "We propose a novel strategy ES3 for self-supervised learning of robust audio-visual speech representations from unlabeled talking face videos. While many recent approaches for this task primarily rely on guiding the learning process using the audio modality alone to capture information shared between audio and video we reframe the problem as the acquisition of shared unique (modality-specific) and synergistic speech information to address the inherent asymmetry between the modalities. Based on this formulation we propose a novel \"evolving\" strategy that progressively builds joint audio-visual speech representations that are strong for both uni-modal (audio & visual) and bi-modal (audio-visual) speech. First we leverage the more easily learnable audio modality to initialize audio and visual representations by capturing audio-unique and shared speech information. Next we incorporate video-unique speech information and bootstrap the audio-visual representations on top of the previously acquired shared knowledge. Finally we maximize the total audio-visual speech information including synergistic information to obtain robust and comprehensive representations. We implement ES3 as a simple Siamese framework and experiments on both English benchmarks and a newly contributed large-scale Mandarin dataset show its effectiveness. In particular on LRS2-BBC our smallest model is on par with SoTA models with only 1/2 parameters and 1/8 unlabeled data (223h)",

While existing state-of-the-art methods have demonstrated success in reconstructing non-rigid objects using neural field representations conventional feed-forward networks encounter challenges with ambiguous observations from noisy partial or sparse point clouds. To address these challenges we introduce a diffusion model that explicitly learns the shape and motion distribution of non-rigid objects through an iterative denoising process of compressed latent representations. The diffusion-based priors enable more plausible and probabilistic reconstructions when handling ambiguous inputs. We parameterize 4D dynamics with latent sets instead of using global latent codes. This novel 4D representation allows us to learn local shape and deformation patterns leading to more accurate non-linear motion capture and significantly improving generalizability to unseen motions and identities. For more temporally-coherent object tracking we synchronously denoise deformation latent sets and exchange information across multiple frames. To avoid computational overhead we designed an interleaved space and time attention block to alternately aggregate deformation latents along spatial and temporal domains.

In this paper we propose DiaLoc a new dialog-based localization framework which aligns with a real human operator behavior. Specifically we produce an iterative refinement of location predictions which can visualize current pose believes after each dialog turn. DiaLoc effectively utilizes the multimodal data for multi-shot localization where a fusion encoder fuses vision and dialog information iteratively. We achieve state-of-the-art results on embodied dialog-based localization task in single-shot (+7.08% in Acc5@valUnseen) and multi-shot settings (+10.85% in Acc5@valUnseen).

    "abstract": "Visual program synthesis is a promising approach to exploit the reasoning abilities of large language models for compositional computer vision tasks. Previous work has used few-shot prompting with frozen LLMs to synthesize visual programs. Training an LLM to write better visual programs is an attractive prospect but it is unclear how to accomplish this. No dataset of visual programs for training exists and acquisition of a visual program dataset cannot be easily crowdsourced due to the need for expert annotators. To get around the lack of direct supervision we explore improving the program synthesis abilities of an LLM using feedback from interactive experience. We propose a method where we exploit existing annotations for a vision-language task to improvise a coarse reward signal for that task treat the LLM as a policy and apply reinforced self-training to improve the visual program synthesis ability of the LLM for that task. We describe a series of experiments on object detection compositional visual question answering and image-text retrieval and show that in each case the self-trained LLM outperforms or performs on par with few-shot frozen LLMs that are an order of magnitude larger.

This paper presents Attend to eXpert Prompts (A2XP) a novel approach for domain generalization that preserves the privacy and integrity of the network architecture. A2XP consists of two phases: Expert Adaptation and Domain Generalization. In the first phase prompts for each source domain are optimized to guide the model towards the optimal direction. In the second phase two embedder networks are trained to effectively amalgamate these expert prompts aiming for an optimal output. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that A2XP achieves state-of-the-art results over existing non-private domain generalization methods.

This paper introduces a pioneering framework tailored for low-light VOS leveraging event camera data to elevate segmentation accuracy.

Our proposed active sampling strategy addresses this issue using an active learning approach that simultaneously accounts for uncertainty and undetectability. Our newly proposed False Negative Prediction Module evaluates the undetectability of images containing undetected objects enabling more informed active sampling. This approach considers previously overlooked undetected objects thereby reducing false negative errors.

We first introduce super-parts by grouping geometrically similar parts without any semantic labels. Then we employ a part-whole hierarchical encoder wherein a super-part encoder predicts latent super-part poses based on input parts. Subsequently we transform the point cloud using the latent poses feeding it to the part encoder for aggregating super-part information and reasoning about part relationships to predict all part poses.

In this work we propose a novel approach to enhance temporal consistency in generated videos by merging self-attention tokens across frames. By aligning and compressing temporally redundant tokens across frames our method improves temporal coherence and reduces memory consumption in self-attention computations. The merging strategy matches and aligns tokens according to the temporal correspondence between frames facilitating natural temporal consistency in generated video frames. To manage the complexity of video processing we divide videos into chunks and develop intra-chunk local token merging and inter-chunk global token merging ensuring both short-term video continuity and long-term content consistency.

    "abstract": "Recently subject-driven generation has garnered significant interest due to its ability to personalize text-to-image generation. Typical works focus on learning the new subject's private attributes. However an important fact has not been taken seriously that a subject is not an isolated new concept but should be a specialization of a certain category in the pre-trained model. This results in the subject failing to comprehensively inherit the attributes in its category causing poor attribute-related generations. In this paper motivated by object-oriented programming we model the subject as a derived class whose base class is its semantic category. This modeling enables the subject to inherit public attributes from its category while learning its private attributes from the user-provided example. Specifically we propose a plug-and-play method Subject-Derived regularization (SuDe). It constructs the base-derived class modeling by constraining the subject-driven generated images to semantically belong to the subject's category. Extensive experiments under three baselines and two backbones on various subjects show that our SuDe enables imaginative attribute-related generations while maintaining subject fidelity.

Different from the previous evaluation paradigms only in consideration of global attribute variations (e.g. adverse weather) we investigate both local and global attribute variations for robustness evaluation. To achieve this we construct a mask-preserved attribute editing pipeline to edit visual attributes of real images with precise control of structural information. Therefore the original segmentation labels can be reused for the edited images. Using our pipeline we construct a benchmark covering both object and image attributes (e.g. color material pattern style). We evaluate a broad variety of semantic segmentation models spanning from conventional close-set models to recent open-vocabulary large models on their robustness to different types of variations. We find that both local and global attribute variations affect segmentation performances and the sensitivity of models diverges across different variation types. We argue that local attributes have the same importance as global attributes and should be considered in the robustness evaluation of segmentation models. Code: https://github.com/PRIS-CV/Pascal-EA",

Some recent fine-tuning methods have made it feasible for individuals to implant personalized concepts onto the basic Stable Diffusion model with minimal computational costs on small datasets.

In recent studies researchers have explored the addition of imperceptible adversarial perturbations to images to prevent potential unauthorized exploitation and infringements when personal data is used for fine-tuning Stable Diffusion. Although these studies have demonstrated the ability to protect images it is essential to consider that these methods may not be entirely applicable in real-world scenarios. In this paper we systematically evaluate the use of perturbations to protect images within a practical threat model. The results suggest that these approaches may not be sufficient to safeguard image privacy and copyright effectively. Furthermore we introduce a purification method capable of removing protected perturbations while preserving the original image structure to the greatest extent possible.

To this end we first collect Multisensory Universe a large-scale multisensory interaction dataset comprising 500k data by deploying an LLM-powered embodied agent to engage with the 3D environment. To perform instruction tuning with pre-trained LLM on such generated data we first encode the 3D scene as abstracted object-centric representations and then introduce action tokens denoting that the embodied agent takes certain actions within the environment as well as state tokens that represent the multisensory state observations of the agent at each time step.

    "abstract": "The goal of the multi-sound source localization task is to localize sound sources from the mixture individually. While recent multi-sound source localization methods have shown improved performance they face challenges due to their reliance on prior information about the number of objects to be separated. In this paper to overcome this limitation we present a novel multi-sound source localization method that can perform localization without prior knowledge of the number of sound sources. To achieve this goal we propose an iterative object identification (IOI) module which can recognize sound-making objects in an iterative manner. After finding the regions of sound-making objects we devise object similarity-aware clustering (OSC) loss to guide the IOI module to effectively combine regions of the same object but also distinguish between different objects and backgrounds. It enables our method to perform accurate localization of sound-making objects without any prior knowledge. Extensive experimental results on the MUSIC and VGGSound benchmarks show the significant performance improvements of the proposed method over the existing methods for both single and multi-source.

    "abstract": "Recent works in implicit representations such as Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) have advanced the generation of realistic and animatable head avatars from video sequences. These implicit methods are still confronted by visual artifacts and jitters since the lack of explicit geometric constraints poses a fundamental challenge in accurately modeling complex facial deformations. In this paper we introduce Dynamic Tetrahedra (DynTet) a novel hybrid representation that encodes explicit dynamic meshes by neural networks to ensure geometric consistency across various motions and viewpoints. DynTet is parameterized by the coordinate-based networks which learn signed distance deformation and material texture anchoring the training data into a predefined tetrahedra grid. Leveraging Marching Tetrahedra DynTet efficiently decodes textured meshes with a consistent topology enabling fast rendering through a differentiable rasterizer and supervision via a pixel loss. To enhance training efficiency we incorporate classical 3D Morphable Models to facilitate geometry learning and define a canonical space for simplifying texture learning. These advantages are readily achievable owing to the effective geometric representation employed in DynTet. Compared with prior works DynTet demonstrates significant improvements in fidelity lip synchronization and real-time performance according to various metrics. Beyond producing stable and visually appealing synthesis videos our method also outputs the dynamic meshes which is promising to enable many emerging applications.

Due to the extremely challenging nature of this task where learning is carried out without any annotations privacy-critical collaborative learning of US-VAD systems has not been studied yet. As surveillance videos are privacy sensitive and the availability of large-scale video data may enable better US-VAD systems collaborative learning can be highly rewarding in this setting. In this paper we propose a new baseline for anomaly detection capable of localizing anomalous events in complex surveillance scenarios in a fully unsupervised fashion without any labels on a privacy-retaining participant-based distributed training configuration. Additionally we propose three new evaluation protocols to extensively evaluate anomaly detection approaches on various scenarios of collaborations and data availability. Moreover based on these protocols we modify existing VAD datasets to extensively evaluate our approach as well as existing US SOTA methods on two large-scale datasets including UCF-Crime and XD-Violence.

In specific mPrompt leverages point annotations to tune the segmenter and predict pseudo head masks in a way of point prompt learning. It then uses the predicted segmentation masks which serve as spatial constraint to rectify biased point annotations as context prompt learning. mPrompt defines a way of mutual information maximization from prompt learning mitigating the impact of annotation variance while improving model accuracy.

    "abstract": "The perception of 3D motion of surrounding traffic participants is crucial for driving safety. While existing works primarily focus on general large motions we contend that the instantaneous detection and quantification of subtle motions is equally important as they indicate the nuances in driving behavior that may be safety critical such as behaviors near a stop sign of parking positions. We delve into this under-explored task examining its unique challenges and developing our solution accompanied by a carefully designed benchmark. Specifically due to the lack of correspondences between consecutive frames of sparse Lidar point clouds static objects might appear to be moving - the so-called swimming effect. This intertwines with the true object motion thereby posing ambiguity in accurate estimation especially for subtle motion. To address this we propose to leverage local occupancy completion of object point clouds to densify the shape cue and mitigate the impact of swimming artifacts. The occupancy completion is learned in an end-to-end fashion together with the detection of moving objects and the estimation of their motion instantaneously as soon as objects start to move. Extensive experiments demonstrate superior performance compared to standard 3D motion estimation approaches particularly highlighting our method's specialized treatment of subtle motion",

Multiplane image (MPI) is desirable for social media because of its generality but it is complex and computationally expensive making object removal challenging. To address these challenges we propose CORE-MPI which employs embedding images to improve the consistency and accessibility of MPI object removal. CORE-MPI allows for real-time transmission and interaction with embedding images on social media facilitating object removal with a single mask. However recovering the geometric information hidden in the embedding images is a significant challenge. Therefore we propose a dual-network approach where one network focuses on color restoration and the other on inpainting the embedding image including geometric information. For the training of CORE-MPI we introduce a pseudo-reference loss aimed at proficient color recovery even in complex scenes or with large masks. Furthermore we present a disparity consistency loss to preserve the geometric consistency of the inpainted region. We demonstrate the effectiveness of CORE-MPI on RealEstate10K and UCSD datasets",

    "abstract": "In this paper we propose a 3D geometry-aware deformable Gaussian Splatting method for dynamic view synthesis. Existing neural radiance fields (NeRF) based solutions learn the deformation in an implicit manner which cannot incorporate 3D scene geometry. Therefore the learned deformation is not necessarily geometrically coherent which results in unsatisfactory dynamic view synthesis and 3D dynamic reconstruction. Recently 3D Gaussian Splatting provides a new representation of the 3D scene building upon which the 3D geometry could be exploited in learning the complex 3D deformation. Specifically the scenes are represented as a collection of 3D Gaussian where each 3D Gaussian is optimized to move and rotate over time to model the deformation. To enforce the 3D scene geometry constraint during deformation we explicitly extract 3D geometry features and integrate them in learning the 3D deformation. In this way our solution achieves 3D geometry-aware deformation modeling which enables improved dynamic view synthesis and 3D dynamic reconstruction. Extensive experimental results on both synthetic and real datasets prove the superiority of our solution which achieves new state-of-the-art performance.

Existing Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) methods tend to apply computationally heavy and memory-intensive backpropagation-based approaches to handle this. Here we propose a novel method that uses a backpropagation-free approach for TTA for the specific case of 3D data. Our model uses a two-stream architecture to maintain knowledge about the source domain as well as complementary target-domain-specific information. The backpropagation-free property of our model helps address the well-known forgetting problem and mitigates the error accumulation issue. The proposed method also eliminates the need for the usually noisy process of pseudo-labeling and reliance on costly self-supervised training. Moreover our method leverages subspace learning effectively reducing the distribution variance between the two domains. Furthermore the source-domain-specific and the target-domain-specific streams are aligned using a novel entropy-based adaptive fusion strategy.

This paper presents a REsource and ComputAtion-efficient Pruning framework (RECAP) for the finetuning of transformer-based large models. RECAP by design bridges the gap between efficiency and performance through an iterative process cycling between pruning finetuning and updating stages to explore different chunks of the given large-scale model. At each iteration we first prune the model with Taylor-approximation-based importance estimation and then only update a subset of the pruned model weights based on the Fisher-information criterion. In this way RECAP achieves two synergistic and yet conflicting goals: reducing the GPU memory footprint while maintaining model performance unlike most existing pruning methods that require the model to be finetuned beforehand for better preservation of model performance. We perform extensive experiments with a wide range of large transformer-based architectures on various computer vision and natural language understanding tasks. Compared to recent pruning techniques we demonstrate that RECAP offers significant improvements in GPU memory efficiency capable of reducing the footprint by up to 65%",

    "abstract": "Recent advancements have shown the potential of leveraging both point clouds and images to localize anomalies. Nevertheless their applicability in industrial manufacturing is often constrained by significant drawbacks such as the use of memory banks which leads to a substantial increase in terms of memory footprint and inference times. We propose a novel light and fast framework that learns to map features from one modality to the other on nominal samples and detect anomalies by pinpointing inconsistencies between observed and mapped features. Extensive experiments show that our approach achieves state-of-the-art detection and segmentation performance in both the standard and few-shot settings on the MVTec 3D-AD dataset while achieving faster inference and occupying less memory than previous multimodal AD methods. Furthermore we propose a layer pruning technique to improve memory and time efficiency with a marginal sacrifice in performance",

    "abstract": "We aim at finetuning a vision-language model without hurting its out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization. We address two types of OOD generalization i.e. i) domain shift such as natural to sketch images and ii) zero-shot capability to recognize the category that was not contained in the finetune data. Arguably the diminished OOD generalization after finetuning stems from the excessively simplified finetuning target which only provides the class information such as \"a photo of a [CLASS]\". This is distinct from the process in that CLIP was pretrained where there is abundant text supervision with rich semantic information. Therefore we propose to compensate for the finetune process using auxiliary supervision with rich semantic information which acts as anchors to preserve the OOD generalization. Specifically two types of anchors are elaborated in our methods including i) text-compensated anchor which uses the images from the finetune set but enriches the text supervision from a pretrained captioner ii) image-text-pair anchor which is retrieved from the dataset similar to pretraining data of CLIP according to the downstream task associating with the original CLIP text with rich semantics. Those anchors are utilized as auxiliary semantic information to maintain the original feature space of CLIP thereby preserving the OOD generalization capabilities. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves in-distribution performance akin to conventional finetuning while attaining new state-of-the-art results on domain shift and zero-shot learning benchmarks",

    "abstract": "Researchers in natural science need reliable methods for quantifying animal behavior. Recently numerous computer vision methods emerged to automate the process. However observing wild species at remote locations remains a challenging task due to difficult lighting conditions and constraints on power supply and data storage. Event cameras offer unique advantages for battery-dependent remote monitoring due to their low power consumption and high dynamic range capabilities. We use this novel sensor to quantify a behavior in Chinstrap penguins called ecstatic display. We formulate the problem as a temporal action detection task determining the start and end times of the behavior. For this purpose we recorded a colony of breeding penguins in Antarctica for several weeks and labeled event data on 16 nests. The developed method consists of a generator of candidate time intervals (proposals) and a classifier of the actions within them. The experiments show that the event cameras' natural response to motion is effective for continuous behavior monitoring and detection reaching a mean average precision (mAP) of 58% (which increases to 63% in good weather conditions). The results also demonstrate the robustness against various lighting conditions contained in the challenging dataset. The low-power capabilities of the event camera allow it to record significantly longer than with a conventional camera. This work pioneers the use of event cameras for remote wildlife observation opening new interdisciplinary opportunities. https:// tub-rip.github.io/ eventpenguins/",

    "abstract": "Video-based visual relation detection tasks such as video scene graph generation play important roles in fine-grained video understanding. However current video visual relation detection datasets have two main limitations that hinder the progress of research in this area. First they do not explore complex human-human interactions in multi-person scenarios. Second the relation types of existing datasets have relatively low-level semantics and can be often recognized by appearance or simple prior information without the need for detailed spatio-temporal context reasoning. Nevertheless comprehending high-level interactions between humans is crucial for understanding complex multi-person videos such as sports and surveillance videos. To address this issue we propose a new video visual relation detection task: video human-human interaction detection and build a dataset named SportsHHI for it. SportsHHI contains 34 high-level interaction classes from basketball and volleyball sports. 118075 human bounding boxes and 50649 interaction instances are annotated on 11398 keyframes. To benchmark this we propose a two-stage baseline method and conduct extensive experiments to reveal the key factors for a successful human-human interaction detector.

We further introduce Renoised Score Distillation (RSD) a novel score-distillation objective for 2D image resolution. Our RSD combines features from ancestral sampling and Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) to generate sharp images that are also LR-consistent.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Crowd counting is a fundamental problem in crowd analysis which is typically accomplished by estimating a crowd density map and summing over the density values. However this approach suffers from background noise accumulation and loss of density due to the use of broad Gaussian kernels to create the ground truth density maps. This issue can be overcome by narrowing the Gaussian kernel. However existing approaches perform poorly when trained with ground truth density maps with broad kernels. To deal with this limitation we propose using conditional diffusion models to predict density maps as diffusion models show high fidelity to training data during generation. With that we present CrowdDiff that generates the crowd density map as a reverse diffusion process. Furthermore as the intermediate time steps of the diffusion process are noisy we incorporate a regression branch for direct crowd estimation only during training to improve the feature learning. In addition owing to the stochastic nature of the diffusion model we introduce producing multiple density maps to improve the counting performance contrary to the existing crowd counting pipelines. We conduct extensive experiments on publicly available datasets to validate the effectiveness of our method.

While self-supervised pre-training approaches e.g. Masked Autoencoder have shown success in transfer learning task-specific sub-architectures are still required to be appended for different downstream tasks which cannot enjoy the benefits of large-scale pre-training. GLID overcomes this challenge by allowing the pre-trained generalist encoder-decoder to be fine-tuned on various vision tasks with minimal task-specific architecture modifications. In the GLID training scheme pre-training pretext task and other downstream tasks are modeled as \"query-to-answer\" problems including the pre-training pretext task and other downstream tasks. We pre-train a task-agnostic encoder-decoder with query-mask pairs. During fine-tuning GLID maintains the pre-trained encoder-decoder and queries only replacing the topmost linear transformation layer with task-specific linear heads. This minimizes the pretrain-finetune architecture inconsistency and enables the pre-trained model to better adapt to downstream tasks.

This advancement has spurred a growing interest in incorporating specific identities into generated content. Most current methods employ an inversion approach to embed a target visual concept into the text embedding space using a single reference image. However the newly synthesized faces either closely resemble the reference image in terms of facial attributes such as expression or exhibit a reduced capacity for identity preservation. Text descriptions intended to guide the facial attributes of the synthesized face may fall short owing to the intricate entanglement of identity information with identity-irrelevant facial attributes derived from the reference image. To address these issues we present the novel use of the extended StyleGAN embedding space \\mathcal W _+ to achieve enhanced identity preservation and disentanglement for diffusion models.

    "abstract": "Recently convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with large size kernels have attracted much attention in the computer vision field following the success of the Vision Transformers. Large kernel CNNs have been reported to perform well in downstream vision tasks as well as in classification performance. The reason for the high-performance of large kernel CNNs in downstream tasks has been attributed to the large effective receptive field (ERF) produced by large size kernels but this view has not been fully tested. We therefore revisit the performance of large kernel CNNs in downstream task focusing on the weakly supervised object localization (WSOL) task. WSOL a difficult downstream task that is not fully supervised provides a new angle to explore the capabilities of the large kernel CNNs. Our study compares the modern large kernel CNNs ConvNeXt RepLKNet and SLaK to test the validity of the naive expectation that ERF size is important for improving downstream task performance. Our analysis of the factors contributing to high performance provides a different perspective in which the main factor is feature map improvement. Furthermore we find that modern CNNs are robust to the CAM problems of local regions of objects being activated which has long been discussed in WSOL. CAM is the most classic WSOL method but because of the above-mentioned problems it is often used as a baseline method for comparison. However experiments on the CUB-200-2011 dataset show that simply combining a large kernel CNN CAM and simple data augmentation methods can achieve performance (90.99% MaxBoxAcc) comparable to the latest WSOL method which is CNN-based and requires special training or complex post-processing",

Equipped with both of these components our transformer models can outperform all previous methods on ImageNet and reach up to a 4.4% relative improvement over the previous state-of-the-art methods. To further demonstrate the generality of our method we apply it to object detection and image generation whereby we obtain consistent and substantial performance improvements over state-of-the-art.

    "abstract": "We present Cutie a video object segmentation (VOS) network with object-level memory reading which puts the object representation from memory back into the video object segmentation result. Recent works on VOS employ bottom-up pixel-level memory reading which struggles due to matching noise especially in the presence of distractors resulting in lower performance in more challenging data. In contrast Cutie performs top-down object-level memory reading by adapting a small set of object queries. Via those it interacts with the bottom-up pixel features iteratively with a query-based object transformer (qt hence Cutie). The object queries act as a high-level summary of the target object while high-resolution feature maps are retained for accurate segmentation. Together with foreground-background masked attention Cutie cleanly separates the semantics of the foreground object from the background. On the challenging MOSE dataset Cutie improves by 8.7 J&F over XMem with a similar running time and improves by 4.2 J&F over DeAOT while being three times faster.

Despite considerable efforts invested in developing various capture systems and reconstruction algorithms recent advancements still struggle with loose or oversized clothing and overly complex poses. In part this is due to the challenges of acquiring high-quality human datasets. To facilitate the development of these fields in this paper we present PKU-DyMVHumans a versatile human-centric dataset for high-fidelity reconstruction and rendering of dynamic human scenarios from dense multi-view videos. It comprises 8.2 million frames captured by more than 56 synchronized cameras across diverse scenarios. These sequences comprise 32 human subjects across 45 different scenarios each with a high-detailed appearance and realistic human motion. Inspired by recent advancements in neural radiance field (NeRF)-based scene representations we carefully set up an off-the-shelf framework that is easy to provide those state-of-the-art NeRF-based implementations and benchmark on PKU-DyMVHumans dataset. It is paving the way for various applications like fine-grained foreground/background decomposition high-quality human reconstruction and photo-realistic novel view synthesis of a dynamic scene.

In this paper we undertake a comprehensive study of CD-FSS and uncover two crucial insights: (i) the necessity of a fine-tuning stage to effectively transfer the learned meta-knowledge across domains and (ii) the overfitting risk during the naive fine-tuning due to the scarcity of novel category examples. With these insights we propose a novel cross-domain fine-tuning strategy that addresses the challenging CD-FSS tasks. We first design Bi-directional Few-shot Prediction (BFP) which establishes support-query correspondence in a bi-directional manner crafting augmented supervision to reduce the overfitting risk. Then we further extend BFP into Iterative Few-shot Adaptor (IFA) which is a recursive framework to capture the support-query correspondence iteratively targeting maximal exploitation of supervisory signals from the sparse novel category samples. Extensive empirical evaluations show that our method significantly outperforms the state-of-the-arts (+7.8%) which verifies that IFA tackles the cross-domain challenges and mitigates the overfitting simultaneously.

    "abstract": "Deep neural networks have demonstrated remarkable performance in point cloud classification. However previous works show they are vulnerable to adversarial perturbations that can manipulate their predictions. Given the distinctive modality of point clouds various attack strategies have emerged posing challenges for existing defenses to achieve effective generalization. In this study we for the first time introduce causal modeling to enhance the robustness of point cloud classification models. Our insight is from the observation that adversarial examples closely resemble benign point clouds from the human perspective. In our causal modeling we incorporate two critical variables the structural information (standing for the key feature leading to the classification) and the hidden confounders (standing for the noise interfering with the classification). The resulting overall framework CausalPC consists of three sub-modules to identify the causal effect for robust classification. The framework is model-agnostic and adaptable for integration with various point cloud classifiers. Our approach significantly improves the adversarial robustness of three mainstream point cloud classification models on two benchmark datasets. For instance the classification accuracy for DGCNN on ModelNet40 increases from 29.2% to 72.0% with CausalPC whereas the best-performing baseline achieves only 42.4%",

Existing datasets are either synthetic or misaligned restricting the performance of data-driven methods on real data.

To exploit LaRE we propose an Error-Guided feature REfinement module (EGRE) which can refine the image feature guided by LaRE to enhance the discriminativeness of the feature. Our EGRE utilizes an align-then-refine mechanism which effectively refines the image feature for generated-image detection from both spatial and channel perspectives. Extensive experiments on the large-scale GenImage benchmark demonstrate the superiority of our LaRE^2 which surpasses the best SoTA method by up to 11.9%/12.1% average ACC/AP across 8 different image generators.

    "abstract": "This paper endeavors to advance the precision of snapshot compressive imaging (SCI) reconstruction for multispectral image (MSI). To achieve this we integrate the advantageous attributes of established SCI techniques and an image generative model propose a novel structured zero-shot diffusion model dubbed DiffSCI. DiffSCI leverages the structural insights from the deep prior and optimization-based methodologies complemented by the generative capabilities offered by the contemporary denoising diffusion model. Specifically firstly we employ a pre-trained diffusion model which has been trained on a substantial corpus of RGB images as the generative denoiser within the Plug-and-Play framework for the first time. This integration allows for the successful completion of SCI reconstruction especially in the case that current methods struggle to address effectively. Secondly we systematically account for spectral band correlations and introduce a robust methodology to mitigate wavelength mismatch thus enabling seamless adaptation of the RGB diffusion model to MSIs.Thirdly an accelerated algorithm is implemented to expedite the resolution of the data subproblem. This augmentation not only accelerates the convergence rate but also elevates the quality of the reconstruction process.We present extensive testing to show that DiffSCI exhibits discernible performance enhancements over prevailing self-supervised and zero-shot approaches surpassing even supervised transformer counterparts across both simulated and real datasets.

MeLFusion is a text-to-music diffusion model with a novel \"visual synapse\" which effectively infuses the semantics from the visual modality into the generated music.

While data-driven approaches have been used to address this complex problem they suffer from unreliable predictions under distribution shifts during test time. Accordingly several online learning methods have been proposed using regression loss from the ground truth of observed data leveraging the auto-labeling nature of trajectory prediction task. We mainly tackle the following two issues. First previous works underfit and overfit as they only optimize the last layer of motion decoder. To this end we employ the masked autoencoder (MAE) for representation learning to encourage complex interaction modeling in shifted test distribution for updating deeper layers. Second utilizing the sequential nature of driving data we propose an actor-specific token memory that enables the test-time learning of actor-wise motion characteristics. Our proposed method has been validated across various challenging cross-dataset distribution shift scenarios including nuScenes Lyft Waymo and Interaction.

Although numerous TIReID methods have been proposed and achieved promising performance they implicitly assume the training image-text pairs are correctly aligned which is not always the case in real-world scenarios. In practice the image-text pairs inevitably exist under-correlated or even false-correlated a.k.a noisy correspondence (NC) due to the low quality of the images and annotation errors. To address this problem we propose a novel Robust Dual Embedding method (RDE) that can learn robust visual-semantic associations even with NC. Specifically RDE consists of two main components: 1) A Confident Consensus Division (CCD) module that leverages the dual-grained decisions of dual embedding modules to obtain a consensus set of clean training data which enables the model to learn correct and reliable visual-semantic associations. 2) A Triplet Alignment Loss (TAL) relaxes the conventional Triplet Ranking loss with the hardest negative samples to a log-exponential upper bound over all negative ones thus preventing the model collapse under NC and can also focus on hard-negative samples for promising performance. We conduct extensive experiments on three public benchmarks namely CUHK-PEDES ICFG-PEDES and RSTPReID to evaluate the performance and robustness of our RDE.

    "abstract": "In contrast to extensive studies on general vision pre-training for scalable visual autonomous driving remains seldom explored. Visual autonomous driving applications require features encompassing semantics 3D geometry and temporal information simultaneously for joint perception prediction and planning posing dramatic challenges for pre-training. To resolve this we bring up a new pre-training task termed as visual point cloud forecasting - predicting future point clouds from historical visual input. The key merit of this task captures the synergic learning of semantics 3D structures and temporal dynamics. Hence it shows superiority in various downstream tasks. To cope with this new problem we present ViDAR a general model to pre-train downstream visual encoders. It first extracts historical embeddings by the encoder. These representations are then transformed to 3D geometric space via a novel Latent Rendering operator for future point cloud prediction. Experiments show significant gain in downstream tasks e.g. 3.1% NDS on 3D detection 10% error reduction on motion forecasting and 15% less collision rate on planning",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Compared with transferable untargeted attacks transferable targeted adversarial attacks could specify the misclassification categories of adversarial samples posing a greater threat to security-critical tasks. In the meanwhile 3D adversarial samples due to their potential of multi-view robustness can more comprehensively identify weaknesses in existing deep learning systems possessing great application value. However the field of transferable targeted 3D adversarial attacks remains vacant. The goal of this work is to develop a more effective technique that could generate transferable targeted 3D adversarial examples filling the gap in this field. To achieve this goal we design a novel framework named TT3D that could rapidly reconstruct from few multi-view images into Transferable Targeted 3D textured meshes. While existing mesh-based texture optimization methods compute gradients in the high-dimensional mesh space and easily fall into local optima leading to unsatisfactory transferability and distinct distortions TT3D innovatively performs dual optimization towards both feature grid and Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP) parameters in the grid-based NeRF space which significantly enhances black-box transferability while enjoying naturalness. Experimental results show that TT3D not only exhibits superior cross-model transferability but also maintains considerable adaptability across different renders and vision tasks. More importantly we produce 3D adversarial examples with 3D printing techniques in the real world and verify their robust performance under various scenarios",

In particular DIRECT-3D is a tri-plane diffusion model that integrates two innovations: 1) A novel learning framework where noisy data are filtered and aligned automatically during the training process. Specifically after an initial warm-up phase using a small set of clean data an iterative optimization is introduced in the diffusion process to explicitly estimate the 3D pose of objects and select beneficial data based on conditional density. 2) An efficient 3D representation that is achieved by disentangling object geometry and color features with two separate conditional diffusion models that are optimized hierarchically. Given a prompt input our model generates high-quality high-resolution realistic and complex 3D objects with accurate geometric details in seconds. We achieve state-of-the-art performance in both single-class generation and text-to-3D generation.

Although strong in extractive questions current chart visual question answering (chart VQA) models suffer on complex reasoning questions. In this work we address the lack of reasoning ability by data augmentation. We leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) which have shown to have strong reasoning ability as an automatic data annotator that generates question-answer annotations for chart images. The key innovation in our method lies in the Synthesize Step-by-Step strategy: our LLM-based data generator learns to decompose the complex question into step-by-step sub-questions (rationales) which are then used to derive the final answer using external tools i.e. Python. This step-wise generation procedure is trained on synthetic data generated using a template-based QA generation pipeline. Experimental results highlight the significance of the proposed step-by-step generation. By training with the LLM-augmented data (LAMENDA) we significantly enhance the chart VQA models achieving the state-of-the-art accuracy on the ChartQA and PlotQA datasets. In particular our approach improves the accuracy of the previous state-of-the-art approach from 38% to 54% on the human-written questions in the ChartQA dataset which needs strong reasoning.

However previous works that employ LLMs/MLLMs for document understanding have not fully explored and utilized the document layout information which is vital for precise document understanding. In this paper we propose LayoutLLM an LLM/MLLM based method for document understanding. The core of LayoutLLM is a layout instruction tuning strategy which is specially designed to enhance the comprehension and utilization of document layouts. The proposed layout instruction tuning strategy consists of two components: Layout-aware Pre-training and Layout-aware Supervised Fine-tuning. To capture the characteristics of document layout in Layout-aware Pre-training three groups of pre-training tasks corresponding to document-level region-level and segment-level information are introduced. Furthermore a novel module called layout chain-of-thought (LayoutCoT) is devised to enable LayoutLLM to focus on regions relevant to the question and generate accurate answers. LayoutCoT is effective for boosting the performance of document understanding. Meanwhile it brings a certain degree of interpretability which could facilitate manual inspection and correction.

Frequently they infer incorrect labels at coarser taxonomic class levels even when the inference at the leaf level (original class labels) is correct. To address this problem we propose a prompt tuning technique that calibrates the hierarchical consistency of model predictions. A set of metrics of hierarchical consistency the Hierarchical Consistent Accuracy (HCA) and the Mean Treecut Accuracy (MTA) are first proposed to evaluate TOS model performance. A new Prompt Tuning for Hierarchical Consistency (ProTeCt) technique is then proposed to calibrate classification across label set granularities.

As the number of trainable parameters is small (typically in the order of tens of millions) it costs less computation less memory usage and less communication bandwidth resulting in both fast and scalable training. To address the scarcity problem of regional caption data we propose to first pre-train our model on objection detection and segmentation tasks. We call this step weak supervision pretraining since the pretraining data only contains category names instead of full-sentence descriptions. The weak supervision pretraining allows us to leverage many publicly available object detection and segmentation datasets.

Without explicit 3D priors these methods often lead to geometric anomalies and multi-view inconsistency. Recently researchers have attempted to improve the genuineness of 3D objects by directly training on 3D datasets albeit at the cost of low-quality texture generation due to the limited texture diversity in 3D datasets. To harness the advantages of both approaches we propose Bidirectional Diffusion (BiDiff) a unified framework that incorporates both a 3D and a 2D diffusion process to preserve both 3D fidelity and 2D texture richness respectively. Moreover as a simple combination may yield inconsistent generation results we further bridge them with novel bidirectional guidance. In addition our method can be used as an initialization of optimization-based models to further improve the quality of 3D model and efficiency of optimization reducing the process from 3.4 hours to 20 minutes.

Addressing these issues our idea is to extract cross-modality features by CLIP from text and image data naturally related to 3D point clouds. Cross-modality features are used to train a robust 3D scene graph (3DSG) feature extractor. Specifically we propose a novel Cross-Modality Contrastive Learning 3DSGG (CCL-3DSGG) method. Firstly to align the text with 3DSG the text is parsed into word level that are consistent with the 3DSG annotation. To enhance robustness during the alignment adjectives are exchanged for different objects as negative samples. Then to align the image with 3DSG the camera view is treated as a positive sample and other views as negatives. Lastly the recognition of novel object and predicate classes is achieved by calculating the cosine similarity between prompts and 3DSG features.

First the triggers are crafted by perturbing the trajectory of attacking vehicle and then disguised by transforming the scene using a bi-level optimization technique.

We conduct extensive empirical studies using state-of-the-art prediction models on two benchmark datasets using metrics customized for trajectory prediction. We show that the proposed attack is highly effective as it can significantly hinder the performance of prediction models unnoticeable by the victims and efficient as it forces the victim to generate malicious behavior even under constrained conditions.

Then we customize a pretrained text-to-image model to generate texture map with template structure while preserving the natural 2D image knowledge. Furthermore to enhance fine-grained details we propose a novel adversarial learning scheme to shorten the domain gap between original dataset and realistic texture domain. Extensive experiments show that our approach outperforms current texture generation methods resulting in efficient character texturing and faithful generation with prompts. Besides we showcase various applications such as out of domain generation and texture stylization. We also provide an efficient generation system for automatic text-guided textured character generation and animation",

    "abstract": "Point cloud filtering is a fundamental 3D vision task which aims to remove noise while recovering the underlying clean surfaces. State-of-the-art methods remove noise by moving noisy points along stochastic trajectories to the clean surfaces. These methods often require regularization within the training objective and/or during post-processing to ensure fidelity. In this paper we introduce StraightPCF a new deep learning based method for point cloud filtering. It works by moving noisy points along straight paths thus reducing discretization errors while ensuring faster convergence to the clean surfaces. We model noisy patches as intermediate states between high noise patch variants and their clean counterparts and design the VelocityModule to infer a constant flow velocity from the former to the latter. This constant flow leads to straight filtering trajectories. In addition we introduce a DistanceModule that scales the straight trajectory using an estimated distance scalar to attain convergence near the clean surface. Our network is lightweight and only has 530K parameters being 17% of IterativePFN (a most recent point cloud filtering network). Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world data show our method achieves state-of-the-art results. Our method also demonstrates nice distributions of filtered points without the need for regularization. The implementation code can be found at: https://github.com/ddsediri/StraightPCF",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "One of the main challenges of multimodal learning is the need to combine heterogeneous modalities (e.g. video audio text). For example video and audio are obtained at much higher rates than text and are roughly aligned in time. They are often not synchronized with text which comes as a global context e.g. a title or a description. Furthermore video and audio inputs are of much larger volumes and grow as the video length increases which naturally requires more compute dedicated to these modalities and makes modeling of long-range dependencies harder. We here decouple the multimodal modeling dividing it into separate autoregressive models processing the inputs according to the characteristics of the modalities. We propose a multimodal model consisting of an autoregressive component for the time-synchronized modalities (audio and video) and an autoregressive component for the context modalities which are not necessarily aligned in time but are still sequential. To address the long-sequences of the video-audio inputs we further partition the video and audio sequences in consecutive snippets and autoregressively process their representations. To that end we propose a Combiner mechanism which models the audio-video information jointly producing compact but expressive representations. This allows us to scale to 512 input video frames without increase in model parameters. Our approach achieves the state-of-the-art on multiple well established multimodal benchmarks. It effectively addresses the high computational demand of media inputs by learning compact representations controlling the sequence length of the audio-video feature representations and modeling their dependencies in time",

Then the high-level motion semantics are incorporated into the motion retargeting process by feeding the vision-language model with the rendered images and aligning the extracted semantic embeddings.

Motivated by this we propose incrementally tuning the shared adapter without imposing parameter update constraints enhancing the learning capacity of the backbone. Additionally we employ feature sampling from stored prototypes to retrain a unified classifier further improving its performance. We estimate the semantic shift of old prototypes without access to past samples and update stored prototypes session by session.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Training deep models for LiDAR semantic segmentation is challenging due to the inherent sparsity of point clouds. Utilizing temporal data is a natural remedy against the sparsity problem as it makes the input signal denser. However previous multi-frame fusion algorithms fall short in utilizing sufficient temporal information due to the memory constraint and they also ignore the informative temporal images. To fully exploit rich information hidden in long-term temporal point clouds and images we present the Temporal Aggregation Network termed TASeg. Specifically we propose a Temporal LiDAR Aggregation and Distillation (TLAD) algorithm which leverages historical priors to assign different aggregation steps for different classes. It can largely reduce memory and time overhead while achieving higher accuracy. Besides TLAD trains a teacher injected with gt priors to distill the model further boosting the performance. To make full use of temporal images we design a Temporal Image Aggregation and Fusion (TIAF) module which can greatly expand the camera FOV and enhance the present features. Temporal LiDAR points in the camera FOV are used as mediums to transform temporal image features to the present coordinate for temporal multi-modal fusion. Moreover we develop a Static-Moving Switch Augmentation (SMSA) algorithm which utilizes sufficient temporal information to enable objects to switch their motion states freely thus greatly increasing static and moving training samples. Our TASeg ranks 1st on three challenging tracks i.e. SemanticKITTI single-scan track multi-scan track and nuScenes LiDAR segmentation track strongly demonstrating the superiority of our method.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "The recently proposed SparseFormer architecture provides an alternative approach to visual understanding by utilizing a significantly lower number of visual tokens via adjusting RoIs greatly reducing computational costs while still achieving promising performance. However training SparseFormers from scratch is still expensive and scaling up the number of parameters can be challenging. In this paper we propose to bootstrap SparseFormers from ViT-based vision foundation models in a simple and efficient way. Since the majority of SparseFormer blocks are the standard transformer ones we can inherit weights from large-scale pre-trained vision transformers and freeze them as much as possible. Therefore we only need to train the SparseFormer-specific lightweight focusing transformer to adjust token RoIs and fine-tune a few early pre-trained blocks to align the final token representation. In such a way we can bootstrap SparseFormer architectures from various large-scale pre-trained models (e.g. IN-21K pre-trained AugRegs or CLIPs) using a rather smaller amount of training samples (e.g. IN-1K) and without labels or captions within just a few hours. As a result the bootstrapped unimodal SparseFormer (from AugReg-ViT-L/16-384) can reach 84.9% accuracy on IN-1K with only 49 tokens and the multimodal SparseFormer from CLIPs also demonstrates notable zero-shot performance with highly reduced computational cost without seeing any caption during the bootstrapping procedure. In addition CLIP-bootstrapped SparseFormers which align the output space with language without seeing a word can serve as efficient vision encoders in multimodal large language models.

    "abstract": "End-to-end motion planning models equipped with deep neural networks have shown great potential for enabling full autonomous driving. However the oversized neural networks render them impractical for deployment on resource-constrained systems which unavoidably requires more computational time and resources during reference. To handle this knowledge distillation offers a promising approach that compresses models by enabling a smaller student model to learn from a larger teacher model. Nevertheless how to apply knowledge distillation to compress motion planners has not been explored so far. In this paper we propose PlanKD the first knowledge distillation framework tailored for compressing end-to-end motion planners. First considering that driving scenes are inherently complex often containing planning-irrelevant or even noisy information transferring such information is not beneficial for the student planner. Thus we design an information bottleneck based strategy to only distill planning-relevant information rather than transfer all information indiscriminately. Second different waypoints in an output planned trajectory may hold varying degrees of importance for motion planning where a slight deviation in certain crucial waypoints might lead to a collision. Therefore we devise a safety-aware waypoint-attentive distillation module that assigns adaptive weights to different waypoints based on the importance to encourage the student to accurately mimic more crucial waypoints thereby improving overall safety. Experiments demonstrate that our PlanKD can boost the performance of smaller planners by a large margin and significantly reduce their reference time",

How to improve token representation and optimize token decoding presents significant challenges. This paper introduces PredToken a novel predictive framework that addresses these issues by decoupling space-time tokens into distinct components for iterative cascaded decoding. Concretely we first design a \"decomposition quantization and reconstruction\" schema based on VQGAN to improve the token representation. This scheme disentangles low- and high-frequency representations and employs a dimension-aware quantization model allowing more low-level details to be preserved. Building on this we present a \"coarse-to-fine iterative decoding\" method. It leverages dynamic soft decoding to refine coarse tokens and static soft decoding for fine tokens enabling more high-level dynamics to be captured.

In this paper we develop an efficient and effective video-based human pose regression method which bypasses intermediate representations such as heatmaps and instead directly maps the input to the output joint coordinates. Despite the inherent spatial correlation among adjacent joints of the human pose the temporal trajectory of each individual joint exhibits relative independence. In light of this we propose a novel Decoupled Space-Time Aggregation network (DSTA) to separately capture the spatial contexts between adjacent joints and the temporal cues of each individual joint thereby avoiding the conflation of spatiotemporal dimensions. Concretely DSTA learns a dedicated feature token for each joint to facilitate the modeling of their spatiotemporal dependencies. With the proposed joint-wise local-awareness attention mechanism our method is capable of efficiently and flexibly utilizing the spatial dependency of adjacent joints and the temporal dependency of each joint itself. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method. Compared to previous regression-based single-frame human pose estimation methods DSTA significantly enhances performance achieving an 8.9 mAP improvement on PoseTrack2017. Furthermore our approach either surpasses or is on par with the state-of-the-art heatmap-based multi-frame human pose estimation methods. Project page: https://github.com/zgspose/DSTA",

    "abstract": "In the current era of generative AI breakthroughs generating panoramic scenes from a single input image remains a key challenge. Most existing methods use diffusion-based iterative or simultaneous multi-view inpainting. However the lack of global scene layout priors leads to subpar outputs with duplicated objects (e.g. multiple beds in a bedroom) or requires time-consuming human text inputs for each view. We propose L-MAGIC a novel method leveraging large language models for guidance while diffusing multiple coherent views of 360 degree panoramic scenes. L-MAGIC harnesses pre-trained diffusion and language models without fine-tuning ensuring zero-shot performance. The output quality is further enhanced by super-resolution and multi-view fusion techniques. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the resulting panoramic scenes feature better scene layouts and perspective view rendering quality compared to related works with >70% preference in human evaluations. Combined with conditional diffusion models L-MAGIC can accept various input modalities including but not limited to text depth maps sketches and colored scripts. Applying depth estimation further enables 3D point cloud generation and dynamic scene exploration with fluid camera motion",

Because such methods are expensive and due to the widespread availability of 2D videos recent methods have focused on how to perform monocular 3D face tracking. However these methods often fall short in capturing precise facial movements due to limitations in their network architecture training and evaluation processes. Addressing these challenges we propose a novel face tracker FlowFace that introduces an innovative 2D alignment network for dense per-vertex alignment. Unlike prior work FlowFace is trained on high-quality 3D scan annotations rather than weak supervision or synthetic data. Our 3D model fitting module jointly fits a 3D face model from one or many observations integrating existing neutral shape priors for enhanced identity and expression disentanglement and per-vertex deformations for detailed facial feature reconstruction. Additionally we propose a novel metric and benchmark for assessing tracking accuracy. Our method exhibits superior performance on both custom and publicly available benchmarks.

    "abstract": "Multi-view diffusion models obtained by applying Supervised Finetuning (SFT) to text-to-image diffusion models have driven recent breakthroughs in text-to-3D research. However due to the limited size and quality of existing 3D datasets they still suffer from multi-view inconsistencies and Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) reconstruction artifacts. We argue that multi-view diffusion models can benefit from further Reinforcement Learning Finetuning (RLFT) which allows models to learn from the data generated by themselves and improve beyond their dataset limitations during SFT. To this end we introduce Carve3D an improved RLFT algorithm coupled with a novel Multi-view Reconstruction Consistency (MRC) metric to enhance the consistency of multi-view diffusion models. To measure the MRC metric on a set of multi-view images we compare them with their corresponding NeRF renderings at the same camera viewpoints. The resulting model which we denote as Carve3DM demonstrates superior multi-view consistency and NeRF reconstruction quality than existing models. Our results suggest that pairing SFT with Carve3D's RLFT is essential for developing multi-view-consistent diffusion models mirroring the standard Large Language Model (LLM) alignment pipeline.

    "abstract": "Vision Transformers (ViTs) have emerged as a compelling alternative to Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) in the realm of computer vision showcasing tremendous potential. However recent research has unveiled a susceptibility of ViTs to adversarial attacks akin to their CNN counterparts. Adversarial training and randomization are two representative effective defenses for CNNs. Some researchers have attempted to apply adversarial training to ViTs and achieved comparable robustness to CNNs while it is not easy to directly apply randomization to ViTs because of the architecture difference between CNNs and ViTs. In this paper we delve into the structural intricacies of ViTs and propose a novel defense mechanism termed Random entangled image Transformer (ReiT) which seamlessly integrates adversarial training and randomization to bolster the adversarial robustness of ViTs. Recognizing the challenge posed by the structural disparities between ViTs and CNNs we introduce a novel module input-independent random entangled self-attention (II-ReSA). This module optimizes random entangled tokens that lead to \"dissimilar\" self-attention outputs by leveraging model parameters and the sampled random tokens thereby synthesizing the self-attention module outputs and random entangled tokens to diminish adversarial similarity. ReiT incorporates two distinct random entangled tokens and employs dual randomization offering an effective countermeasure against adversarial examples while ensuring comprehensive deduction guarantees. Through extensive experiments conducted on various ViT variants and benchmarks we substantiate the superiority of our proposed method in enhancing the adversarial robustness of Vision Transformers",

    "abstract": "Generative AI has made significant strides in computer vision particularly in text-driven image/video synthesis (T2I/T2V). Despite the notable advancements it remains challenging in human-centric content synthesis such as realistic dance generation. Current methodologies primarily tailored for human motion transfer encounter difficulties when confronted with real-world dance scenarios (e.g. social media dance) which require to generalize across a wide spectrum of poses and intricate human details. In this paper we depart from the traditional paradigm of human motion transfer and emphasize two additional critical attributes for the synthesis of human dance content in social media contexts: (i) Generalizability: the model should be able to generalize beyond generic human viewpoints as well as unseen human subjects backgrounds and poses; (ii) Compositionality: it should allow for the seamless composition of seen/unseen subjects backgrounds and poses from different sources. To address these challenges we introduce DISCO which includes a novel model architecture with disentangled control to improve the compositionality of dance synthesis and an effective human attribute pre-training for better generalizability to unseen humans. Extensive qualitative and quantitative results demonstrate that DISCO can generate high-quality human dance images and videos with diverse appearances and flexible motions.

    "abstract": "Deep neural networks have shown great success in representation learning. Deep neural networks have shown great success in representation learning. However when learning with noisy labels (LNL) they can easily overfit and fail to generalize to new data. This paper introduces a simple and effective method named Learning to Bootstrap (L2B) which enables models to bootstrap themselves using their own predictions without being adversely affected by erroneous pseudo-labels. It achieves this by dynamically adjusting the importance weight between real observed and generated labels as well as between different samples through meta-learning. Unlike existing instance reweighting methods the key to our method lies in a new versatile objective that enables implicit relabeling concurrently leading to significant improvements without incurring additional costs. L2B offers several benefits over the baseline methods. It yields more robust models that are less susceptible to the impact of noisy labels by guiding the bootstrapping procedure more effectively. It better exploits the valuable information contained in corrupted instances by adapting the weights of both instances and labels. Furthermore L2B is compatible with existing LNL methods and delivers competitive results spanning natural and medical imaging tasks including classification and segmentation under both synthetic and real-world noise. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method effectively mitigates the challenges of noisy labels often necessitating few to no validation samples and is well generalized to other tasks such as image segmentation. This not only positions it as a robust complement to existing LNL techniques but also underscores its practical applicability. The code and models are available at https://github.com/yuyinzhou/l2b",

Autofocus control (AC) plays a pivotal role in a camera to efficiently capture information in challenging real-world scenarios. Nevertheless due to disparities in data modality and information characteristics compared to frame stream and event stream the current lack of efficient AC methods has made it challenging for spike cameras to adapt to intricate real-world conditions. To address this challenge we introduce a spike-based autofocus framework that includes a spike-specific focus measure called spike dispersion (SD) which effectively mitigates the influence of variations in scene light intensity during the focusing process by leveraging the spike camera's ability to record full-time spatial light intensity. Additionally the framework integrates a fast search strategy called spike-based golden fast search (SGFS) allowing rapid focal positioning without the need for a complete focus range traversal. To validate the performance of our method we have collected a spike-based autofocus dataset (SAD) containing synthetic data and real-world data under varying scene brightness and motion scenarios.

Although fairness has been investigated in the vision-only domain the fairness of medical vision-language (VL) models remains unexplored due to the scarcity of medical VL datasets for studying fairness. To bridge this research gap we introduce the first fair vision-language medical dataset (Harvard-FairVLMed) that provides detailed demographic attributes ground-truth labels and clinical notes to facilitate an in-depth examination of fairness within VL foundation models. Using Harvard-FairVLMed we conduct a comprehensive fairness analysis of two widely-used VL models (CLIP and BLIP2) pre-trained on both natural and medical domains across four different protected attributes. Our results highlight significant biases in all VL models with Asian Male Non-Hispanic and Spanish being the preferred subgroups across the protected attributes of race gender ethnicity and language respectively. In order to alleviate these biases we propose FairCLIP an optimal-transport-based approach that achieves a favorable trade-off between performance and fairness by reducing the Sinkhorn distance between the overall sample distribution and the distributions corresponding to each demographic group.

It leverages a foundational image model as an artificial oracle within the active learning context eliminating the need for manual annotation by a human oracle.

The REAL framework samples query points based on model predictions and requests annotations from PP2S dynamically refining labels and improving model training. Furthermore to overcome several challenges of employing an artificial model as an oracle we formulate effective query sampling and label updating strategies.

    "abstract": "Although neural networks excel in video action recognition tasks their \"black-box\" nature makes it challenging to understand the rationale behind their decisions. Recent approaches used inherently interpretable models to analyze video actions in a manner akin to human reasoning. However it has been observed that these interpretable models tend to underperform when compared to their black-box counterparts. In this work we present a new framework called Language-guided Interpretable Action Recognition framework (LaIAR). This framework leverages knowledge from language models to enhance both the recognition capabilities and the interpretability of video models. In essence we reframe the challenge of understanding video model decisions as a task of aligning video and language models. Using the logical reasoning captured by the language model we steer the training of the video model. This integrated approach not only improves the video model's adaptability to different domains but also boosts its overall performance. Extensive experiments on Charades and CAD-120 datasets demonstrate the superior performance and interpretability of our proposed method.

    "title": "Forecasting of 3D Whole-body Human Poses with Grasping Objects",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "In the context of computer vision and human-robot interaction forecasting 3D human poses is crucial for understanding human behavior and enhancing the predictive capabilities of intelligent systems. While existing methods have made significant progress they often focus on predicting major body joints overlooking fine-grained gestures and their interaction with objects. Human hand movements particularly during object interactions play a pivotal role and provide more precise expressions of human poses. This work fills this gap and introduces a novel paradigm: forecasting 3D whole-body human poses with a focus on grasping objects. This task involves predicting activities across all joints in the body and hands encompassing the complexities of internal heterogeneity and external interactivity. To tackle these challenges we also propose a novel approach: C^3HOST cross-context cross-modal consolidation for 3D whole-body pose forecasting effectively handles the complexities of internal heterogeneity and external interactivity. C^3HOST involves distinct steps including the heterogeneous content encoding and alignment and cross-modal feature learning and interaction. These enable us to predict activities across all body and hand joints ensuring high-precision whole-body human pose prediction even during object grasping. Extensive experiments on two benchmarks demonstrate that our model significantly enhances the accuracy of whole-body human motion prediction.

To achieve this current works try to construct a Tri-Perspective View (TPV) or Occupancy (OCC) representation extending from the Bird-Eye-View perception. However compressed views like TPV representation lose 3D geometry information while raw and sparse OCC representation requires heavy but redundant computational costs. To address the above limitations we propose Compact Occupancy TRansformer (COTR) with a geometry-aware occupancy encoder and a semantic-aware group decoder to reconstruct a compact 3D OCC representation. The occupancy encoder first generates a compact geometrical OCC feature through efficient explicit-implicit view transformation. Then the occupancy decoder further enhances the semantic discriminability of the compact OCC representation by a coarse-to-fine semantic grouping strategy. Empirical experiments show that there are evident performance gains across multiple baselines e.g. COTR outperforms baselines with a relative improvement of 8%-15% demonstrating the superiority of our method",

Recent advancements in high-order numerical ODE solvers for DPMs have enabled the generation of high-quality images with much fewer sampling steps. While this is a significant development most sampling methods still employ uniform time steps which is not optimal when using a small number of steps. To address this issue we propose a general framework for designing an optimization problem that seeks more appropriate time steps for a specific numerical ODE solver for DPMs. This optimization problem aims to minimize the distance between the ground-truth solution to the ODE and an approximate solution corresponding to the numerical solver. It can be efficiently solved using the constrained trust region method taking less than 15 seconds. Our extensive experiments on both unconditional and conditional sampling using pixel- and latent-space DPMs demonstrate that when combined with the state-of-the-art sampling method UniPC our optimized time steps significantly improve image generation performance in terms of FID scores for datasets such as CIFAR-10 and ImageNet compared to using uniform time steps",

We observe that existing methods that fine-tune an LMM to segment images significantly degrade their ability to reliably determine (\"see\") if an object is present and to interact naturally with humans (\"say\") a form of catastrophic forgetting. In this work we propose a cascading and joint training approach for LMMs to solve this task avoiding catastrophic forgetting of previous skills. Our resulting model can \"see\" by detecting whether objects are present in an image \"say\" by telling the user if they are not proposing alternative queries or correcting semantic errors in the query and finally \"segment\" by outputting the mask of the desired objects if they exist. Additionally we introduce a novel False Premise Correction benchmark dataset an extension of existing RefCOCO(+/g) referring segmentation datasets (which we call FP-RefCOCO(+/g)). The results show that our method not only detects false premises up to 55% better than existing approaches but under false premise conditions produces relative cIOU improvements of more than 31% over baselines and produces natural language feedback judged helpful up to 67% of the time",

    "abstract": "End-to-end autonomous driving recently emerged as a promising research direction to target autonomy from a full-stack perspective. Along this line many of the latest works follow an open-loop evaluation setting on nuScenes to study the planning behavior. In this paper we delve deeper into the problem by conducting thorough analyses and demystifying more devils in the details. We initially observed that the nuScenes dataset characterized by relatively simple driving scenarios leads to an under-utilization of perception information in end-to-end models incorporating ego status such as the ego vehicle's velocity. These models tend to rely predominantly on the ego vehicle's status for future path planning. Beyond the limitations of the dataset we also note that current metrics do not comprehensively assess the planning quality leading to potentially biased conclusions drawn from existing benchmarks. To address this issue we introduce a new metric to evaluate whether the predicted trajectories adhere to the road. We further propose a simple baseline able to achieve competitive results without relying on perception annotations. Given the current limitations on the benchmark and metrics we suggest the community reassess relevant prevailing research and be cautious about whether the continued pursuit of state-of-the-art would yield convincing and universal conclusions.

In response we present Contrasting Gradient Inversion for Diffusion Models (CGI-DM) a novel method featuring vivid visual representations for digital copyright authentication. Our approach involves removing partial information of an image and recovering missing details by exploiting conceptual differences between the pre-trained and fine-tuned models. We formulate the differences as KL divergence between latent variables of the two models when given the same input image which can be maximized through Monte Carlo sampling and Projected Gradient Descent (PGD). The similarity between original and recovered images serves as a strong indicator of potential infringements.

    "abstract": "Visual perception evolves over time. This is particularly the case of oracle bone scripts where visual glyphs seem intuitive to people from distant past prove difficult to be understood in contemporary eyes. While semantic correspondence of an oracle can be found via a dictionary lookup this proves to be not enough for public viewers to connect the dots i.e. why does this oracle mean that? Common solution relies on a laborious curation process to collect visual guide for each oracle (Fig.1) which hinges on the case-by-case effort and taste of curators. This paper delves into one natural follow-up question: can AI take over?Begin with a comprehensive human study we show participants could indeed make better sense of an oracle glyph subjected to a proper visual guide and its efficacy can be approximated via a novel metric termed TransOV (Transferable Oracle Visuals). We then define a new conditional visual generation task based on an oracle glyph and its semantic meaning and importantly approach it by circumventing any form of model training in the presence of fatal lack of oracle data. At its heart is to leverage foundation model like GPT-4V to reason about the visual cues hidden inside an oracle and take advantage of an existing text-to-image model for final visual guide generation. Extensive empirical evidence shows our AI-enabled visual guides achieve significantly comparable TransOV performance compared with those collected under manual efforts. Finally we demonstrate the versatility of our system under a more complex setting where it is required to work alongside an AI image denoiser to cope with raw oracle scan image inputs (cf. processed clean oracle glyphs).

In contrast we consider a novel formulation involving constraints on image points the unknown depths of 3D points and a partially specified calibration matrix K. For 2 and 3 views we present a comprehensive taxonomy of minimal autocalibration problems obtained by relaxing some of these constraints. These problems are organized into classes according to the number of views and any assumed prior knowledge of K. Within each class we determine problems with the fewest---or a relatively small number of---solutions. From this zoo of problems we devise three practical solvers.

Second in the real-world finetuning stage MOHO leverages the amodal-mask-weighted geometric supervision to mitigate the unfaithful guidance caused by the hand-occluded supervising views in real world. Moreover domain-consistent occlusion-aware features are amalgamated in MOHO to resist object's self-occlusion for inferring the complete object shape.

We propose an adaptation method which does not backpropagate gradients through the backbone. We achieve this by designing a lightweight network in parallel that operates on features from the frozen pretrained backbone. As a result our method is efficient not only in terms of parameters but also in training-time and memory usage. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art accuracy-parameter trade-offs on the popular VTAB benchmark and we further show how we outperform prior works with respect to training-time and -memory usage too. We further demonstrate the training efficiency and scalability of our method by adapting a vision transformer backbone of 4 billion parameters for the computationally demanding task of video classification without any intricate model parallelism. Here we outperform a prior adaptor-based method which could only scale to a 1 billion parameter backbone or fully-finetuning a smaller backbone with the same GPU and less training time",

To address this issue we present SecondPose a novel approach integrating object-specific geometric features with semantic category priors from DINOv2. Leveraging the advantage of DINOv2 in providing SE(3)-consistent semantic features we hierarchically extract two types of SE(3)-invariant geometric features to further encapsulate local-to-global object-specific information. These geometric features are then point-aligned with DINOv2 features to establish a consistent object representation under SE(3) transformations facilitating the mapping from camera space to the pre-defined canonical space thus further enhancing pose estimation. Extensive experiments on NOCS-REAL275 demonstrate that SecondPose achieves a 12.4% leap forward over the state-of-the-art.

    "abstract": "Can computers perceive the physical properties of objects solely through vision? Research in cognitive science and vision science has shown that humans excel at identifying materials and estimating their physical properties based purely on visual appearance. In this paper we present a novel approach for dense prediction of the physical properties of objects using a collection of images. Inspired by how humans reason about physics through vision we leverage large language models to propose candidate materials for each object. We then construct a language-embedded point cloud and estimate the physical properties of each 3D point using a zero-shot kernel regression approach. Our method is accurate annotation-free and applicable to any object in the open world. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in various physical property reasoning tasks such as estimating the mass of common objects as well as other properties like friction and hardness",

    "abstract": "Understanding the world in first-person view is fundamental in Augmented Reality (AR). This immersive perspective brings dramatic visual changes and unique challenges compared to third-person views. Synthetic data has empowered third-person-view vision models but its application to embodied egocentric perception tasks remains largely unexplored. A critical challenge lies in simulating natural human movements and behaviors that effectively steer the embodied cameras to capture a faithful egocentric representation of the 3D world. To address this challenge we introduce EgoGen a new synthetic data generator that can produce accurate and rich ground-truth training data for egocentric perception tasks. At the heart of EgoGen is a novel human motion synthesis model that directly leverages egocentric visual inputs of a virtual human to sense the 3D environment. Combined with collision-avoiding motion primitives and a two-stage reinforcement learning approach our motion synthesis model offers a closed-loop solution where the embodied perception and movement of the virtual human are seamlessly coupled. Compared to previous works our model eliminates the need for a pre-defined global path and is directly applicable to dynamic environments. Combined with our easy-to-use and scalable data generation pipeline we demonstrate EgoGen's efficacy in three tasks: mapping and localization for head-mounted cameras egocentric camera tracking and human mesh recovery from egocentric views. EgoGen will be fully open-sourced offering a practical solution for creating realistic egocentric training data and aiming to serve as a useful tool for egocentric computer vision research",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Face Anti-Spoofing (FAS) is crucial for securing face recognition systems against presentation attacks. With advancements in sensor manufacture and multi-modal learning techniques many multi-modal FAS approaches have emerged. However they face challenges in generalizing to unseen attacks and deployment conditions. These challenges arise from (1) modality unreliability where some modality sensors like depth and infrared undergo significant domain shifts in varying environments leading to the spread of unreliable information during cross-modal feature fusion and (2) modality imbalance where training overly relies on a dominant modality hinders the convergence of others reducing effectiveness against attack types that are indistinguishable by sorely using the dominant modality. To address modality unreliability we propose the Uncertainty-Guided Cross-Adapter (U-Adapter) to recognize unreliably detected regions within each modality and suppress the impact of unreliable regions on other modalities. For modality imbalance we propose a Rebalanced Modality Gradient Modulation (ReGrad) strategy to rebalance the convergence speed of all modalities by adaptively adjusting their gradients. Besides we provide the first large-scale benchmark for evaluating multi-modal FAS performance under domain generalization scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods. Source codes and protocols are released on https://github.com/OMGGGGG/mmdg",

    "abstract": "The remarkable success of \"pretrain-then-finetune\" paradigm has led to a proliferation of available pre-trained models for vision tasks. This surge presents a significant challenge in efficiently choosing the most suitable pre-trained models for downstream tasks. The critical aspect of this challenge lies in effectively predicting the model transferability by considering the underlying fine-tuning dynamics. Existing methods often model fine-tuning dynamics in feature space with linear transformations which do not precisely align with the fine-tuning objective and fail to grasp the essential nonlinearity from optimization. To this end we present LEAD a finetuning-aligned approach based on the network output of logits. LEAD proposes a theoretical framework to model the optimization process and derives an ordinary differential equation (ODE) to depict the nonlinear evolution toward the final logit state. Additionally we design a class-aware decomposition method to consider the varying evolution dynamics across classes and further ensure practical applicability. Integrating the closely aligned optimization objective and nonlinear modeling capabilities derived from the differential equation our method offers a concise solution to effectively bridge the optimization gap in a single step bypassing the lengthy fine-tuning process. The comprehensive experiments on 24 supervised and self-supervised pre-trained models across 10 downstream datasets demonstrate impressive performances and showcase its broad adaptability even in low-data scenarios",

We propose Video ReCap a recursive video captioning model that can process video inputs of dramatically different lengths (from 1 second to 2 hours) and output video captions at multiple hierarchy levels. The recursive video-language architecture exploits the synergy between different video hierarchies and can process hour-long videos efficiently. We utilize a curriculum learning training scheme to learn the hierarchical structure of videos starting from clip-level captions describing atomic actions then focusing on segment-level descriptions and concluding with generating summaries for hour-long videos. Furthermore we introduce Ego4D-HCap dataset by augmenting Ego4D with 8267 manually collected long-range video summaries. Our recursive model can flexibly generate captions at different hierarchy levels while also being useful for other complex video understanding tasks such as VideoQA on EgoSchema.

    "abstract": "Diffusion models (DMs) excel in photo-realistic image synthesis but their adaptation to LiDAR scene generation poses a substantial hurdle. This is primarily because DMs operating in the point space struggle to preserve the curve-like patterns and 3D geometry of LiDAR scenes which consumes much of their representation power. In this paper we propose LiDAR Diffusion Models (LiDMs) to generate LiDAR-realistic scenes from a latent space tailored to capture the realism of LiDAR scenes by incorporating geometric priors into the learning pipeline. Our method targets three major desiderata: pattern realism geometry realism and object realism. Specifically we introduce curve-wise compression to simulate real-world LiDAR patterns point-wise coordinate supervision to learn scene geometry and patch-wise encoding for a full 3D object context. With these three core designs our method achieves competitive performance on unconditional LiDAR generation in 64-beam scenario and state of the art on conditional LiDAR generation while maintaining high efficiency compared to point-based DMs (up to 107xfaster). Furthermore by compressing LiDAR scenes into a latent space we enable the controllability of DMs with various conditions such as semantic maps camera views and text prompts.

Our key idea is to solve this blind inverse problem in the reflectance map an appearance representation invariant to the underlying geometry by learning to reverse the image formation with a novel diffusion model which we refer to as the Diffusion Reflectance Map Network (DRMNet). Given an observed reflectance map converted and completed from the single input image DRMNet generates a reflectance map corresponding to a perfect mirror sphere while jointly estimating the reflectance. The forward process can be understood as gradually filtering a natural illumination with lower and lower frequency reflectance and additive Gaussian noise. DRMNet learns to invert this process with two subnetworks IllNet and RefNet which work in concert towards this joint estimation. The network is trained on an extensive synthetic dataset and is demonstrated to generalize to real images showing state-of-the-art accuracy on established datasets",

Although some attempts have been made for unifying different segmentation tasks or generalization to various scenarios limitations in the definition of paradigms and input-output spaces make it difficult for them to achieve accurate understanding of content at arbitrary granularity. To this end we present UniLSeg a universal segmentation model that can perform segmentation at any semantic level with the guidance of language instructions.

Conventional diffusion-based methods for scene text generation are typically limited by their reliance on an intermediate layout output.

To address these challenges this paper introduces SceneTextGen a novel diffusion-based model specifically designed to circumvent the need for a predefined layout stage. By doing so SceneTextGen facilitates a more natural and varied representation of text. The novelty of SceneTextGen lies in its integration of three key components: a character-level encoder for capturing detailed typographic properties coupled with a character-level instance segmentation model and a word-level spotting model to address the issues of unwanted text generation and minor character inaccuracies.

This results in limited control and compromised background content preservation. To overcome these limitations we introduce SmartMask which allows any novice user to create detailed masks for precise object insertion. Combined with a ControlNet-Inpaint model our experiments demonstrate that SmartMask achieves superior object insertion quality preserving the background content more effectively than previous methods. Notably unlike prior works the proposed approach can also be used even without user-mask guidance which allows it to perform mask-free object insertion at diverse positions and scales. Furthermore we find that when used iteratively with a novel instruction-tuning based planning model SmartMask can be used to design detailed layouts from scratch.

    "abstract": "Recently impressive results have been achieved in 3D scene editing with text instructions based on a 2D diffusion model. However current diffusion models primarily generate images by predicting noise in the latent space and the editing is usually applied to the whole image which makes it challenging to perform delicate especially localized editing for 3D scenes. Inspired by recent 3D Gaussian splatting we propose a systematic framework named GaussianEditor to edit 3D scenes delicately via 3D Gaussians with text instructions. Benefiting from the explicit property of 3D Gaussians we design a series of techniques to achieve delicate editing. Specifically we first extract the region of interest (RoI) corresponding to the text instruction aligning it to 3D Gaussians. The Gaussian RoI is further used to control the editing process. Our framework can achieve more delicate and precise editing of 3D scenes than previous methods while enjoying much faster training speed i.e. within 20 minutes on a single V100 GPU more than twice as fast as Instruct-NeRF2NeRF (45 minutes -- 2 hours).

    "title": "MemFlow: Optical Flow Estimation and Prediction with Memory",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Optical flow is a classical task that is important to the vision community. Classical optical flow estimation uses two frames as input whilst some recent methods consider multiple frames to explicitly model long-range information. The former ones limit their ability to fully leverage temporal coherence along the video sequence; and the latter ones incur heavy computational overhead typically not possible for real-time flow estimation. Some multi-frame-based approaches even necessitate unseen future frames for current estimation compromising real-time applicability in safety-critical scenarios. To this end we present MemFlow a real-time method for optical flow estimation and prediction with memory. Our method enables memory read-out and update modules for aggregating historical motion information in real-time. Furthermore we integrate resolution-adaptive re-scaling to accommodate diverse video resolutions. Besides our approach seamlessly extends to the future prediction of optical flow based on past observations. Leveraging effective historical motion aggregation our method outperforms VideoFlow with fewer parameters and faster inference speed on Sintel and KITTI-15 datasets in terms of generalization performance. At the time of submission MemFlow also leads in performance on the 1080p Spring dataset. Codes and models will be available at: https://dqiaole.github.io/MemFlow/",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Ultra-fine-grained visual categorization (Ultra-FGVC) aims at distinguishing highly similar sub-categories within fine-grained objects such as different soybean cultivars. Compared to traditional fine-grained visual categorization Ultra-FGVC encounters more hurdles due to the small inter-class and large intra-class variation. Given these challenges relying on human annotation for Ultra-FGVC is impractical. To this end our work introduces a novel task termed Ultra-Fine-Grained Novel Class Discovery (UFG-NCD) which leverages partially annotated data to identify new categories of unlabeled images for Ultra-FGVC. To tackle this problem we devise a Region-Aligned Proxy Learning (RAPL) framework which comprises a Channel-wise Region Alignment (CRA) module and a Semi-Supervised Proxy Learning (SemiPL) strategy. The CRA module is designed to extract and utilize discriminative features from local regions facilitating knowledge transfer from labeled to unlabeled classes. Furthermore SemiPL strengthens representation learning and knowledge transfer with proxy-guided supervised learning and proxy-guided contrastive learning. Such techniques leverage class distribution information in the embedding space improving the mining of subtle differences between labeled and unlabeled ultra-fine-grained classes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RAPL significantly outperforms baselines across various datasets indicating its effectiveness in handling the challenges of UFG-NCD.

A common approach enabling the ability to reason over visual data is Scene Graph Generation (SGG); however many existing approaches assume undisturbed vision i.e. the absence of real-world corruptions such as fog snow smoke as well as non-uniform perturbations like sun glare or water drops. In this work we propose a novel SGG benchmark containing procedurally generated weather corruptions and other transformations over the Visual Genome dataset.

However due to the lack of training data and the challenges in handling the high variety of geometry and appearance the existing methods for these tasks suffer from issues like inflexibility instability and low fidelity. In this paper we propose a novel framework DiffusionGAN3D which boosts text-guided 3D domain adaptation and generation by combining 3D GANs and diffusion priors. Specifically we integrate the pre-trained 3D generative models (e.g. EG3D) and text-to-image diffusion models. The former provides a strong foundation for stable and high-quality avatar generation from text. And the diffusion models in turn offer powerful priors and guide the 3D generator finetuning with informative direction to achieve flexible and efficient text-guided domain adaptation. To enhance the diversity in domain adaptation and the generation capability in text-to-avatar we introduce the relative distance loss and case-specific learnable triplane respectively. Besides we design a progressive texture refinement module to improve the texture quality for both tasks above. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves excellent results in both domain adaptation and text-to-avatar tasks outperforming existing methods in terms of generation quality and efficiency.

With the goal of minimizing human supervision in the editing process this paper presents a novel method for interactive batch image editing using StyleGAN as the medium. Given an edit specified by users in an example image (e.g. make the face frontal) our method can automatically transfer that edit to other test images so that regardless of their initial state (pose) they all arrive at the same final state (e.g. all facing front).

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Oriented object detection has been developed rapidly in the past few years where rotation equivariance is crucial for detectors to predict rotated boxes. It is expected that the prediction can maintain the corresponding rotation when objects rotate but severe mutation in angular prediction is sometimes observed when objects rotate near the boundary angle which is well-known boundary discontinuity problem. The problem has been long believed to be caused by the sharp loss increase at the angular boundary and widely used joint-optim IoU-like methods deal with this problem by loss-smoothing. However we experimentally find that even state-of-the-art IoU-like methods actually fail to solve the problem. On further analysis we find that the key to solution lies in encoding mode of the smoothing function rather than in joint or independent optimization. In existing IoU-like methods the model essentially attempts to fit the angular relationship between box and object where the break point at angular boundary makes the predictions highly unstable. To deal with this issue we propose a dual-optimization paradigm for angles. We decouple reversibility and joint-optim from single smoothing function into two distinct entities which for the first time achieves the objectives of both correcting angular boundary and blending angle with other parameters. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets show that boundary discontinuity problem is well-addressed. Moreover typical IoU-like methods are improved to the same level without obvious performance gap. The code is available at https://github.com/hangxu-cv/cvpr24acm",

We explore deformation-aware face stylization that diverges from traditional single-image style reference opting for a real-style image pair instead. The cornerstone of our method is the utilization of a self-supervised vision transformer specifically DINO-ViT to establish a robust and consistent facial structure representation across both real and style domains. Our stylization process begins by adapting the StyleGAN generator to be deformation-aware through the integration of spatial transformers (STN). We then introduce two innovative constraints for generator fine-tuning under the guidance of DINO semantics: i) a directional deformation loss that regulates directional vectors in DINO space and ii) a relative structural consistency constraint based on DINO token self-similarities ensuring diverse generation. Additionally style-mixing is employed to align the color generation with the reference minimizing inconsistent correspondences. This framework delivers enhanced deformability for general one-shot face stylization achieving notable efficiency with a fine-tuning duration of approximately 10 minutes.

While existing methods simply align the person appearance to the target pose they are prone to overfitting due to the lack of a high-level semantic understanding on the source person image. In this paper we propose a novel Coarse-to-Fine Latent Diffusion (CFLD) method for PGPIS. In the absence of image-caption pairs and textual prompts we develop a novel training paradigm purely based on images to control the generation process of a pre-trained text-to-image diffusion model. A perception-refined decoder is designed to progressively refine a set of learnable queries and extract semantic understanding of person images as a coarse-grained prompt. This allows for the decoupling of fine-grained appearance and pose information controls at different stages and thus circumventing the potential overfitting problem. To generate more realistic texture details a hybrid-granularity attention module is proposed to encode multi-scale fine-grained appearance features as bias terms to augment the coarse-grained prompt.

Such examples can force DMs to generate images with visible watermarks and prevent DMs from imitating unauthorized images. We construct a generator based on conditional adversarial networks and design three losses (adversarial loss GAN loss and perturbation loss) to generate adversarial examples that have subtle perturbation but can effectively attack DMs to prevent copyright violations. Training a generator for a personal watermark by our method only requires 5-10 samples within 2-3 minutes and once the generator is trained it can generate adversarial examples with that watermark significantly fast (0.2s per image). We conduct extensive experiments in various conditional image-generation scenarios. Compared to existing methods that generate images with chaotic textures our method adds visible watermarks on the generated images which is a more straightforward way to indicate copyright violations. We also observe that our adversarial examples exhibit good transferability across unknown generative models.

By seamlessly integrating these class-aware prompts into the Text Encoder a dynamic class-aware classifier is generated to enhance discriminability for unseen domains.

    "abstract": "We have recently seen tremendous progress in realistic text-to-motion generation. Yet the existing methods often fail or produce implausible motions with unseen text inputs which limits the applications. In this paper we present OMG a novel framework which enables compelling motion generation from zero-shot open-vocabulary text prompts. Our key idea is to carefully tailor the pretrain-then-finetune paradigm into the text-to-motion generation. At the pre-training stage our model improves the generation ability by learning the rich out-of-domain inherent motion traits. To this end we scale up a large unconditional diffusion model up to 1B parameters so as to utilize the massive unlabeled motion data up to over 20M motion instances. At the subsequent fine-tuning stage we introduce motion ControlNet which incorporates text prompts as conditioning information through a trainable copy of the pre-trained model and the proposed novel Mixture-of-Controllers (MoC) block. MoC block adaptively recognizes various ranges of the sub-motions with a cross-attention mechanism and processes them separately with the text-token-specific experts. Such a design effectively aligns the CLIP token embeddings of text prompts to various ranges of compact and expressive motion features. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our OMG achieves significant improvements over the state-of-the-art methods on zero-shot text-to-motion generation.

These techniques allow us to synthesize vivid dynamic scenes outperform previous work qualitatively and quantitatively and achieve state-of-the-art text-to-4D performance.

    "abstract": "Face Anti-Spoofing (FAS) is pivotal in safeguarding facial recognition systems against presentation attacks. While domain generalization (DG) methods have been developed to enhance FAS performance they predominantly focus on learning domain-invariant features during training which may not guarantee generalizability to unseen data that differs largely from the source distributions. Our insight is that testing data can serve as a valuable resource to enhance the generalizability beyond mere evaluation for DG FAS. In this paper we introduce a novel Test-Time Domain Generalization (TTDG) framework for FAS which leverages the testing data to boost the model's generalizability. Our method consisting of Test-Time Style Projection (TTSP) and Diverse Style Shifts Simulation (DSSS) effectively projects the unseen data to the seen domain space. In particular we first introduce the innovative TTSP to project the styles of the arbitrarily unseen samples of the testing distribution to the known source space of the training distributions. We then design the efficient DSSS to synthesize diverse style shifts via learnable style bases with two specifically designed losses in a hyperspherical feature space. Our method eliminates the need for model updates at the test time and can be seamlessly integrated into not only the CNN but also ViT backbones. Comprehensive experiments on widely used cross-domain FAS benchmarks demonstrate our method's state-of-the-art performance and effectiveness",

    "abstract": "Recently there has been an increased interest in the practical problem of learning multiple dense scene understanding tasks from partially annotated data where each training sample is only labeled for a subset of the tasks. The missing of task labels in training leads to low-quality and noisy predictions as can be observed from state-of-the-art methods. To tackle this issue we reformulate the partially-labeled multi-task dense prediction as a pixel-level denoising problem and propose a novel multi-task denoising diffusion framework coined as DiffusionMTL. It designs a joint diffusion and denoising paradigm to model a potential noisy distribution in the task prediction or feature maps and generate rectified outputs for different tasks. To exploit multi-task consistency in denoising we further introduce a Multi-Task Conditioning strategy which can implicitly utilize the complementary nature of the tasks to help learn the unlabeled tasks leading to an improvement in the denoising performance of the different tasks. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate that the proposed multi-task denoising diffusion model can significantly improve multi-task prediction maps and outperform the state-of-the-art methods on three challenging multi-task benchmarks under two different partial-labeling evaluation settings.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "The traditional frame-based cameras that rely on exposure windows for imaging experience motion blur in high-speed scenarios. Frame-based deblurring methods lack reliable motion cues to restore sharp images under extreme blur conditions. The spike camera is a novel neuromorphic visual sensor that outputs spike streams with ultra-high temporal resolution. It can supplement the temporal information lost in traditional cameras and guide motion deblurring. However in real-world scenarios aligning discrete RGB images and continuous spike streams along both temporal and spatial axes is challenging due to the complexity of calibrating their coordinates device displacements in vibrations and time deviations. Misalignment of pixels leads to severe degradation of deblurring. We introduce the first framework for spike-guided motion deblurring without knowing the spatiotemporal alignment between spikes and images. To address the problem we first propose a novel three-stage network containing a basic deblurring net a carefully designed bi-directional deformable aligning module and a flow-based multi-scale fusion net. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach can effectively guide the image deblurring with unknown alignment surpassing the performance of other methods.

    "abstract": "Geometry Problem Solving has drawn growing attention recently due to its application prospects in intelligent education field. However existing methods are still inadequate to meet the needs of practical application suffering from the following limitations: 1) explainability is not ensured which is essential in real teaching scenarios; 2) the small scale and incomplete annotation of existing datasets make it hard for model to comprehend geometric knowledge. To tackle the above problems we propose a novel method called Explainable Geometry Problem Solving (E-GPS). E-GPS first parses the geometric diagram and problem text into unified formal language representations. Then the answer and explainable reasoning and solving steps are obtained by a Top-Down Problem Solver (TD-PS) which innovatively solves the problem from the target and focuses on what is needed. To alleviate the data issues a Bottom-Up Problem Generator (BU-PG) is devised to augment the data set with various well-annotated constructed geometry problems. It enables us to train an enhanced theorem predictor with a better grasp of theorem knowledge which further improves the efficiency of TD-PS. Extensive experiments demonstrate that E-GPS maintains comparable solving performances with fewer steps and provides outstanding explainability",

In this work we propose to explore foundation models for the task of keypoint detection on 3D shapes. A unique characteristic of keypoint detection is that it requires semantic and geometric awareness while demanding high localization accuracy. To address this problem we propose first to back-project features from large pre-trained 2D vision models onto 3D shapes and employ them for this task. We show that we obtain robust 3D features that contain rich semantic information and analyze multiple candidate features stemming from different 2D foundation models. Second we employ a keypoint candidate optimization module which aims to match the average observed distribution of keypoints on the shape and is guided by the back-projected features. The resulting approach achieves a new state of the art for few-shot keypoint detection on the KeyPointNet dataset almost doubling the performance of the previous best methods",

While some studies explore the rich generative prior of pre-trained diffusion models they typically rely on the assumed degradation process and cannot handle unknown real-world degradations well. To address these problems we propose a novel zero-shot framework FourierDiff which embeds Fourier priors into a pre-trained diffusion model to harmoniously handle the joint degradation of luminance and structures. FourierDiff is appealing in its relaxed requirements on paired training data and degradation assumptions. The key zero-shot insight is motivated by image characteristics in the Fourier domain: most luminance information concentrates on amplitudes while structure and content information are closely related to phases. Based on this observation we decompose the sampled results of the reverse diffusion process in the Fourier domain and take advantage of the amplitude of the generative prior to align the enhanced brightness with the distribution of natural images. To yield a sharp and content-consistent enhanced result we further design a spatial-frequency alternating optimization strategy to progressively refine the phase of the input.

    "abstract": "Stereo matching is a core task for many computer vision and robotics applications. Despite their dominance in traditional stereo methods the hand-crafted Markov Random Field (MRF) models lack sufficient modeling accuracy compared to end-to-end deep models. While deep learning representations have greatly improved the unary terms of the MRF models the overall accuracy is still severely limited by the hand-crafted pairwise terms and message passing. To address these issues we propose a neural MRF model where both potential functions and message passing are designed using data-driven neural networks. Our fully data-driven model is built on the foundation of variational inference theory to prevent convergence issues and retain stereo MRF's graph inductive bias. To make the inference tractable and scale well to high-resolution images we also propose a Disparity Proposal Network (DPN) to adaptively prune the search space of disparity. The proposed approach ranks 1^ st on both KITTI 2012 and 2015 leaderboards among all published methods while running faster than 100 ms. This approach significantly outperforms prior global methods e.g. lowering D1 metric by more than 50% on KITTI 2015.

In this work for the first time we synergize information from image text and event-data domains and introduce OpenESS to enable scalable ESS in an open-world annotation-efficient manner. We achieve this goal by transferring the semantically rich CLIP knowledge from image-text pairs to event streams.

    "abstract": "Aligned text-image encoders such as CLIP have become the de-facto model for vision-language tasks. Furthermore modality-specific encoders achieve impressive performances in their respective domains. This raises a central question: does an alignment exist between uni-modal vision and language encoders since they fundamentally represent the same physical world? Analyzing the latent spaces structure of vision and language models on image-caption benchmarks using the Centered Kernel Alignment (CKA) we find that the representation spaces of unaligned and aligned encoders are semantically similar. In the absence of statistical similarity in aligned encoders like CLIP we show that a possible matching of unaligned encoders exists without any training. We frame this as a seeded graph-matching problem exploiting the semantic similarity between graphs and propose two methods - a Fast Quadratic Assignment Problem optimization and a novel localized CKA metric-based matching/retrieval. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this on several downstream tasks including cross-lingual cross-domain caption matching and image classification.

    "abstract": "Currently high-definition (HD) map construction leans towards a lightweight online generation tendency which aims to preserve timely and reliable road scene information. However map elements contain strong shape priors. Subtle and sparse annotations make current detection-based frameworks ambiguous in locating relevant feature scopes and cause the loss of detailed structures in prediction. To alleviate these problems we propose MGMap a mask-guided approach that effectively highlights the informative regions and achieves precise map element localization by introducing the learned masks. Specifically MGMap employs learned masks based on the enhanced multi-scale BEV features from two perspectives. At the instance level we propose the Mask-activated instance (MAI) decoder which incorporates global instance and structural information into instance queries by the activation of instance masks. At the point level a novel position-guided mask patch refinement (PG-MPR) module is designed to refine point locations from a finer-grained perspective enabling the extraction of point-specific patch information. Compared to the baselines our proposed MGMap achieves a notable improvement of around 10 mAP for different input modalities.

To address this we collect the first dataset consisting of human natural language feedback on low-level vision.

The constructed Q-Pathway dataset includes 58K detailed human feedbacks on 18973 multi-sourced images with diverse low-level appearance.

    "abstract": "Camera-parameter-free multi-view pose estimation is an emerging technique for 3D human pose estimation (HPE). They can infer the camera settings implicitly or explicitly to mitigate the depth uncertainty impact showcasing significant potential in real applications. However due to the limited camera setting diversity in the available datasets the inferred camera parameters are always simply hardcoded into the model during training and not adaptable to the input in inference making the learned models cannot generalize well under unseen camera settings. A natural solution is to artificially synthesize some samples i.e. 2D-3D pose pairs under massive new camera settings. Unfortunately to prevent over-fitting the existing camera setting the number of synthesized samples for each new camera setting should be comparable with that for the existing one which multiplies the scale of training and even makes it computationally prohibitive. In this paper we propose a novel HPE approach under the invariant risk minimization (IRM) paradigm. Precisely we first synthesize 2D poses from myriad camera settings. We then train our model under the IRM paradigm which targets at learning a common optimal model across all camera settings and thus enforces the model to automatically learn the camera parameters based on the input data. This allows the model to accurately infer 3D poses on unseen data by training on only a handful of samples from each synthesized setting and thus avoid the unbearable training cost increment. Another appealing feature of our method is that benefited from the capability of IRM in identifying the invariant features its performance on the seen camera settings is enhanced as well.

To overcome this challenge we propose a novel zero-shot tone mapping framework that utilizes shared structure knowledge allowing us to transfer a pre-trained mapping model from the LDR domain to HDR fields without paired training data. Our approach involves decomposing both the LDR and HDR images into two components: structural information and tonal information.

Additionally for improved image details we introduce a dual-control network architecture that enables different types of conditional inputs to control different scales of the output.

First they do not capture both short-range and long-range temporal dependencies and typically employ complex hierarchical deep network architectures that are hard to integrate with existing pretrained image-text foundation models. To effectively address this limitation we instead keep the network architecture simple and use a set of data tokens that operate at different temporal resolutions in a hierarchical manner accounting for the temporally hierarchical nature of videos. By employing a simple two-tower architecture we are able to initialize our video-language model with pretrained image-text foundation models thereby boosting the final performance. Second existing video-language alignment works struggle due to the lack of semantically aligned large-scale training data. To overcome it we leverage recent LLMs to curate the largest video-language dataset to date with better visual grounding. Furthermore unlike existing video-text datasets which only contain short clips our dataset is enriched with video clips of varying durations to aid our temporally hierarchical data tokens in extracting better representations at varying temporal scales.

However the lack of high-level semantics in pre-training still heavily hinders the performance of downstream tasks. We observe that 3D medical images contain relatively consistent contextual position information i.e. consistent geometric relations between different organs which leads to a potential way for us to learn consistent semantic representations in pre-training. In this paper we propose a simple-yet-effective Volume Contrast (VoCo) framework to leverage the contextual position priors for pre-training. Specifically we first generate a group of base crops from different regions while enforcing feature discrepancy among them where we employ them as class assignments of different regions. Then we randomly crop sub-volumes and predict them belonging to which class (located at which region) by contrasting their similarity to different base crops which can be seen as predicting contextual positions of different sub-volumes. Through this pretext task VoCo implicitly encodes the contextual position priors into model representations without the guidance of annotations enabling us to effectively improve the performance of downstream tasks that require high-level semantics. Extensive experimental results on six downstream tasks demonstrate the superior effectiveness of VoCo. Code will be available at https://github.com/Luffy03/VoCo",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Generalizable 3D object reconstruction from single-view RGB-D images remains a challenging task particularly with real-world data. Current state-of-the-art methods develop Transformer-based implicit field learning necessitating an intensive learning paradigm that requires dense query-supervision uniformly sampled throughout the entire space. We propose a novel approach IPoD which harmonizes implicit field learning with point diffusion. This approach treats the query points for implicit field learning as a noisy point cloud for iterative denoising allowing for their dynamic adaptation to the target object shape. Such adaptive query points harness diffusion learning's capability for coarse shape recovery and also enhances the implicit representation's ability to delineate finer details. Besides an additional self-conditioning mechanism is designed to use implicit predictions as the guidance of diffusion learning leading to a cooperative system. Experiments conducted on the CO3D-v2 dataset affirm the superiority of IPoD achieving 7.8% improvement in F-score and 28.6% in Chamfer distance over existing methods. The generalizability of IPoD is also demonstrated on the MVImgNet dataset. Our project page is at https://yushuang-wu.github.io/IPoD",

    "abstract": "As for human avatar reconstruction contemporary techniques commonly necessitate the acquisition of costly data and struggle to achieve satisfactory results from a small number of casual images. In this paper we investigate this task from a few-shot unconstrained photo album. The reconstruction of human avatars from such data sources is challenging because of limited data amount and dynamic articulated poses. For handling dynamic data we integrate a skinning mechanism with deep marching tetrahedra (DMTet) to form a drivable tetrahedral representation which drives arbitrary mesh topologies generated by the DMTet for the adaptation of unconstrained images. To effectively mine instructive information from few-shot data we devise a two-phase optimization method with few-shot reference and few-shot guidance. The former focuses on aligning avatar identity with reference images while the latter aims to generate plausible appearances for unseen regions. Overall our framework called HaveFun can undertake avatar reconstruction rendering and animation. Extensive experiments on our developed benchmarks demonstrate that HaveFun exhibits substantially superior performance in reconstructing the human body and hand",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Diffusion models have achieved remarkable image generation quality surpassing previous generative models. However a notable limitation of diffusion models in comparison to GANs is their difficulty in smoothly interpolating between two image samples due to their highly unstructured latent space. Such a smooth interpolation is intriguing as it naturally serves as a solution for the image morphing task with many applications. In this work we address this limitation via DiffMorpher an approach that enables smooth and natural image interpolation by harnessing the prior knowledge of a pre-trained diffusion model. Our key idea is to capture the semantics of the two images by fitting two LoRAs to them respectively and interpolate between both the LoRA parameters and the latent noises to ensure a smooth semantic transition where correspondence automatically emerges without the need for annotation. In addition we propose an attention interpolation and injection technique an adaptive normalization adjustment method and a new sampling schedule to further enhance the smoothness between consecutive images. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DiffMorpher achieves starkly better image morphing effects than previous methods across a variety of object categories bridging a critical functional gap that distinguished diffusion models from GANs",

Existing methods are mostly trained on synthetic datasets which perform poorly in real scenes. In this work to facilitate the development of real-world HDR video reconstruction we present Real-HDRV a large-scale real-world benchmark dataset for HDR video reconstruction featuring various scenes diverse motion patterns and high-quality labels. Specifically our dataset contains 500 LDRs-HDRs video pairs comprising about 28000 LDR frames and 4000 HDR labels covering daytime nighttime indoor and outdoor scenes. To our best knowledge our dataset is the largest real-world HDR video reconstruction dataset. Correspondingly we propose an end-to-end network for HDR video reconstruction where a novel two-stage strategy is designed to perform alignment sequentially. Specifically the first stage performs global alignment with the adaptively estimated global offsets reducing the difficulty of subsequent alignment. The second stage implicitly performs local alignment in a coarse-to-fine manner at the feature level using the adaptive separable convolution. Extensive experiments demonstrate that: (1) models trained on our dataset can achieve better performance on real scenes than those trained on synthetic datasets; (2) our method outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods.

However the computational cost of these methods remains a significant barrier to their widespread adoption particularly in real-time applications such as virtual reality and teleconferencing. While attempts have been made to develop fast neural rendering approaches for static scenes these methods cannot be simply employed to support realistic facial expressions such as in the case of a dynamic facial performance. To address these challenges we propose a novel fast 3D neural implicit head avatar model that achieves real-time rendering while maintaining fine-grained controllability and high rendering quality. Our key idea lies in the introduction of local hash table blendshapes which are learned and attached to the vertices of an underlying face parametric model. These per-vertex hash-tables are linearly merged with weights predicted via a CNN resulting in expression dependent embeddings. Our novel representation enables efficient density and color predictions using a lightweight MLP which is further accelerated by a hierarchical nearest neighbor search method.

    "abstract": "Low-precision quantization is recognized for its efficacy in neural network optimization. Our analysis reveals that non-quantized elementwise operations which are prevalent in layers such as parameterized activation functions batch normalization and quantization scaling dominate the inference cost of low-precision models. These non-quantized elementwise operations are commonly overlooked in SOTA efficiency metrics such as Arithmetic Computation Effort (ACE). In this paper we propose ACEv2 - an extended version of ACE which offers a better alignment with the inference cost of quantized models and their energy consumption on ML hardware. Moreover we introduce PikeLPN a model that addresses these efficiency issues by applying quantization to both elementwise operations and multiply-accumulate operations. In particular we present a novel quantization technique for batch normalization layers named QuantNorm which allows for quantizing the batch normalization parameters without compromising the model performance. Additionally we propose applying Double Quantization where the quantization scaling parameters are quantized. Furthermore we recognize and resolve the issue of distribution mismatch in Separable Convolution layers by introducing Distribution-Heterogeneous Quantization which enables quantizing them to low-precision. PikeLPN achieves Pareto-optimality in efficiency-accuracy trade-off with up to 3X efficiency improvement compared to SOTA low-precision models",

By reasoning along curves CurveCloudNet captures lightweight curve-aware priors to efficiently and accurately reason in several diverse 3D environments. We evaluate CurveCloudNet on multiple synthetic and real datasets that exhibit distinct 3D size and structure. We demonstrate that CurveCloudNet outperforms both point-based and sparse-voxel backbones in various segmentation settings notably scaling to large scenes better than point-based alternatives while exhibiting improved single-object performance over sparse-voxel alternatives.

    "abstract": "To reduce the reliance on large-scale datasets recent works in 3D segmentation resort to few-shot learning. Current 3D few-shot segmentation methods first pre-train models on 'seen' classes and then evaluate their generalization performance on 'unseen' classes. However the prior pre-training stage not only introduces excessive time overhead but also incurs a significant domain gap on 'unseen' classes. To tackle these issues we propose a Non-parametric Network for few-shot 3D Segmentation Seg-NN and its Parametric variant Seg-PN. Without training Seg-NN extracts dense representations by hand-crafted filters and achieves comparable performance to existing parameterized models. Due to the elimination of pre-training Seg-NN can alleviate the domain gap issue and save a substantial amount of time. Based on Seg-NN Seg-PN only requires training a lightweight QUEry-Support Transferring (QUEST) module which enhances the interaction between the support set and query set. Experiments suggest that Seg-PN outperforms previous state-of-the-art method by +4.19% and +7.71% mIoU on S3DIS and ScanNet datasets respectively while reducing training time by -90% indicating its effectiveness and efficiency.

Current state-of-the-art (SOTA) methodologies relying on ultrasound sonography (US) images exhibit limited generalization emphasizing the need for transformative approaches. We observe that individual US frames may lack sufficient information to capture disease manifestation. This study advocates for a paradigm shift towards video-based GBC detection leveraging the inherent advantages of spatiotemporal representations. Employing the Masked Autoencoder (MAE) for representation learning we address shortcomings in conventional image-based methods. We propose a novel design called FocusMAE to systematically bias the selection of masking tokens from high-information regions fostering a more refined representation of malignancy. Additionally we contribute the most extensive US video dataset for GBC detection. We also note that this is the first study on US video-based GBC detection. We validate the proposed methods on the curated dataset and report a new SOTA accuracy of 96.4% for the GBC detection problem against an accuracy of 84% by current Image-based SOTA - GBCNet and RadFormer and 94.7% by Video-based SOTA - AdaMAE. We further demonstrate the generality of the proposed FocusMAE on a public CT-based Covid detection dataset reporting an improvement in accuracy by 3.3% over current baselines.

We present a new methodology to understanding such vision models the Visual Concept Connectome (VCC) which discovers human interpretable concepts and their interlayer connections in a fully unsupervised manner. Our approach simultaneously reveals fine-grained concepts at a layer connection weightings across all layers and is amendable to global analysis of network structure (e.g. branching pattern of hierarchical concept assemblies). Previous work yielded ways to extract interpretable concepts from single layers and examine their impact on classification but did not afford multilayer concept analysis across an entire network architecture. Quantitative and qualitative empirical results show the effectiveness of VCCs in the domain of image classification. Also we leverage VCCs for the application of failure mode debugging to reveal where mistakes arise in deep networks",

    "abstract": "Advances in NERFs have allowed for 3D scene reconstructions and novel view synthesis. Yet efficiently editing these representations while retaining photorealism is an emerging challenge. Recent methods face three primary limitations: they're slow for interactive use lack precision at object boundaries and struggle to ensure multi-view consistency. We introduce IReNe to address these limitations enabling swift near real-time color editing in NeRF. Leveraging a pre-trained NeRF model and a single training image with user-applied color edits IReNe swiftly adjusts network parameters in seconds. This adjustment allows the model to generate new scene views accurately representing the color changes from the training image while also controlling object boundaries and view-specific effects. Object boundary control is achieved by integrating a trainable segmentation module into the model. The process gains efficiency by retraining only the weights of the last network layer. We observed that neurons in this layer can be classified into those responsible for view-dependent appearance and those contributing to diffuse appearance. We introduce an automated classification approach to identify these neuron types and exclusively fine-tune the weights of the diffuse neurons. This further accelerates training and ensures consistent color edits across different views. A thorough validation on a new dataset with edited object colors shows significant quantitative and qualitative advancements over competitors accelerating speeds by 5x and 500x",

    "abstract": "Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation (WSSS) relies on Class Activation Maps (CAMs) to extract spatial information from image-level labels. With the success of Vision Transformer (ViT) the migration of ViT is actively conducted in WSSS. This work proposes a novel WSSS framework with Class Token Infusion (CTI). By infusing the class tokens from images we guide class tokens to possess class-specific distinct characteristics and global-local consistency. For this we devise two kinds of token infusion: 1) Intra-image Class Token Infusion (I-CTI) and 2) Cross-Image Class Token Infusion (C-CTI). In I-CTI we infuse the class tokens from the same but differently augmented images and thus make CAMs consistent among various deformations (view color). In C-CTI by infusing the class tokens from the other images and imposing the resulting CAMs to be similar it learns class-specific distinct characteristics. Besides the CTI we bring the background (BG) concept into ViT with the BG token to reduce the false positive activation of CAMs. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on PASCAL VOC 2012 and MS COCO 2014 datasets achieving state-of-the-art results in weakly supervised semantic segmentation.

    "abstract": "Federated Learning (FL) enables joint training across distributed clients using their local data privately. Federated Multi-Task Learning (FMTL) builds on FL to handle multiple tasks assuming model congruity that identical model architecture is deployed in each client. To relax this assumption and thus extend real-world applicability we introduce a novel problem setting Hetero-Client Federated Multi-Task Learning (HC-FMTL) to accommodate diverse task setups. The main challenge of HC-FMTL is the model incongruity issue that invalidates conventional aggregation methods. It also escalates the difficulties in model aggregation to deal with data and task heterogeneity inherent in FMTL. To address these challenges we propose the FedHCA^2 framework which allows for federated training of personalized models by modeling relationships among heterogeneous clients. Drawing on our theoretical insights into the difference between multi-task and federated optimization we propose the Hyper Conflict-Averse Aggregation scheme to mitigate conflicts during encoder updates. Additionally inspired by task interaction in MTL the Hyper Cross Attention Aggregation scheme uses layer-wise cross attention to enhance decoder interactions while alleviating model incongruity. Moreover we employ learnable Hyper Aggregation Weights for each client to customize personalized parameter updates. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of FedHCA^2 in various HC-FMTL scenarios compared to representative methods.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "This study addresses the challenge of performing visual localization in demanding conditions such as night-time scenarios adverse weather and seasonal changes. While many prior studies have focused on improving image matching performance to facilitate reliable dense keypoint matching between images existing methods often heavily rely on predefined feature points on a reconstructed 3D model. Consequently they tend to overlook unobserved keypoints during the matching process. Therefore dense keypoint matches are not fully exploited leading to a notable reduction in accuracy particularly in noisy scenes. To tackle this issue we propose a novel localization method that extracts reliable semi-dense 2D-3D matching points based on dense keypoint matches. This approach involves regressing semi-dense 2D keypoints into 3D scene coordinates using a point inference network. The network utilizes both geometric and visual cues to effectively infer 3D coordinates for unobserved keypoints from the observed ones. The abundance of matching information significantly enhances the accuracy of camera pose estimation even in scenarios involving noisy or sparse 3D models. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms other methods in challenging scenes and achieves competitive results in large-scale visual localization benchmarks.

This pipeline is used to construct an amodal completion evaluation benchmark MP3D-Amodal consisting of a variety of object categories and labels. To better handle the amodal completion task in the wild we explore two architecture variants: a two-stage model that first infers the occluder followed by amodal mask completion; and a one-stage model that exploits the representation power of Stable Diffusion for amodal segmentation across many categories.

Towards more realistic and functional 3D motion models we highlight limitations in existing generative modeling techniques particularly in overly simplistic latent code sampling strategies. We then introduce a transformer-based diversification mechanism that learns to effectively guide sampling in the latent space.

Inspired by this insight we propose a novel voxel pooling strategy to reduce such error dubbed BEVSpread. Specifically instead of bringing the image features contained in a frustum point to a single BEV grid BEVSpread considers each frustum point as a source and spreads the image features to the surrounding BEV grids with adaptive weights. To achieve superior propagation performance a specific weight function is designed to dynamically control the decay speed of the weights according to distance and depth. Aided by customized CUDA parallel acceleration BEVSpread achieves comparable inference time as the original voxel pooling. Extensive experiments on two large-scale roadside benchmarks demonstrate that as a plug-in BEVSpread can significantly improve the performance of existing frustum-based BEV methods by a large margin of (1.12 5.26 3.01) AP in vehicle pedestrian and cyclist",

On the other hand the research on various new practical anomaly detection settings is limited by the scale of the dataset posing a risk of overfitting in evaluation results. Therefore we propose a large-scale Real-world and multi-view Industrial Anomaly Detection dataset named Real-IAD which contains 150K high-resolution images of 30 different objects an order of magnitude larger than existing datasets. It has a larger range of defect area and ratio proportions making it more challenging than previous datasets. To make the dataset closer to real application scenarios we adopted a multi-view shooting method and proposed sample-level evaluation metrics. In addition beyond the general unsupervised anomaly detection setting we propose a new setting for Fully Unsupervised Industrial Anomaly Detection (FUIAD) based on the observation that the yield rate in industrial production is usually greater than 60% which has more practical application value.

In this work we tackle the task by perceiving the images as an amalgamation of various objects and aim to control the properties of each object in a fine-grained manner. Out of these properties we identify structure and appearance as the most intuitive to understand and useful for editing purposes. We propose PAIR Diffusion a generic framework that enables a diffusion model to control the structure and appearance properties of each object in the image. We show that having control over the properties of each object in an image leads to comprehensive editing capabilities. Our framework allows for various object-level editing operations on real images such as reference image-based appearance editing free-form shape editing adding objects and variations.

    "abstract": "Adversarial examples mislead deep neural networks with imperceptible perturbations and have brought significant threats to deep learning. An important aspect is their transferability which refers to their ability to deceive other models thus enabling attacks in the black-box setting. Though various methods have been proposed to boost transferability the performance still falls short compared with white-box attacks. In this work we observe that existing input transformation based attacks one of the mainstream transfer-based attacks result in different attention heatmaps on various models which might limit the transferability. We also find that breaking the intrinsic relation of the image can disrupt the attention heatmap of the original image. Based on this finding we propose a novel input transformation based attack called block shuffle and rotation (BSR). Specifically BSR splits the input image into several blocks then randomly shuffles and rotates these blocks to construct a set of new images for gradient calculation. Empirical evaluations on the ImageNet dataset demonstrate that BSR could achieve significantly better transferability than the existing input transformation based methods under single-model and ensemble-model settings. Combining BSR with the current input transformation method can further improve the transferability which significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.

    "title": "DriveWorld: 4D Pre-trained Scene Understanding via World Models for Autonomous Driving",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Vision-centric autonomous driving has recently raised wide attention due to its lower cost. Pre-training is essential for extracting a universal representation. However current vision-centric pre-training typically relies on either 2D or 3D pre-text tasks overlooking the temporal characteristics of autonomous driving as a 4D scene understanding task. In this paper we address this challenge by introducing a world model-based autonomous driving 4D representation learning framework dubbed DriveWorld which is capable of pre-training from multi-camera driving videos in a spatio-temporal fashion. Specifically we propose a Memory State-Space Model for spatio-temporal modelling which consists of a Dynamic Memory Bank module for learning temporal-aware latent dynamics to predict future changes and a Static Scene Propagation module for learning spatial-aware latent statics to offer comprehensive scene contexts. We additionally introduce a Task Prompt to decouple task-aware features for various downstream tasks. The experiments demonstrate that DriveWorld delivers promising results on various autonomous driving tasks. When pre-trained with the OpenScene dataset DriveWorld achieves a 7.5% increase in mAP for 3D object detection a 3.0% increase in IoU for online mapping a 5.0% increase in AMOTA for multi-object tracking a 0.1m decrease in minADE for motion forecasting a 3.0% increase in IoU for occupancy prediction and a 0.34m reduction in average L2 error for planning",

    "abstract": "Modularity plays a crucial role in the development and maintenance of complex systems. While end-to-end text spotting efficiently mitigates the issues of error accumulation and sub-optimal performance seen in traditional two-step methodologies the two-step methods continue to be favored in many competitions and practical settings due to their superior modularity. In this paper we introduce Bridging Text Spotting a novel approach that resolves the error accumulation and suboptimal performance issues in two-step methods while retaining modularity. To achieve this we adopt a well-trained detector and recognizer that are developed and trained independently and then lock their parameters to preserve their already acquired capabilities. Subsequently we introduce a Bridge that connects the locked detector and recognizer through a zero-initialized neural network. This zero-initialized neural network initialized with weights set to zeros ensures seamless integration of the large receptive field features in detection into the locked recognizer. Furthermore since the fixed detector and recognizer cannot naturally acquire end-to-end optimization features we adopt the Adapter to facilitate their efficient learning of these features. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method through extensive experiments: Connecting the latest detector and recognizer through Bridging Text Spotting we achieved an accuracy of 83.3% on Total-Text 69.8% on CTW1500 and 89.5% on ICDAR 2015.

To address these limitations we introduce a novel 3D pre-training framework for robotics named SUGAR that captures semantic geometric and affordance properties of objects through 3D point clouds. We underscore the importance of cluttered scenes in 3D representation learning and automatically construct a multi-object dataset benefiting from cost-free supervision in simulation. SUGAR employs a versatile transformer-based model to jointly address five pre-training tasks namely cross-modal knowledge distillation for semantic learning masked point modeling to understand geometry structures grasping pose synthesis for object affordance 3D instance segmentation and referring expression grounding to analyze cluttered scenes.

On the other hand the application often demands rendering from camera views that deviate from the inputs to accurately simulate behaviors like lane changes. In this paper we propose several insights that allow a better utilization of Lidar data to improve NeRF quality on street scenes. First our framework learns a geometric scene representation from Lidar which are fused with the implicit grid-based representation for radiance decoding thereby supplying stronger geometric information offered by explicit point cloud.

    "abstract": "Current vision-language pre-training (VLP) methodologies predominantly depend on paired image-text datasets a resource that is challenging to acquire in radiology due to privacy considerations and labelling complexities. Data augmentation provides a practical solution to overcome the issue of data scarcity however most augmentation methods exhibit a limited focus prioritising either image or text augmentation exclusively. Acknowledging this limitation our objective is to devise a framework capable of concurrently augmenting medical image and text data. We design a Pairwise Augmentation (PairAug) approach that contains an Inter-patient Augmentation (InterAug) branch and an Intra-patient Augmentation (IntraAug) branch. Specifically the InterAug branch of our approach generates radiology images using synthesised yet plausible reports derived from a Large Language Model (LLM). The generated pairs can be considered a collection of new patient cases since they are artificially created and may not exist in the original dataset. In contrast the IntraAug branch uses newly generated reports to manipulate images. This process allows us to create new paired data for each individual with diverse medical conditions. Our extensive experiments on various downstream tasks covering medical image classification zero-shot and fine-tuning analysis demonstrate that our PairAug concurrently expanding both image and text data substantially outperforms image-/text-only expansion baselines and advanced medical VLP baselines.

By initializing the bias of the neural network within different ranges sub-functions with various frequencies in the variable-periodic function are selected for activation. Consequently the supported frequency set of FINER can be flexibly tuned leading to improved performance in signal representation.

Existing works mostly rely on training deep models to learn the distribution of normality with either video-level supervision one-class supervision or in an unsupervised setting. Training-based methods are prone to be domain-specific thus being costly for practical deployment as any domain change will involve data collection and model training. In this paper we radically depart from previous efforts and propose LAnguage-based VAD (LAVAD) a method tackling VAD in a novel training-free paradigm exploiting the capabilities of pre-trained large language models (LLMs) and existing vision-language models (VLMs). We leverage VLM-based captioning models to generate textual descriptions for each frame of any test video. With the textual scene description we then devise a prompting mechanism to unlock the capability of LLMs in terms of temporal aggregation and anomaly score estimation turning LLMs into an effective video anomaly detector. We further leverage modality-aligned VLMs and propose effective techniques based on cross-modal similarity for cleaning noisy captions and refining the LLM-based anomaly scores. We evaluate LAVAD on two large datasets featuring real-world surveillance scenarios (UCF-Crime and XD-Violence) showing that it outperforms both unsupervised and one-class methods without requiring any training or data collection",

To mitigate these limitations numerous studies have endeavored to fine-tune the pre-trained diffusion models i.e.. UNet utilizing various technologies. Yet amidst these efforts a pivotal question of text-to-image diffusion model training has remained largely unexplored: Is it possible and feasible to fine-tune the text encoder to improve the performance of text-to-image diffusion models? Our findings reveal that instead of replacing the CLIP text encoder used in Stable Diffusion with other large language models we can enhance it through our proposed fine-tuning approach TextCraftor leading to substantial improvements in quantitative benchmarks and human assessments.

    "abstract": "Existing action quality assessment (AQA) methods mainly learn deep representations at the video level for scoring diverse actions. Due to the lack of a fine-grained understanding of actions in videos they harshly suffer from low credibility and interpretability thus insufficient for stringent applications such as Olympic diving events. We argue that a fine-grained understanding of actions requires the model to perceive and parse actions in both time and space which is also the key to the credibility and interpretability of the AQA technique. Based on this insight we propose a new fine-grained spatial-temporal action parser named FineParser. It learns human-centric foreground action representations by focusing on target action regions within each frame and exploiting their fine-grained alignments in time and space to minimize the impact of invalid backgrounds during the assessment. In addition we construct fine-grained annotations of human-centric foreground action masks for the FineDiving dataset called FineDiving-HM. With refined annotations on diverse target action procedures FineDiving-HM can promote the development of real-world AQA systems. Through extensive experiments we demonstrate the effectiveness of FineParser which outperforms state-of-the-art methods while supporting more tasks of fine-grained action understanding.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Universal image restoration is a practical and potential computer vision task for real-world applications. The main challenge of this task is handling the different degradation distributions at once. Existing methods mainly utilize task-specific conditions (e.g. prompt) to guide the model to learn different distributions separately named multi-partite mapping. However it is not suitable for universal model learning as it ignores the shared information between different tasks. In this work we propose an advanced selective hourglass mapping strategy based on diffusion model termed DiffUIR. Two novel considerations make our DiffUIR non-trivial. Firstly we equip the model with strong condition guidance to obtain accurate generation direction of diffusion model (selective). More importantly DiffUIR integrates a flexible shared distribution term (SDT) into the diffusion algorithm elegantly and naturally which gradually maps different distributions into a shared one. In the reverse process combined with SDT and strong condition guidance DiffUIR iteratively guides the shared distribution to the task-specific distribution with high image quality (hourglass). Without bells and whistles by only modifying the mapping strategy we achieve state-of-the-art performance on five image restoration tasks 22 benchmarks in the universal setting and zero-shot generalization setting. Surprisingly by only using a lightweight model (only 0.89M) we could achieve outstanding performance.

    "abstract": "Vision-language models (VLMs) pre-trained on web-scale datasets have demonstrated remarkable capabilities on downstream tasks when fine-tuned with minimal data. However many VLMs rely on proprietary data and are not open-source which restricts the use of white-box approaches for fine-tuning. As such we aim to develop a black-box approach to optimize VLMs through natural language prompts thereby avoiding the need to access model parameters feature embeddings or even output logits. We propose employing chat-based LLMs to search for the best text prompt for VLMs. Specifically we adopt an automatic \"hill-climbing\" procedure that converges to an effective prompt by evaluating the performance of current prompts and asking LLMs to refine them based on textual feedback all within a conversational process without human-in-the-loop. In a challenging 1-shot image classification setup our simple approach surpasses the white-box continuous prompting method (CoOp) by an average of 1.5% across 11 datasets including ImageNet. Our approach also outperforms both human-engineered and LLM-generated prompts. We highlight the advantage of conversational feedback that incorporates both positive and negative prompts suggesting that LLMs can utilize the implicit \"gradient\" direction in textual feedback for a more efficient search. In addition we find that the text prompts generated through our strategy are not only more interpretable but also transfer well across different VLM architectures in a black-box manner. Lastly we demonstrate our framework on a state-of-the-art black-box VLM (DALL-E 3) for text-to-image optimization",

In distinction to the traditional paradigm that is limited to predefined categories this setting promises a continual and generalizable way of estimating objectness using class-agnostic information. However achieving such decorrelation between objectness and class information proves challenging. Without explicit consideration existing methods usually exhibit low recall on unknown objects and can misclassify them into known classes. To address this problem we exploit three levels of orthogonality in the detection process: First the objectness and classification heads are disentangled by operating on separate sets of features that are orthogonal to each other in a devised polar coordinate system. Secondly a prediction decorrelation loss is introduced to guide the detector towards more general and class-independent prediction. Furthermore we propose a calibration scheme that helps maintain orthogonality throughout the training process to mitigate catastrophic interference and facilitate incremental learning of previously unseen objects.

Despite their success LVLMs still suffer from the issue of object hallucinations where models generate plausible yet incorrect outputs that include objects that do not exist in the images. To mitigate this issue we introduce Visual Contrastive Decoding (VCD) a simple and training-free method that contrasts output distributions derived from original and distorted visual inputs. The proposed VCD effectively reduces the over-reliance on statistical bias and unimodal priors two essential causes of object hallucinations. This adjustment ensures the generated content is closely grounded to visual inputs resulting in contextually accurate outputs. Our experiments show that VCD without either additional training or the usage of external tools significantly mitigates the object hallucination issue across different LVLM families. Beyond mitigating object hallucinations VCD also excels in general LVLM benchmarks highlighting its wide-ranging applicability",

The first stage is targeted for context-agnostic identity-preserving pretraining of the object encoder enabling the encoder to learn an embedding that is both view-invariant and conducive to enhanced detail preservation. The subsequent stage leverages this representation to learn seamless harmonization of the object composited to the background.

Although great progress has been witnessed we experimentally reveal that current methods reach marginal performance gain within the use of the unlabeled frames leading to the underutilization issue. To fully explore the potential of the unlabeled frames for AVS we explicitly divide them into two categories based on their temporal characteristics i.e. neighboring frame (NF) and distant frame (DF). NFs temporally adjacent to the labeled frame often contain rich motion information that assists in the accurate localization of sounding objects. Contrary to NFs DFs have long temporal distances from the labeled frame which share semantic-similar objects with appearance variations. Considering their unique characteristics we propose a versatile framework that effectively leverages them to tackle AVS. Specifically for NFs we exploit the motion cues as the dynamic guidance to improve the objectness localization. Besides we exploit the semantic cues in DFs by treating them as valid augmentations to the labeled frames which are then used to enrich data diversity in a self-training manner. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the versatility and superiority of our method unleashing the power of the abundant unlabeled frames",

The problem is that these artifacts are especially pronounced in real-world videos but these trackers are unable to train on such scenes due to a dearth of annotations. DriveTrack bridges this gap by building a framework to automatically annotate point tracks on autonomous driving datasets. We release a dataset consisting of 1 billion point tracks across 24 hours of video which is seven orders of magnitude greater than prior real-world benchmarks and on par with the scale of synthetic benchmarks. DriveTrack unlocks new use cases for point tracking in real-world videos. First we show that fine-tuning keypoint trackers on DriveTrack improves accuracy on real-world scenes by up to 7%. Second we analyze the sensitivity of trackers to visual artifacts in real scenes and motivate the idea of running assistive keypoint selectors alongside trackers",

In this work we propose a physical attack method against infrared detectors based on 3D modeling which is applied to a real car. The goal is to design a set of infrared adversarial stickers to make cars invisible to infrared detectors at various viewing angles distances and scenes. We build a 3D infrared car model with real infrared characteristics and propose an infrared adversarial pattern generation method based on 3D mesh shadow. We propose a 3D control points-based mesh smoothing algorithm and use a set of smoothness loss functions to enhance the smoothness of adversarial meshes and facilitate the sticker implementation. Besides We designed the aluminum stickers and conducted physical experiments on two real Mercedes-Benz A200L cars. Our adversarial stickers hid the cars from Faster RCNN an object detector at various viewing angles distances and scenes. The attack success rate (ASR) was 91.49% for real cars. In comparison the ASRs of random stickers and no sticker were only 6.21% and 0.66% respectively. In addition the ASRs of the designed stickers against six unseen object detectors such as YOLOv3 and Deformable DETR were between 73.35%-95.80% showing good transferability of the attack performance across detectors",

In this paper we present a new framework Sculpt3D that equips the current pipeline with explicit injection of 3D priors from retrieved reference objects without re-training the 2D diffusion model. Specifically we demonstrate that high-quality and diverse 3D geometry can be guaranteed by keypoints supervision through a sparse ray sampling approach. Moreover to ensure accurate appearances of different views we further modulate the output of the 2D diffusion model to the correct patterns of the template views without altering the generated object's style. These two decoupled designs effectively harness 3D information from reference objects to generate 3D objects while preserving the generation quality of the 2D diffusion model.

However the current datasets often collected under single laboratory conditions using complex motion capture equipment and unvarying backgrounds are insufficient. The absence of datasets on variable conditions is stalling the progress of this crucial task. To facilitate the development of 3D pose estimation we present FreeMan the first large-scale multi-view dataset collected under the real- world conditions. FreeMan was captured by synchronizing 8 smartphones across diverse scenarios. It comprises 11M frames from 8000 sequences viewed from different perspec- tives. These sequences cover 40 subjects across 10 different scenarios each with varying lighting conditions. We have also established an semi-automated pipeline containing er- ror detection to reduce the workload of manual check and ensure precise annotation. We provide comprehensive eval- uation baselines for a range of tasks underlining the sig- nificant challenges posed by FreeMan. Further evaluations of standard indoor/outdoor human sensing datasets reveal that FreeMan offers robust representation transferability in real and complex scenes.

Existing relevant methods primarily focus on fundamental visual tasks with limited exploration in vision-language fields. To address this we propose a coarse-to-fine iterative perception framework called ScanFormer. It can iteratively exploit the image scale pyramid to extract linguistic-relevant visual patches from top to bottom. In each iteration irrelevant patches are discarded by our designed informativeness prediction. Furthermore we propose a patch selection strategy for discarded patches to accelerate inference.

Most existing methods treat semantic prediction as an additional rendering task i.e. the \"label rendering\" task to build semantic NeRFs. However by rendering semantic/instance labels per pixel without considering the contextual information of the rendered image these methods usually suffer from unclear boundary segmentation and abnormal segmentation of pixels within an object. To solve this problem we propose Generalized Perception NeRF (GP-NeRF) a novel pipeline that makes the widely used segmentation model and NeRF work compatibly under a unified framework for facilitating context-aware 3D scene perception. To accomplish this goal we introduce transformers to aggregate radiance as well as semantic embedding fields jointly for novel views and facilitate the joint volumetric rendering of both fields. In addition we propose two self-distillation mechanisms i.e. the Semantic Distill Loss and the Depth-Guided Semantic Distill Loss to enhance the discrimination and quality of the semantic field and the maintenance of geometric consistency. In evaluation as shown in Fig. 1 we conduct experimental comparisons under two perception tasks (i.e. semantic and instance segmentation) using both synthetic and real-world datasets.

Conventional lidar sensors are capable of providing centimeter-accurate distance information by emitting laser pulses into a scene and measuring the time-of-flight (ToF) of the reflection. However the polarization of the received light that depends on the surface orientation and material properties is usually not considered. As such the polarization modality has the potential to improve scene reconstruction beyond distance measurements. In this work we introduce a novel long-range polarization wavefront lidar sensor (PolLidar) that modulates the polarization of the emitted and received light. Departing from conventional lidar sensors PolLidar allows access to the raw time-resolved polarimetric wavefronts. We leverage polarimetric wavefronts to estimate normals distance and material properties in outdoor scenarios with a novel learned reconstruction method. To train and evaluate the method we introduce a simulated and real-world long-range dataset with paired raw lidar data ground truth distance and normal maps.

Recent research reveals that for vision tasks test-time adaptation employing diffusion models can achieve state-of-the-art accuracy improvements on OOD samples by generating domain-aligned samples without altering the model's weights. Unfortunately those studies have primarily focused on pixel-level corruptions thereby lacking the generalization to adapt to a broader range of OOD types. We introduce Generalized Diffusion Adaptation (GDA) a novel diffusion-based test-time adaptation method robust against diverse OOD types. Specifically GDA iteratively guides the diffusion by applying a marginal entropy loss derived from the model in conjunction with style and content preservation losses during the reverse sampling process. In other words GDA considers the model's output behavior and the samples' semantic information as a whole reducing ambiguity in downstream tasks. based adaptation. Evaluation across various model architectures and OOD benchmarks indicates that GDA consistently surpasses previous diffusion-based adaptation methods.

Recent methods for co-speech gesture generation while managing to generate beat-aligned motions struggle generating gestures that are semantically aligned with the utterance. Compared to beat gestures that align naturally to the audio signal semantically coherent gestures require modeling the complex interactions between the language and human motion and can be controlled by focusing on certain words. Therefore we present ConvoFusion a diffusion-based approach for multi-modal gesture synthesis which can not only generate gestures based on multi-modal speech inputs but can also facilitate controllability in gesture synthesis. Our method proposes two guidance objectives that allow the users to modulate the impact of different conditioning modalities (e.g. audio vs text) as well as to choose certain words to be emphasized during gesturing. Our method is versatile in that it can be trained either for generating monologue gestures or even the conversational gestures. To further advance the research on multi-party interactive gestures the DnD Group Gesture dataset is released which contains 6 hours of gesture data showing 5 people interacting with one another. We compare our method with several recent works and demonstrate effectiveness of our method on a variety of tasks.

The problem makes existing MLLMs untrustworthy and thus impractical in real-world (especially high-stakes) applications. To address the challenge we present RLHF-V which enhances MLLM trustworthiness via behavior alignment from fine-grained correctional human feedback. Specifically RLHF-V collects human preference in the form of segment-level corrections on hallucinations and performs dense direct preference optimization over the human feedback. Comprehensive experiments on five benchmarks in both automatic and human evaluation show that RLHF-V can enable substantially more trustworthy MLLM behaviors with promising data and computation efficiency. Remarkably using 1.4k annotated data samples RLHF-V significantly reduces the hallucination rate of the base MLLM by 34.8% outperforming the concurrent LLaVA-RLHF trained on 10k annotated data. The final model achieves state-of-the-art performance in trustworthiness among open-source MLLMs and shows better robustness than GPT-4V in preventing hallucinations aroused from over-generalization. All the data code and model weights will be released to facilitate future research",

Recent works learn zero-shot shape reconstruction through generative modeling of 3D assets but these models are computationally expensive at train and inference time. In contrast the traditional approach to this problem is regression-based where deterministic models are trained to directly regress the object shape. Such regression methods possess much higher computational efficiency than generative methods. This raises a natural question: is generative modeling necessary for high performance or conversely are regression-based approaches still competitive? To answer this we design a strong regression-based model called ZeroShape based on the converging findings in this field and a novel insight. We also curate a large real-world evaluation benchmark with objects from three different real-world 3D datasets. This evaluation benchmark is more diverse and an order of magnitude larger than what prior works use to quantitatively evaluate their models aiming at reducing the evaluation variance in our field. We show that ZeroShape not only achieves superior performance over state-of-the-art methods but also demonstrates significantly higher computational and data efficiency",

    "abstract": "Continual Test-Time Adaptation (CTTA) is proposed to migrate a source pre-trained model to continually changing target distributions addressing real-world dynamism. Existing CTTA methods mainly rely on entropy minimization or teacher-student pseudo-labeling schemes for knowledge extraction in unlabeled target domains. However dynamic data distributions cause miscalibrated predictions and noisy pseudo-labels in existing self-supervised learning methods hindering the effective mitigation of error accumulation and catastrophic forgetting problems during the continual adaptation process. To tackle these issues we propose a continual self-supervised method Adaptive Distribution Masked Autoencoders (ADMA) which enhances the extraction of target domain knowledge while mitigating the accumulation of distribution shifts. Specifically we propose a Distribution-aware Masking (DaM) mechanism to adaptively sample masked positions followed by establishing consistency constraints between the masked target samples and the original target samples. Additionally for masked tokens we utilize an efficient decoder to reconstruct a hand-crafted feature descriptor (e.g. Histograms of Oriented Gradients) leveraging its invariant properties to boost task-relevant representations.

    "abstract": "Recognizing continuous changes offers valuable insights into past historical events supports current trend analysis and facilitates future planning. This knowledge is crucial for a variety of fields such as meteorology and agriculture environmental science urban planning and construction tourism and cultural preservation. Currently available datasets in the field of scene change understanding primarily concentrate on two main tasks: the detection of changed regions within a scene and the linguistic description of the change content. Existing datasets focus on recognizing discrete changes such as adding or deleting an object from two images and largely rely on artificially generated images. Consequently the existing change understanding methods primarily focus on identifying distinct object differences overlooking the importance of continuous gradual changes occurring over extended time intervals. To address the above issues we propose a novel benchmark dataset STVchrono targeting the localization and description of long-term continuous changes in real-world scenes. The dataset consists of 71900 photographs from Google Street View API taken over an 18-year span across 50 cities all over the world. Our STVchrono dataset is designed to support real-world continuous change recognition and description in both image pairs and extended image sequences while also enabling the segmentation of changed regions. We conduct experiments to evaluate state-of-the-art methods on continuous change description and segmentation as well as multimodal Large Language Models for describing changes. Our findings reveal that even the most advanced methods lag human performance emphasizing the need to adapt them to continuously changing real-world scenarios. We hope that our benchmark dataset will further facilitate the research of temporal change recognition in a dynamic world. The STVchrono dataset is available at STVchrono Dataset",

However existing methods often fail to fully leverage their representation capabilities primarily due to inadequate alignment of intermediate features during target frame decoding.

Specifically we utilize a conditional decoder with a temporal-aware affine transform module which uses the frame index as a prior condition to effectively align intermediate features with target frames. Besides we introduce a sinusoidal NeRV-like block to generate diverse intermediate features and achieve a more balanced parameter distribution thereby enhancing the model's capacity. With a high-frequency information-preserving reconstruction loss our approach successfully boosts multiple baseline INRs in the reconstruction quality and convergence speed for video regression and exhibits superior inpainting and interpolation results. Further we integrate a consistent entropy minimization technique and develop video codecs based on these boosted INRs. Experiments on the UVG dataset confirm that our enhanced codecs significantly outperform baseline INRs and offer competitive rate-distortion performance compared to traditional and learning-based codecs.

However recent works have shifted towards a more realistic scenario where tasks have shared classes creating blurred task boundaries. Under this setting although existing approaches could be directly applied challenges like data imbalance and varying class-wise data volumes complicate the critical coreset selection used for replay. To tackle these challenges we introduce DECO (Dual-Enhanced Coreset Selection with Class-wise Collaboration) an approach that starts by establishing a class-wise balanced memory to address data imbalances followed by a tailored class-wise gradient-based similarity scoring system for refined coreset selection strategies with reasonable score guidance to all classes. DECO is distinguished by two main strategies: (1) Collaborative Diverse Score Guidance that mitigates biased knowledge in less-exposed classes through guidance from well-established classes simultaneously consolidating the knowledge in the established classes to enhance overall stability. (2) Adaptive Similarity Score Constraint that relaxes constraints between class types boosting learning plasticity for less-exposed classes and assisting well-established classes in defining clearer boundaries thereby improving overall plasticity. Overall DECO helps effectively identify critical coreset samples improving learning stability and plasticity across all classes. Extensive experiments are conducted on four benchmark datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of DECO over other competitors under this online blurry class incremental learning setting",

Due to the incompleteness of object point clouds and the presence of numerous scene points the generated hand is prone to penetrating into the invisible parts of the object and the model is easily affected by scene points. Thus we introduce S2HGrasp a framework composed of two key modules: the Global Perception module that globally perceives partial object point clouds and the DiffuGrasp module designed to generate high-quality human grasps based on complex inputs that include scene points. Additionally we introduce S2HGD dataset which comprises approximately 99000 single-object single-view scene point clouds of 1668 unique objects each annotated with one human grasp. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that S2HGrasp can not only generate natural human grasps regardless of scene points but also effectively prevent penetration between the hand and invisible parts of the object.

A promising approach is to utilize mono audio and corresponding vision to synthesize binaural audio thereby avoiding expensive binaural audio recording.

In this paper we advocate generating binaural audio using fine-grained raw waveform and object-level visual information as guidance. Specifically we propose a Cyclic Locating-and-UPmixing (CLUP) framework that jointly learns visual sounding object localization and binaural audio generation. Visual sounding object localization establishes the correspondence between specific visual objects and sound modalities which provides object-aware guidance to improve binaural generation performance. Meanwhile the spatial information contained in the generated binaural audio can further improve the performance of sounding object localization. In this case visual sounding object localization and binaural audio generation can achieve cyclic learning and benefit from each other.

    "abstract": "Video scene detection aims to temporally link shots for obtaining semantically compact scenes. It is essential for this task to capture scene-distinguishable affinity among shots by similarity assessment. However most methods relies on ordinary shot-to-shot similarities which may inveigle similar shots into being linked even though they are from different scenes and meanwhile hinder dissimilar shots from being blended into a complete scene. In this paper we propose NeighborNet to inject shot contexts into shot-to-shot similarities through carefully exploring the relations between semantic/temporal neighbors of shots over a local time period. In this way shot-to-shot similarities are remeasured as semantic/temporal neighbor-aware similarities so that NeighborNet can learn context embedding into shot features using graph convolutional network. As a result not only do the learned shot features suppress the affinity among similar shots from different scenes but they also promote the affinity among dissimilar shots in the same scene. Experimental results on public benchmark datasets show that our proposed NeighborNet yields substantial improvements in video scene detection especially outperforms released state-of-the-arts by at least 6% in Average Precision (AP).

Unreasonable step sizes and undesirable parameter updates in the prediction.In this paper we design a novel and symplectic integral-inspired framework named symplectic integral neural network (SINN) which engages symplectic trajectories to optimize the pose representation and employs a stable symplectic operator to alternately model the dynamic context. Specifically we design a Symplectic Representation Encoder that performs on enhanced human pose representation to obtain trajectories on the symplectic manifold ensuring numerical stability based on Hamiltonian mechanics and symplectic spatial splitting algorithm. We further present the Symplectic Temporal Aggregation module in the light of the symplectic temporal splitting algorithm which splits the long-term prediction into multiple accurate short-term predictions generated by a symplectic operator to secure modeling stability.

They also face challenges transitioning to point supervision where annotations are simple and effective. Inspired by natural mudslides we propose a universal method called Mudslide that uses simple representations to characterize differences between different instances and can easily be extended from fully-supervised to point-supervised. oncretely we introduce a collapse field and leverage it to construct a force map and initial boundary enabling a distinctive representation for each instance. Each pixel is assigned a collapse force with distinct directions between adjacent instances. Starting from the initial boundary Mudslide executes a pixel-by-pixel collapse along various force directions. Pixels that collapse into the same region are considered as one instance concurrently accounting for both inter-instance distinctions and intra-instance coherence.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "We present MicroCinema a straightforward yet effective framework for high-quality and coherent text-to-video generation. Unlike existing approaches that align text prompts with video directly MicroCinema introduces a Divide-and-Conquer strategy which divides the text-to-video into a two-stage process: text-to-image generation and image&text-to-video generation. This strategy offers two significant advantages. a) It allows us to take full advantage of the recent advances in text-to-image models such as Stable Diffusion Midjourney and DALLE to generate photorealistic and highly detailed images. b) Leveraging the generated image the model can allocate less focus to fine-grained appearance details prioritizing the efficient learning of motion dynamics. To implement this strategy effectively we introduce two core designs. First we propose the Appearance Injection Network enhancing the preservation of the appearance of the given image. Second we introduce the Appearance Noise Prior a novel mechanism aimed at maintaining the capabilities of pre-trained 2D diffusion models. These design elements empower MicroCinema to generate high-quality videos with precise motion guided by the provided text prompts. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of the proposed framework. Concretely MicroCinema achieves SOTA zero-shot FVD of 342.86 on UCF-101 and 377.40 on MSR-VTT",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Multi-instance point cloud registration estimates the poses of multiple instances of a model point cloud in a scene point cloud. Extracting accurate point correspondences is to the center of the problem. Existing approaches usually treat the scene point cloud as a whole overlooking the separation of instances. Therefore point features could be easily polluted by other points from the background or different instances leading to inaccurate correspondences oblivious to separate instances especially in cluttered scenes. In this work we propose MIRETR Multi-Instance REgistration TRansformer a coarse-to-fine approach to the extraction of instance-aware correspondences. At the coarse level it jointly learns instance-aware superpoint features and predicts per-instance masks. With instance masks the influence from outside of the instance being concerned is minimized such that highly reliable superpoint correspondences can be extracted. The superpoint correspondences are then extended to instance candidates at the fine level according to the instance masks. At last an efficient candidate selection and refinement algorithm is devised to obtain the final registrations. Extensive experiments on three public benchmarks demonstrate the efficacy of our approach. In particular MIRETR outperforms the state of the arts by 16.6 points on F1 score on the challenging ROBI benchmark. Code and models are available at https://github.com/zhiyuanYU134/MIRETR",

    "title": "Structure Matters: Tackling the Semantic Discrepancy in Diffusion Models for Image Inpainting",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs) for image inpainting aim to add the noise to the texture of the image during the forward process and recover the masked regions with the unmasked ones of the texture via the reverse denoising process. Despite the meaningful semantics generation the existing arts suffer from the semantic discrepancy between the masked and unmasked regions since the semantically dense unmasked texture fails to be completely degraded while the masked regions turn to the pure noise in diffusion process leading to the large discrepancy between them. In this paper we aim to answer how the unmasked semantics guide the texture denoising process; together with how to tackle the semantic discrepancy to facilitate the consistent and meaningful semantics generation. To this end we propose a novel structure-guided diffusion model for image inpainting named StrDiffusion to reformulate the conventional texture denoising process under the structure guidance to derive a simplified denoising objective for image inpainting while revealing: 1) the semantically sparse structure is beneficial to tackle the semantic discrepancy in the early stage while the dense texture generates the reasonable semantics in the late stage; 2) the semantics from the unmasked regions essentially offer the time-dependent structure guidance for the texture denoising process benefiting from the time-dependent sparsity of the structure semantics. For the denoising process a structure-guided neural network is trained to estimate the simplified denoising objective by exploiting the consistency of the denoised structure between masked and unmasked regions. Besides we devise an adaptive resampling strategy as a formal criterion as whether the structure is competent to guide the texture denoising process while regulate their semantic correlations. Extensive experiments validate the merits of StrDiffusion over the state-of-the-arts. Our code is available at https://github.com/htyjers/StrDiffusion",

    "abstract": "Understanding social interactions involving both verbal and non-verbal cues is essential for effectively interpreting social situations. However most prior works on multimodal social cues focus predominantly on single-person behaviors or rely on holistic visual representations that are not aligned to utterances in multi-party environments. Consequently they are limited in modeling the intricate dynamics of multi-party interactions. In this paper we introduce three new challenging tasks to model the fine-grained dynamics between multiple people: speaking target identification pronoun coreference resolution and mentioned player prediction. We contribute extensive data annotations to curate these new challenges in social deduction game settings. Furthermore we propose a novel multimodal baseline that leverages densely aligned language-visual representations by synchronizing visual features with their corresponding utterances. This facilitates concurrently capturing verbal and non-verbal cues pertinent to social reasoning. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach with densely aligned multimodal representations in modeling fine-grained social interactions.

    "abstract": "In recent decades the vision community has witnessed remarkable progress in visual recognition partially owing to advancements in dataset benchmarks. Notably the established COCO benchmark has propelled the development of modern detection and segmentation systems. However the COCO segmentation benchmark has seen comparatively slow improvement over the last decade. Originally equipped with coarse polygon annotations for thing instances it gradually incorporated coarse superpixel annotations for stuff regions which were subsequently heuristically amalgamated to yield panoptic segmentation annotations. These annotations executed by different groups of raters have resulted not only in coarse segmentation masks but also in inconsistencies between segmentation types. In this study we undertake a comprehensive reevaluation of the COCO segmentation annotations. By enhancing the annotation quality and expanding the dataset to encompass 383K images with more than 5.18M panoptic masks we introduce COCONut the COCO Next Universal segmenTation dataset. COCONut harmonizes segmentation annotations across semantic instance and panoptic segmentation with meticulously crafted high-quality masks and establishes a robust benchmark for all segmentation tasks. To our knowledge COCONut stands as the inaugural large-scale universal segmentation dataset verified by human raters. We anticipate that the release of COCONut will significantly contribute to the community's ability to assess the progress of novel neural networks",

Specifically we propose an object-centric gating module based on prompt learning to focus attention on the object-centric features guided by the various scene prompts. Then with the object-centric gating masks the dynamic selective module dynamically selects highly correlated feature regions in both spatial and channel dimensions enabling the model to adaptively perceive object-centric relevant features thereby enhancing the generalization capability.

    "abstract": "In the context of pose-invariant object recognition and retrieval we demonstrate that it is possible to achieve significant improvements in performance if both the category-based and the object-identity-based embeddings are learned simultaneously during training. In hindsight that sounds intuitive because learning about the categories is more fundamental than learning about the individual objects that correspond to those categories. However to the best of what we know no prior work in pose invariant learning has demonstrated this effect. This paper presents an attention-based dual-encoder architecture with specially designed loss functions that optimize the inter- and intra-class distances simultaneously in two different embedding spaces one for the category embeddings and the other for the object level embeddings. The loss functions we have proposed are pose-invariant ranking losses that are designed to minimize the intra-class distances and maximize the inter-class distances in the dual representation spaces. We demonstrate the power of our approach with three challenging multi-view datasets ModelNet-40 ObjectPI and FG3D. With our dual approach for single view object recognition we outperform the previous best by 20.0% on ModelNet40 2.0% on ObjectPI and 46.5% on FG3D.

To tackle these issues we propose training free token merging for lightweight video Transformer (vid-TLDR) that aims to enhance the efficiency of video Transformers by merging the background tokens without additional training. For vid-TLDR we introduce a novel approach to capture the salient regions in videos only with the attention map.

    "abstract": "We present DRESS a large vision language model (LVLM) that innovatively exploits Natural Language feedback (NLF) from Large Language Models to enhance its alignment and interactions by addressing two key limitations in the state-of-the-art LVLMs. First prior LVLMs generally rely only on the instruction finetuning stage to enhance alignment with human preferences. Without incorporating extra feedback they are still prone to generate unhelpful hallucinated or harmful responses. Second while the visual instruction tuning data is generally structured in a multi-turn dialogue format the connections and dependencies among consecutive conversational turns are weak. This reduces the capacity for effective multi-turn interactions. To tackle these we propose a novel categorization of the NLF into two key types: critique and refinement. The critique NLF identifies the strengths and weaknesses of the responses and is used to align the LVLMs with human preferences. The refinement NLF offers concrete suggestions for improvement and is adopted to improve the interaction ability of the LVLMs-- which focuses on LVLMs' ability to refine responses by incorporating feedback in multi-turn interactions. To address the non-differentiable nature of NLF we generalize conditional reinforcement learning for training. Our experimental results demonstrate that DRESS can generate more helpful (9.76%) honest (11.52%) and harmless (21.03%) responses and more effectively learn from feedback during multi-turn interactions compared to SOTA LVLMs",

    "abstract": "DETR-like methods have significantly increased detection performance in an end-to-end manner. The mainstream two-stage frameworks of them perform dense self-attention and select a fraction of queries for sparse cross-attention which is proven effective for improving performance but also introduces a heavy computational burden and high dependence on stable query selection. This paper demonstrates that suboptimal two-stage selection strategies result in scale bias and redundancy due to the mismatch between selected queries and objects in two-stage initialization. To address these issues we propose hierarchical salience filtering refinement which performs transformer encoding only on filtered discriminative queries for a better trade-off between computational efficiency and precision. The filtering process overcomes scale bias through a novel scale-independent salience supervision. To compensate for the semantic misalignment among queries we introduce elaborate query refinement modules for stable two-stage initialization. Based on above improvements the proposed Salience DETR achieves significant improvements of +4.0% AP +0.2% AP +4.4% AP on three challenging task-specific detection datasets as well as 49.2% AP on COCO 2017 with less FLOPs.

    "abstract": "We are living in a world surrounded by diverse and \"smart\" devices with rich modalities of sensing ability. Conveniently capturing the interactions between us humans and these objects remains far-reaching. In this paper we present I'm-HOI a monocular scheme to faithfully capture the 3D motions of both the human and object in a novel setting: using a minimal amount of RGB camera and object-mounted Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU). It combines general motion inference and category-aware refinement. For the former we introduce a holistic human-object tracking method to fuse the IMU signals and the RGB stream and progressively recover the human motions and subsequently the companion object motions. For the latter we tailor a category-aware motion diffusion model which is conditioned on both the raw IMU observations and the results from the previous stage under over-parameterization representation. It significantly refines the initial results and generates vivid body hand and object motions. Moreover we contribute a large dataset with ground truth human and object motions dense RGB inputs and rich object-mounted IMU measurements. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of I'm-HOI under a hybrid capture setting. Our dataset and code will be released to the community",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Multi-Instance Learning (MIL) has shown impressive performance for histopathology whole slide image (WSI) analysis using bags or pseudo-bags. It involves instance sampling feature representation and decision-making. However existing MIL-based technologies at least suffer from one or more of the following problems: 1) requiring high storage and intensive pre-processing for numerous instances (sampling); 2) potential over-fitting with limited knowledge to predict bag labels (feature representation); 3) pseudo-bag counts and prior biases affect model robustness and generalizability (decision-making). Inspired by clinical diagnostics using the past sampling instances can facilitate the final WSI analysis but it is barely explored in prior technologies. To break free these limitations we integrate the dynamic instance sampling and reinforcement learning into a unified framework to improve the instance selection and feature aggregation forming a novel Dynamic Policy Instance Selection (DPIS) scheme for better and more credible decision-making. Specifically the measurement of feature distance and reward function are employed to boost continuous instance sampling. To alleviate the over-fitting we explore the latent global relations among instances for more robust and discriminative feature representation while establishing reward and punishment mechanisms to correct biases in pseudo-bags using contrastive learning. These strategies form the final Dynamic Policy-Driven Adaptive Multi-Instance Learning (PAMIL) method for WSI tasks. Extensive experiments reveal that our PAMIL method outperforms the state-of-the-art by 3.8% on CAMELYON16 and 4.4% on TCGA lung cancer datasets",

Despite remarkable progress witnessed in the field of query-based MV3D object detection prior art often suffers from either the lack of exploiting high-resolution 2D features in dense attention-based lifting due to high computational costs or from insufficiently dense grounding of 3D queries to multi-scale 2D features in sparse attention-based lifting. Our proposed MvACon hits the two birds with one stone using a representationally dense yet computationally sparse attentive feature contextualization scheme that is agnostic to specific 2D-to-3D feature lifting approaches. In experiments the proposed MvACon is thoroughly tested on the nuScenes benchmark using both the BEVFormer and its recent 3D deformable attention (DFA3D) variant as well as the PETR showing consistent detection performance improvement especially in enhancing performance in location orientation and velocity prediction. It is also tested on the Waymo-mini benchmark using BEVFormer with similar improvement. We qualitatively and quantitatively show that global cluster-based contexts effectively encode dense scene-level contexts for MV3D object detection.

The core technique of our model is a temporal-aware and noise-resilient prompting scheme. Specifically we employ a space-time memory that contains both spatial and temporal information to prompt the segmentation of current frame and thus we call the proposed model as MemSAM. In prompting the memory carrying temporal cues sequentially prompt the video segmentation frame by frame. Meanwhile as the memory prompt propagates high-level features it avoids the issue of misidentification caused by mask propagation and improves representation consistency. To address the challenge of speckle noise we further propose a memory reinforcement mechanism which leverages predicted masks to improve the quality of the memory before storing it. We extensively evaluate our method on two public datasets and demonstrate state-of-the-art performance compared to existing models.

In light of this we propose LiDAR4D a differentiable LiDAR-only framework for novel space-time LiDAR view synthesis.

In this paper we present PI3D a framework that fully leverages the pre-trained text-to-image diffusion models' ability to generate high-quality 3D shapes from text prompts in minutes. The core idea is to connect the 2D and 3D domains by representing a 3D shape as a set of Pseudo RGB Images. We fine-tune an existing text-to-image diffusion model to produce such pseudo-images using a small number of text-3D pairs. Surprisingly we find that it can already generate meaningful and consistent 3D shapes given complex text descriptions. We further take the generated shapes as the starting point for a lightweight iterative refinement using score distillation sampling to achieve high-quality generation under a low budget. PI3D generates a single 3D shape from text in only 3 minutes and the quality is validated to outperform existing 3D generative models by a large margin",

While existing methods facilitate high-fidelity customization for individual concepts or a limited pre-defined set of them they fall short of achieving scalability where a single model can seamlessly render countless concepts. In this paper we address a new problem called Modular Customization with the goal of efficiently merging customized models that were fine-tuned independently for individual concepts. This allows the merged model to jointly synthesize concepts in one image without compromising fidelity or incurring any additional computational costs. To address this problem we introduce Orthogonal Adaptation a method designed to encourage the customized models which do not have access to each other during fine-tuning to have orthogonal residual weights. This ensures that during inference time the customized models can be summed with minimal interference. Our proposed method is both simple and versatile applicable to nearly all optimizable weights in the model architecture. Through an extensive set of quantitative and qualitative evaluations our method consistently outperforms relevant baselines in terms of efficiency and identity preservation demonstrating a significant leap toward scalable customization of diffusion models",

Instead of training a task-specific diffusion model for each new task DNO operates by optimizing the diffusion latent noise of an existing pre-trained text-to-motion model. Given the corresponding latent noise of a human motion it propagates the gradient from the target criteria defined on the motion space through the whole denoising process to update the diffusion latent noise. As a result DNO supports any use cases where criteria can be defined as a function of motion. In particular we show that for motion editing and control DNO outperforms existing methods in both achieving the objective and preserving the motion content. DNO accommodates a diverse range of editing modes including changing trajectory pose joint locations or avoiding newly added obstacles. In addition DNO is effective in motion denoising and completion producing smooth and realistic motion from noisy and partial inputs. DNO achieves these results at inference time without the need for model retraining offering great versatility for any defined reward or loss function on the motion representation",

It entails not only authorizing usage but also ensuring the deployment of models in authorized data domains i.e. making models exclusive to certain target domains. Previous methods necessitate concurrent access to source training data and target unauthorized data when performing IP protection making them risky and inefficient for decentralized private data. In this paper we target a practical setting where only a well-trained source model is available and investigate how we can realize IP protection. To achieve this we propose a novel MAsk Pruning (MAP) framework. MAP stems from an intuitive hypothesis i.e. there are target-related parameters in a well-trained model locating and pruning them is the key to IP protection. Technically MAP freezes the source model and learns a target-specific binary mask to prevent unauthorized data usage while minimizing performance degradation on authorized data. Moreover we introduce a new metric aimed at achieving a better balance between source and target performance degradation. To verify the effectiveness and versatility we have evaluated MAP in a variety of scenarios including vanilla source-available practical source-free and challenging data-free.

This highlights the importance of domain diversification in improving the performance of object detectors.

    "abstract": "In the realm of food computing segmenting ingredients from images poses substantial challenges due to the large intra-class variance among the same ingredients the emergence of new ingredients and the high annotation costs associated with large food segmentation datasets. Existing approaches primarily utilize a closed-vocabulary and static text embeddings setting. These methods often fall short in effectively handling the ingredients particularly new and diverse ones. In response to these limitations we introduce OVFoodSeg a framework that adopts an open-vocabulary setting and enhances text embeddings with visual context. By integrating vision-language models (VLMs) our approach enriches text embedding with image-specific information through two innovative modules e.g. an image-to-text learner FoodLearner and an Image-Informed Text Encoder. The training process of OVFoodSeg is divided into two stages: the pre-training of FoodLearner and the subsequent learning phase for segmentation. The pre-training phase equips FoodLearner with the capability to align visual information with corresponding textual representations that are specifically related to food while the second phase adapts both the FoodLearner and the Image-Informed Text Encoder for the segmentation task. By addressing the deficiencies of previous models OVFoodSeg demonstrates a significant improvement achieving an 4.9% increase in mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) on the FoodSeg103 dataset setting a new milestone for food image segmentation",

    "abstract": "We introduce a lightweight and accurate architecture for resource-efficient visual correspondence. Our method dubbed XFeat (Accelerated Features) revisits fundamental design choices in convolutional neural networks for detecting extracting and matching local features. Our new model satisfies a critical need for fast and robust algorithms suitable to resource-limited devices. In particular accurate image matching requires sufficiently large image resolutions -- for this reason we keep the resolution as large as possible while limiting the number of channels in the network. Besides our model is designed to offer the choice of matching at the sparse or semi-dense levels each of which may be more suitable for different downstream applications such as visual navigation and augmented reality. Our model is the first to offer semi-dense matching efficiently leveraging a novel match refinement module that relies on coarse local descriptors. XFeat is versatile and hardware-independent surpassing current deep learning-based local features in speed (up to 5x faster) with comparable or better accuracy proven in pose estimation and visual localization. We showcase it running in real-time on an inexpensive laptop CPU without specialized hardware optimizations. Code and weights are available at verlab.dcc.ufmg.br/descriptors/xfeat_cvpr24",

    "abstract": "The emergence of attention-based transformer models has led to their extensive use in various tasks due to their superior generalization and transfer properties. Recent research has demonstrated that such models when prompted appropriately are excellent for few-shot inference. However such techniques are under-explored for dense prediction tasks like semantic segmentation. In this work we examine the effectiveness of prompting a transformer-decoder with learned visual prompts for the generalized few-shot segmentation (GFSS) task. Our goal is to achieve strong performance not only on novel categories with limited examples but also to retain performance on base categories. We propose an approach to learn visual prompts with limited examples. These learned visual prompts are used to prompt a multiscale transformer decoder to facilitate accurate dense predictions. Additionally we introduce a unidirectional causal attention mechanism between the novel prompts learned with limited examples and the base prompts learned with abundant data. This mechanism enriches the novel prompts without deteriorating the base class performance. Overall this form of prompting helps us achieve state-of-the-art performance for GFSS on two different benchmark datasets: COCO-20^i and Pascal-5^i without the need for test-time optimization (or transduction). Furthermore test-time optimization leveraging unlabelled test data can be used to improve the prompts which we refer to as transductive prompt tuning",

Conventional 3D scene perception methods are offline i.e. take an already reconstructed 3D scene geometry as input which is not applicable in robotic applications where the input data is streaming RGB-D videos rather than a complete 3D scene reconstructed from pre- collected RGB-D videos. To deal with online 3D scene per- ception tasks where data collection and perception should be performed simultaneously the model should be able to process 3D scenes frame by frame and make use of the temporal information. To this end we propose an adapter-based plug-and-play module for the backbone of 3D scene perception model which constructs memory to cache and aggregate the extracted RGB-D features to empower offline models with temporal learning ability. Specifically we propose a queued memory mechanism to cache the supporting point cloud and image features. Then we devise aggregation modules which directly perform on the memory and pass temporal information to current frame. We further propose 3D-to-2D adapter to enhance image features with strong global context. Our adapters can be easily inserted into mainstream offline architectures of different tasks and significantly boost their performance on online tasks. Extensive experiments on ScanNet and SceneNN datasets demonstrate our approach achieves leading performance on three 3D scene perception tasks compared with state-of-the-art online methods by simply finetuning existing offline models without any model and task-specific designs",

    "abstract": "Vision-language models (VLMs) have made significant strides in cross-modal understanding through large-scale paired datasets. However in fashion domain datasets often exhibit a disparity between the information conveyed in image and text. This issue stems from datasets containing multiple images of a single fashion item all paired with one text leading to cases where some textual details are not visible in individual images. This mismatch particularly when non-co-occurring elements are masked undermines the training of conventional VLM objectives like Masked Language Modeling and Masked Image Modeling thereby hindering the model's ability to accurately align fine-grained visual and textual features. Addressing this problem we propose Synchronized attentional Masking (SyncMask) which generate masks that pinpoint the image patches and word tokens where the information co-occur in both image and text. This synchronization is accomplished by harnessing cross-attentional features obtained from a momentum model ensuring a precise alignment between the two modalities. Additionally we enhance grouped batch sampling with semi-hard negatives effectively mitigating false negative issues in Image-Text Matching and Image-Text Contrastive learning objectives within fashion datasets.

    "abstract": "Advanced Audio-Visual Speech Recognition (AVSR) systems have been observed to be sensitive to missing video frames performing even worse than single-modality models. While applying the common dropout techniques to the video modality enhances robustness to missing frames it simultaneously results in a performance loss when dealing with complete data input. In this study we delve into this contrasting phenomenon through the lens of modality bias and uncover that an excessive modality bias towards the audio modality induced by dropout constitutes the fundamental cause. Next we present the Modality Bias Hypothesis (MBH) to systematically describe the relationship between the modality bias and the robustness against missing modality in multimodal systems. Building on these findings we propose a novel Multimodal Distribution Approximation with Knowledge Distillation (MDA-KD) framework to reduce over-reliance on the audio modality maintaining performance and robustness simultaneously. Finally to address an entirely missing modality we adopt adapters to dynamically switch decision strategies.

    "abstract": "Point cloud upsampling (PCU) enriches the representation of raw point clouds significantly improving the performance in downstream tasks such as classification and reconstruction. Most of the existing point cloud upsampling methods focus on sparse point cloud feature extraction and upsampling module design. In a different way we dive deeper into directly modelling the gradient of data distribution from dense point clouds. In this paper we proposed a conditional denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) for point cloud upsampling called PUDM. Specifically PUDM treats the sparse point cloud as a condition and iteratively learns the transformation relationship between the dense point cloud and the noise. Simultaneously PUDM aligns with a dual mapping paradigm to further improve the discernment of point features. In this context PUDM enables learning complex geometry details in the ground truth through the dominant features while avoiding an additional upsampling module design. Furthermore to generate high-quality arbitrary-scale point clouds during inference PUDM exploits the prior knowledge of the scale between sparse point clouds and dense point clouds during training by parameterizing a rate factor. Moreover PUDM exhibits strong noise robustness in experimental results. In the quantitative and qualitative evaluations on PU1K and PUGAN PUDM significantly outperformed existing methods in terms of Chamfer Distance (CD) and Hausdorff Distance (HD) achieving state of the art (SOTA) performance",

However rendering dynamic long-duration radiance fields on ubiquitous devices remains challenging due to data storage and computational constraints. In this paper we introduce VideoRF the first approach to enable real-time streaming and rendering of dynamic human-centric radiance fields on mobile platforms. At the core is a serialized 2D feature image stream representing the 4D radiance field all in one. We introduce a tailored training scheme directly applied to this 2D domain to impose the temporal and spatial redundancy of the feature image stream. By leveraging the redundancy we show that the feature image stream can be efficiently compressed by 2D video codecs which allows us to exploit video hardware accelerators to achieve real-time decoding. On the other hand based on the feature image stream we propose a novel rendering pipeline for VideoRF which has specialized space mappings to query radiance properties efficiently. Paired with a deferred shading model VideoRF has the capability of real-time rendering on mobile devices thanks to its efficiency. We have developed a real-time interactive player that enables online streaming and rendering of dynamic scenes offering a seamless and immersive free-viewpoint experience across a range of devices from desktops to mobile phones.

    "abstract": "Previous methods for Video Frame Interpolation (VFI) have encountered challenges notably the manifestation of blur and ghosting effects. These issues can be traced back to two pivotal factors: unavoidable motion errors and misalignment in supervision. In practice motion estimates often prove to be error-prone resulting in misaligned features. Furthermore the reconstruction loss tends to bring blurry results particularly in misaligned regions. To mitigate these challenges we propose a new paradigm called PerVFI (Perception-oriented Video Frame Interpolation). Our approach incorporates an Asymmetric Synergistic Blending module (ASB) that utilizes features from both sides to synergistically blend intermediate features. One reference frame emphasizes primary content while the other contributes complementary information. To impose a stringent constraint on the blending process we introduce a self-learned sparse quasi-binary mask which effectively mitigates ghosting and blur artifacts in the output. Additionally we employ a normalizing flow-based generator and utilize the negative log-likelihood loss to learn the conditional distribution of the output which further facilitates the generation of clear and fine details. Experimental results validate the superiority of PerVFI demonstrating significant improvements in perceptual quality compared to existing methods.

Yet current protection methods work under the assumption that these protected images are not changed which is in contradiction to the fact that most public platforms intend to modify user-uploaded content e.g. image compression. This paper introduces a robust watermarking method namely InMark to protect images from unauthorized learning. Inspired by influence functions the proposed method forges protective watermarks on more important pixels for these reference images from both heuristic and statistical perspectives.

However UDFs are non-differentiable at the zero level set which leads to significant errors in distances and gradients generally resulting in fragmented and discontinuous surfaces. In this paper we propose to learn a hyperbolic scaling of the unsigned distance field which defines a new Eikonal problem with distinct boundary conditions. This allows our formulation to integrate seamlessly with state-of-the-art continuously differentiable implicit neural representation networks largely applied in the literature to represent signed distance fields. Our approach not only addresses the challenge of open surface representation but also demonstrates significant improvement in reconstruction quality and training performance. Moreover the unlocked field's differentiability allows the accurate computation of essential topological properties such as normal directions and curvatures pervasive in downstream tasks such as rendering. Through extensive experiments we validate our approach across various data sets and against competitive baselines.

    "abstract": "The vision-language model has brought great improvement to few-shot industrial anomaly detection which usually needs to design of hundreds of prompts through prompt engineering. For automated scenarios we first use conventional prompt learning with many-class paradigm as the baseline to automatically learn prompts but found that it can not work well in one-class anomaly detection. To address the above problem this paper proposes a one-class prompt learning method for few-shot anomaly detection termed PromptAD. First we propose semantic concatenation which can transpose normal prompts into anomaly prompts by concatenating normal prompts with anomaly suffixes thus constructing a large number of negative samples used to guide prompt learning in one-class setting. Furthermore to mitigate the training challenge caused by the absence of anomaly images we introduce the concept of explicit anomaly margin which is used to explicitly control the margin between normal prompt features and anomaly prompt features through a hyper-parameter. For image-level/pixel-level anomaly detection PromptAD achieves first place in 11/12 few-shot settings on MVTec and VisA",

Its core idea is to amplify feature similarities between the positive sample pairs and reduce them between the negative sample pairs.

This is primarily attributed to two limitations of positive sampling that is incomplete local sampling and blind sampling. To address these limitations this paper introduces a novel GCL framework with an adaptive positive sampling module named grapH contrastivE Adaptive posiTive Samples (HEATS). Motivated by the observation that the affinity matrix corresponding to optimal positive sample sets has a block-diagonal structure with equal weights within each block a self-expressive learning objective incorporating the block and idempotent constraint is presented.

While this simplicity is attractive it is necessary to train such models on large and varied datasets which are difficult to capture. It has been shown that using embeddings from pre-trained foundational models such as CLIP improves zero shot transfer in several applications. Taking inspiration from this in our paper we explore the use of global image priors generated from a pre-trained ViT model to provide more detailed contextual information. We argue that the embedding vector from a ViT model pre-trained on a large dataset captures greater relevant information for SIDE than the usual route of generating pseudo image captions followed by CLIP based text embeddings. Based on this idea we propose a new SIDE model using a diffusion backbone which is conditioned on ViT embeddings. Our proposed design establishes a new state-of-the-art (SOTA) for SIDE on NYUv2 dataset achieving Abs Rel error of 0.059(14% improvement) compared to 0.069 by the current SOTA (VPD). And on KITTI dataset achieving Sq Rel error of 0.139 (2% improvement) compared to 0.142 by the current SOTA (GEDepth).

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Recently building on the foundation of neural radiance field various techniques have emerged to learn unsigned distance fields (UDF) to reconstruct 3D non-watertight models from multi-view images. Yet a central challenge in UDF-based volume rendering is formulating a proper way to convert unsigned distance values into volume density ensuring that the resulting weight function remains unbiased and sensitive to occlusions. Falling short on these requirements often results in incorrect topology or large reconstruction errors in resulting models. This paper addresses this challenge by presenting a novel two-stage algorithm 2S-UDF for learning a high-quality UDF from multi-view images. Initially the method applies an easily trainable density function that while slightly biased and transparent aids in coarse reconstruction. The subsequent stage then refines the geometry and appearance of the object to achieve a high-quality reconstruction by directly adjusting the weight function used in volume rendering to ensure that it is unbiased and occlusion-aware. Decoupling density and weight in two stages makes our training stable and robust distinguishing our technique from existing UDF learning approaches. Evaluations on the DeepFashion3D DTU and BlendedMVS datasets validate the robustness and effectiveness of our proposed approach. In both quantitative metrics and visual quality the results indicate our superior performance over other UDF learning techniques in reconstructing 3D non-watertight models from multi-view images.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "The YOLO series has become the most popular framework for real-time object detection due to its reasonable trade-off between speed and accuracy. However we observe that the speed and accuracy of YOLOs are negatively affected by the NMS. Recently end-to-end Transformer-based detectors (DETRs) have provided an alternative to eliminating NMS. Nevertheless the high computational cost limits their practicality and hinders them from fully exploiting the advantage of excluding NMS. In this paper we propose the Real-Time DEtection TRansformer (RT-DETR) the first real-time end-to-end object detector to our best knowledge that addresses the above dilemma. We build RT-DETR in two steps drawing on the advanced DETR: first we focus on maintaining accuracy while improving speed followed by maintaining speed while improving accuracy. Specifically we design an efficient hybrid encoder to expeditiously process multi-scale features by decoupling intra-scale interaction and cross-scale fusion to improve speed. Then we propose the uncertainty-minimal query selection to provide high-quality initial queries to the decoder thereby improving accuracy. In addition RT-DETR supports flexible speed tuning by adjusting the number of decoder layers to adapt to various scenarios without retraining. Our RT-DETR-R50 / R101 achieves 53.1% / 54.3% AP on COCO and 108 / 74 FPS on T4 GPU outperforming previously advanced YOLOs in both speed and accuracy. We also develop scaled RT-DETRs that outperform the lighter YOLO detectors (S and M models). Furthermore RT-DETR-R50 outperforms DINO-R50 by 2.2% AP in accuracy and about 21 times in FPS. After pre-training with Objects365 RT-DETR-R50 / R101 achieves 55.3% / 56.2% AP. The project page: https://zhao-yian.github.io/RTDETR",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Despite the recent advances in unified image segmentation (IS) developing a unified video segmentation (VS) model remains a challenge. This is mainly because generic category-specified VS tasks need to detect all objects and track them across consecutive frames while prompt-guided VS tasks require re-identifying the target with visual/text prompts throughout the entire video making it hard to handle the different tasks with the same architecture. We make an attempt to address these issues and present a novel unified VS architecture namely UniVS by using prompts as queries. UniVS averages the prompt features of the target from previous frames as its initial query to explicitly decode masks and introduces a target-wise prompt cross-attention layer in the mask decoder to integrate prompt features in the memory pool. By taking the predicted masks of entities from previous frames as their visual prompts UniVS converts different VS tasks into prompt-guided target segmentation eliminating the heuristic inter-frame matching process. Our framework not only unifies the different VS tasks but also naturally achieves universal training and testing ensuring robust performance across different scenarios. UniVS shows a commendable balance between performance and universality on 10 challenging VS benchmarks covering video instance semantic panoptic object and referring segmentation tasks.

In this work instead of solely using representations from CLIP we fill the gap by proposing a spatial adapter that efficiently utilizes the multi-scale spatial information in the pre-trained detector. This leads to a bilateral adaptation that mutually produces complementary features. To further improve interaction recognition under occlusion which is common in crowded scenarios we propose an Occluded Part Extrapolation module that guides the model to recover the spatial details from manually occluded feature maps. Moreover we design a Conditional Contextual Mining module that further mines informative contextual clues from the spatial features via a tailored cross-attention mechanism.

To circumvent these challenges here we introduce a novel architectural method for FedDG namely gPerXAN which relies on a normalization scheme working with a guiding regularizer. In particular we carefully design Personalized eXplicitly Assembled Normalization to enforce client models selectively filtering domain-specific features that are biased towards local data while retaining discrimination of those features.

    "abstract": "Recovering a clear image from a single hazy image is an open inverse problem. Although significant research progress has been made most existing methods ignore the effect that downstream tasks play in promoting upstream dehazing. From the perspective of the haze generation mechanism there is a potential relationship between the depth information of the scene and the hazy image. Based on this we propose a dual-task collaborative mutual promotion framework to achieve the dehazing of a single image. This framework integrates depth estimation and dehazing by a dual-task interaction mechanism and achieves mutual enhancement of their performance. To realize the joint optimization of the two tasks an alternative implementation mechanism with the difference perception is developed. On the one hand the difference perception between the depth maps of the dehazing result and the ideal image is proposed to promote the dehazing network to pay attention to the non-ideal areas of the dehazing. On the other hand by improving the depth estimation performance in the difficult-to-recover areas of the hazy image the dehazing network can explicitly use the depth information of the hazy image to assist the clear image recovery. To promote the depth estimation we propose to use the difference between the dehazed image and the ground truth to guide the depth estimation network to focus on the dehazed unideal areas. It allows dehazing and depth estimation to leverage their strengths in a mutually reinforcing manner. Experimental results show that the proposed method can achieve better performance than that of the state-of-the-art approaches. The source code is released at https://github.com/zhoushen1/DCMPNet",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "We propose a unified approach to simultaneously addressing the conventional setting of binary deepfake classification and a more challenging scenario of uncovering what facial components have been forged as well as the exact order of the manipulations. To solve the former task we consider multiple instance learning (MIL) that takes each image as a bag and its patches as instances. A positive bag corresponds to a forged image that includes at least one manipulated patch (i.e. a pixel in the feature map). The formulation allows us to estimate the probability of an input image being a fake one and establish the corresponding contrastive MIL loss. On the other hand tackling the component-wise deepfake problem can be reduced to solving multi-label prediction but the requirement to recover the manipulation order further complicates the learning task into a multi-label ranking problem. We resolve this difficulty by designing a tailor-made loss term to enforce that the rank order of the predicted multi-label probabilities respects the ground-truth order of the sequential modifications of a deepfake image. Through extensive experiments and comparisons with other relevant techniques we provide extensive results and ablation studies to demonstrate that the proposed method is an overall more comprehensive solution to deepfake detection",

    "abstract": "The recent advent of pre-trained vision transformers has unveiled a promising property: their inherent capability to group semantically related visual concepts. In this paper we explore to harnesses this emergent feature to tackle few-shot semantic segmentation a task focused on classifying pixels in a test image with a few example data. A critical hurdle in this endeavor is preventing overfitting to the limited classes seen during training the few-shot segmentation model. As our main discovery we find that the concept of \"relationship descriptors\" initially conceived for enhancing the CLIP model for zero-shot semantic segmentation offers a potential solution. We adapt and refine this concept to craft a relationship descriptor construction tailored for few-shot semantic segmentation extending its application across multiple layers to enhance performance. Building upon this adaptation we proposed a few-shot semantic segmentation framework that is not only easy to implement and train but also effectively scales with the number of support examples and categories. Through rigorous experimentation across various datasets including PASCAL-5^ i and COCO-20^ i we demonstrate a clear advantage of our method in diverse few-shot semantic segmentation scenarios and a range of pre-trained vision transformer models. The findings clearly show that our method significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art techniques highlighting the effectiveness of harnessing the emerging capabilities of vision transformers for few-shot semantic segmentation.

    "abstract": "Listening head generation aims to synthesize a non-verbal responsive listener head by modeling the correlation between the speaker and the listener in dynamic conversion. The applications of listener agent generation in virtual interaction have promoted many works achieving diverse and fine-grained motion generation. However they can only manipulate motions through simple emotional labels but cannot freely control the listener's motions. Since listener agents should have human-like attributes (e.g. identity personality) which can be freely customized by users this limits their realism. In this paper we propose a user-friendly framework called CustomListener to realize the free-form text prior guided listener generation. To achieve speaker-listener coordination we design a Static to Dynamic Portrait module (SDP) which interacts with speaker information to transform static text into dynamic portrait token with completion rhythm and amplitude information. To achieve coherence between segments we design a Past Guided Generation module (PGG) to maintain the consistency of customized listener attributes through the motion prior and utilize a diffusion-based structure conditioned on the portrait token and the motion prior to realize the controllable generation. To train and evaluate our model we have constructed two text-annotated listening head datasets based on ViCo and RealTalk which provide text-video paired labels.

    "abstract": "Adding artificial patterns to objects like QR codes can ease tasks such as object tracking robot navigation and conveying information (e.g. a label or a website link). However these patterns require a physical application and they alter the object's appearance. Conversely projected patterns can temporarily change the object's appearance aiding tasks like 3D scanning and retrieving object textures and shading. However projected patterns impede dynamic tasks like object tracking because they do not `stick' to the object's surface. Or do they? This paper introduces a novel approach combining the advantages of projected and persistent physical patterns. Our system projects heat patterns using a laser beam (similar in spirit to a LIDAR) which a thermal camera observes and tracks. Such thermal patterns enable tracking poorly-textured objects whose tracking is highly challenging with standard cameras while not affecting the object's appearance or physical properties. To avail these thermal patterns in existing vision frameworks we train a network to reverse heat diffusion's effects and remove inconsistent pattern points between different thermal frames. We prototyped and tested this approach on dynamic vision tasks like structure from motion optical flow and object tracking of everyday textureless objects",

The alignment between 3D scene graphs is the first step of many downstream tasks such as scene graph aided point cloud registration mosaicking overlap checking and robot navigation. In this work we treat 3D scene graph alignment as a partial graph-matching problem and propose to solve it with a graph neural network. We reuse the geometric features learned by a point cloud registration method and associate the clustered point-level geometric features with the node-level semantic feature via our designed feature fusion module. Partial matching is enabled by using a learnable method to select the top-k similar node pairs. Subsequent downstream tasks such as point cloud registration are achieved by running a pre-trained registration network within the matched regions. We further propose a point-matching rescoring method that uses the node-wise alignment of the 3D scene graph to reweight the matching candidates from a pre-trained point cloud registration method. It reduces the false point correspondences estimated especially in low-overlapping cases. Experiments show that our method improves the alignment accuracy by 10 20% in low-overlap and random transformation scenarios and outperforms the existing work in multiple downstream tasks.

In this work we present a unifying formalism for PCA and its variants and introduce a framework based on the flags of linear subspaces i.e. a hierarchy of nested linear subspaces of increasing dimension which not only allows for a common implementation but also yields novel variants not explored previously. We begin by generalizing traditional PCA methods that either maximize variance or minimize reconstruction error. We expand these interpretations to develop a wide array of new dimensionality reduction algorithms by accounting for outliers and the data manifold. To devise a common computational approach we recast robust and dual forms of PCA as optimization problems on flag manifolds. We then integrate tangent space approximations of principal geodesic analysis (tangent-PCA) into this flag-based framework creating novel robust and dual geodesic PCA variations. The remarkable flexibility offered by the `flagification' introduced here enables even more algorithmic variants identified by specific flag types. Last but not least we propose an effective convergent solver for these flag-formulations employing the Stiefel manifold.

    "abstract": "Despite the success of recent upsampling approaches generating high-resolution point sets with uniform distribution and meticulous structures is still challenging. Unlike existing methods that only take spatial information of the raw data into account we regard point cloud upsampling as generating dense point clouds from deformable topology. Motivated by this we present SPU-PMD a self-supervised topological mesh deformation network for 3D densification. As a cascaded framework our architecture is formulated by a series of coarse mesh interpolator and mesh deformers. At each stage the mesh interpolator first produces the initial dense point clouds via mesh interpolation which allows the model to perceive the primitive topology better. Meanwhile the deformer infers the morphing by estimating the movements of mesh nodes and reconstructs the descriptive topology structure. By associating mesh deformation with feature expansion this module progressively refines point clouds' surface uniformity and structural details. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments are conducted on synthetic and real-scanned 3D data.

To do that we first extend the EDM framework to take into account spatially and temporally redundant pixels and naturally support video generation. Second we show that a U-Net--a workhorse behind image generation--scales poorly when generating videos requiring significant computational overhead. Hence we propose a new transformer-based architecture that trains 3.31 times faster than U-Nets (and is 4.5 faster at inference). This allows us to efficiently train a text-to-video model with billions of parameters for the first time reach state-of-the-art results on a number of benchmarks and generate videos with substantially higher quality temporal consistency and motion complexity.

Our approach leverages the insight that both the gradients and wrapped gradients of wrapped phases serve as noisy labels for GT phase gradients along with sparse outliers induced by the wrapping operation. A recorruption-based self-reconstruction loss in the gradient domain is proposed to mitigate the adverse effects of label noise complemented with a self-distillation loss for improved generalization. Additionally by unfolding a variational model of PU that utilizes wrapped gradients of wrapped phases for its data-fitting term we develop a deep unrolling network that encodes physics of phase wrapping and incorporates special treatments on outliers.

To meet the recent decentralization trend in the community we introduce a practical yet challenging task Federated GCD (Fed-GCD) where the training data are distributed in local clients and cannot be shared among clients. Fed-GCD aims to train a generic GCD model by client collaboration under the privacy-protected constraint. The Fed-GCD leads to two challenges: 1) representation degradation caused by training each client model with fewer data than centralized GCD learning and 2) highly heterogeneous label spaces across different clients. To this end we propose a novel Associated Gaussian Contrastive Learning (AGCL) framework based on learnable GMMs which consists of a Client Semantics Association (CSA) and a global-local GMM Contrastive Learning (GCL). On the server CSA aggregates the heterogeneous categories of local-client GMMs to generate a global GMM containing more comprehensive category knowledge. On each client GCL builds class-level contrastive learning with both local and global GMMs. The local GCL learns robust representation with limited local data. The global GCL encourages the model to produce more discriminative representation with the comprehensive category relationships that may not exist in local data. We build a benchmark based on six visual datasets to facilitate the study of Fed-GCD. Extensive experiments show that our AGCL outperforms multiple baselines on all datasets",

Our algorithm determines for each test input which pre-trained models in the model zoo are capable of identifying the test input as an OOD sample. If no such models exist in the model zoo the test input is classified as an in-distribution (ID) sample. We theoretically demonstrate that our method maintains the true positive rate of ID samples and accurately identifies OOD samples with high probability when there are a sufficient number of diverse pre-trained models in the model zoo. Extensive experiments were conducted to validate our method demonstrating that it leverages the complementarity among single-model detectors to consistently improve the effectiveness of OOD sample identification.

Previous camera-based collaborative 3D perception methods typically employ 3D bounding boxes or bird's eye views as representations of the environment. However these approaches fall short in offering a comprehensive 3D environmental prediction. To bridge this gap we introduce the first method for collaborative 3D semantic occupancy prediction. Particularly it improves local 3D semantic occupancy predictions by hybrid fusion of (i) semantic and occupancy task features and (ii) compressed orthogonal attention features shared between vehicles. Additionally due to the lack of a collaborative perception dataset designed for semantic occupancy prediction we augment a current collaborative perception dataset to include 3D collaborative semantic occupancy labels for a more robust evaluation. The experimental findings highlight that: (i) our collaborative semantic occupancy predictions excel above the results from single vehicles by over 30% and (ii) models anchored on semantic occupancy outpace state-of-the-art collaborative 3D detection techniques in subsequent perception applications showcasing enhanced accuracy and enriched semantic-awareness in road environments",

    "abstract": "In class incremental learning (CIL) scenarios the phenomenon of catastrophic forgetting caused by the classifier's bias towards the current task has long posed a significant challenge. It is mainly caused by the characteristic of discriminative models. With the growing popularity of the generative multi-modal models we would explore replacing discriminative models with generative ones for CIL. However transitioning from discriminative to generative models requires addressing two key challenges. The primary challenge lies in transferring the generated textual information into the classification of distinct categories. Additionally it requires formulating the task of CIL within a generative framework. To this end we propose a novel generative multi-modal model (GMM) framework for class incremental learning. Our approach directly generates labels for images using an adapted generative model. After obtaining the detailed text we use a text encoder to extract text features and employ feature matching to determine the most similar label as the classification prediction. In the conventional CIL settings we achieve significantly better results in long-sequence task scenarios. Under the Few-shot CIL setting we have improved by at least 14% over the current state-of-the-art methods with significantly less forgetting",

    "abstract": "Low-resource settings are well-established in natural lan- guage processing where many languages lack sufficient data for deep learning at scale. However low-resource problems are under-explored in computer vision. In this paper we address this gap and explore the challenges of low-resource image tasks with vision foundation models. We first collect a benchmark of genuinely low-resource image data covering historic maps circuit diagrams and mechanical drawings. These low-resource settings all share three challenges: data scarcity fine-grained differences and the distribution shift from natural images to the specialized domain of interest. While existing foundation models have shown impressive generalizability we find they cannot transfer well to our low-resource tasks. To begin to tackle the challenges of low-resource vision we introduce one simple baseline per challenge. Specifically we i) enlarge the data space by generative models ii) adopt the best sub-kernels to encode local regions for fine-grained difference discovery and iii) learn attention for specialized domains. Experiments on our three low-resource tasks demonstrate our proposals already provide a better baseline than transfer learning data aug- mentation and fine-grained methods. This highlights the unique characteristics and challenges of low-resource vision for foundation models that warrant further investigation.

The dataset is annotated with object masks real-world scale camera poses and reconstructed aggregated point clouds from RGBD videos. We benchmark four tasks with WildRGB-D including novel view synthesis camera pose estimation object 6d pose estimation and object surface reconstruction.

This paper made a progressive stride toward generalizable tumor synthesis by leveraging a critical observation: early-stage tumors (< 2cm) tend to have similar imaging characteristics in computed tomography (CT) whether they originate in the liver pancreas or kidneys. We have ascertained that generative AI models e.g. Diffusion Models can create realistic tumors generalized to a range of organs even when trained on a limited number of tumor examples from only one organ.

Recent methods that introduce 3D global representation into diffusion models have shown the potential to generate consistent multiviews but they have reduced generation speed and face challenges in maintaining generalizability and quality. To address this issue we propose EpiDiff a localized interactive multiview diffusion model. At the core of the proposed approach is to insert a lightweight epipolar attention block into the frozen diffusion model leveraging epipolar constraints to enable cross-view interaction among feature maps of neighboring views. The newly initialized 3D modeling module preserves the original feature distribution of the diffusion model exhibiting compatibility with a variety of base diffusion models. Experiments show that EpiDiff generates 16 multiview images in just 12 seconds and it surpasses previous methods in quality evaluation metrics including PSNR SSIM and LPIPS. Additionally EpiDiff can generate a more diverse distribution of views improving the reconstruction quality from generated multiviews.

To evaluate faithfulness we introduce Salience-guided Faithfulness Coefficient (SaCo) a novel evaluation metric leveraging essential information of salience distribution. Specifically we conduct pair-wise comparisons among distinct pixel groups and then aggregate the differences in their salience scores resulting in a coefficient that indicates the explanation's degree of faithfulness. Our explorations reveal that current metrics struggle to differentiate between advanced explanation methods and Random Attribution thereby failing to capture the faithfulness property.

    "abstract": "Establishing precise semantic correspondence across object instances in different images is a fundamental and challenging task in computer vision. In this task difficulty arises often due to three challenges: confusing regions with similar appearance inconsistent object scale and indistinguishable nearby pixels. Recognizing these challenges our paper proposes a novel semantic matching pipeline named LPMFlow toward extracting fine-grained semantics and geometry layouts for building pixel-level semantic correspondences. LPMFlow consists of three modules each addressing one of the aforementioned challenges. The layout-aware representation learning module uniformly encodes source and target tokens to distinguish pixels or regions with similar appearances but different geometry semantics. The progressive feature superresolution module outputs four sets of 4D correlation tensors to generate accurate semantic flow between objects in different scales. Finally the matching flow integration and refinement module is exploited to fuse matching flow in different scales to give the final flow predictions. The whole pipeline can be trained end-to-end with a balance of computational cost and correspondence details. Extensive experiments based on benchmarks such as SPair-71K PF-PASCAL and PF-WILLOW have proved that the proposed method can well tackle the three challenges and outperform the previous methods especially in more stringent settings.

Prevailing approaches involve learning WSIs as instance-bag representations emphasizing significant instances but struggling to capture the interactions between instances. Additionally conventional graph representation methods utilize explicit spatial positions to construct topological structures but restrict the flexible interaction capabilities between instances at arbitrary locations particularly when spatially distant. In response we propose a novel dynamic graph representation algorithm that conceptualizes WSIs as a form of the knowledge graph structure. Specifically we dynamically construct neighbors and directed edge embeddings based on the head and tail relationships between instances. Then we devise a knowledge-aware attention mechanism that can update the head node features by learning the joint attention score of each neighbor and edge. Finally we obtain a graph-level embedding through the global pooling process of the updated head serving as an implicit representation for the WSI classification.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "This paper addresses an interesting yet challenging problem-- source-free unsupervised domain adaptation (SFUDA) for pinhole-to-panoramic semantic segmentation--given only a pinhole image-trained model (i.e. source) and unlabeled panoramic images (i.e. target). Tackling this problem is nontrivial due to the semantic mismatches style discrepancies and inevitable distortion of panoramic images. To this end we propose a novel method that utilizes Tangent Projection (TP) as it has less distortion and meanwhile slits the equirectangular projection (ERP) with a fixed FoV to mimic the pinhole images. Both projections are shown effective in extracting knowledge from the source model. However the distinct projection discrepancies between source and target domains impede the direct knowledge transfer; thus we propose a panoramic prototype adaptation module (PPAM) to integrate panoramic prototypes from the extracted knowledge for adaptation. We then impose the loss constraints on both predictions and prototypes and propose a cross-dual attention module (CDAM) at the feature level to better align the spatial and channel characteristics across the domains and projections. Both knowledge extraction and transfer processes are synchronously updated to reach the best performance. Extensive experiments on the synthetic and real-world benchmarks including outdoor and indoor scenarios demonstrate that our method achieves significantly better performance than prior SFUDA methods for pinhole-to-panoramic adaptation",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Dance serves as a powerful medium for expressing human emotions but the lifelike generation of dance is still a considerable challenge. Recently diffusion models have showcased remarkable generative abilities across various domains. They hold promise for human motion generation due to their adaptable many-to-many nature. Nonetheless current diffusion-based motion generation models often create entire motion sequences directly and unidirectionally lacking focus on the motion with local and bidirectional enhancement. When choreographing high-quality dance movements people need to take into account not only the musical context but also the nearby music-aligned dance motions. To authentically capture human behavior we propose a Bidirectional Autoregressive Diffusion Model (BADM) for music-to-dance generation where a bidirectional encoder is built to enforce that the generated dance is harmonious in both the forward and backward directions. To make the generated dance motion smoother a local information decoder is built for local motion enhancement. The proposed framework is able to generate new motions based on the input conditions and nearby motions which foresees individual motion slices iteratively and consolidates all predictions. To further refine the synchronicity between the generated dance and the beat the beat information is incorporated as an input to generate better music-aligned dance movements. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to existing unidirectional approaches on the prominent benchmark for music-to-dance generation",

    "title": "Align Before Adapt: Leveraging Entity-to-Region Alignments for Generalizable Video Action Recognition",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Large-scale visual-language pre-trained models have achieved significant success in various video tasks. However most existing methods follow an \"adapt then align\" paradigm which adapts pre-trained image encoders to model video-level representations and utilizes one-hot or text embedding of the action labels for supervision. This paradigm overlooks the challenge of mapping from static images to complicated activity concepts. In this paper we propose a novel \"Align before Adapt\" (ALT) paradigm. Prior to adapting to video representation learning we exploit the entity-to-region alignments for each frame. The alignments are fulfilled by matching the region-aware image embeddings to an offline-constructed text corpus. With the aligned entities we feed their text embeddings to a transformer-based video adapter as the queries which can help extract the semantics of the most important entities from a video to a vector. This paradigm reuses the visual-language alignment of VLP during adaptation and tries to explain an action by the underlying entities. This helps understand actions by bridging the gap with complex activity semantics particularly when facing unfamiliar or unseen categories. ALT demonstrates competitive performance while maintaining remarkably low computational costs. In fully supervised experiments it achieves 88.1% top-1 accuracy on Kinetics-400 with only 4947 GFLOPs. Moreover ALT outperforms the previous state-of-the-art methods in both zero-shot and few-shot experiments emphasizing its superior generalizability across various learning scenarios",

In this paper we introduce FRESCO intra-frame correspondence alongside inter-frame correspondence to establish a more robust spatial-temporal constraint.

Deep learning has achieved impressive success on SPI reconstruction. However previous poor reconstruction performance and impractical imaging model limit its real-world applications. In this paper we propose a deep unfolding network with hybrid-attention Transformer on Kronecker SPI model dubbed HATNet to improve the imaging quality of real SPI cameras. Specifically we unfold the computation graph of the iterative shrinkage-thresholding algorithm (ISTA) into two alternative modules: efficient tensor gradient descent and hybrid-attention multi-scale denoising. By virtue of Kronecker SPI the gradient descent module can avoid high computational overheads rooted in previous gradient descent modules based on vectorized SPI. The denoising module is an encoder-decoder architecture powered by dual-scale spatial attention for high- and low-frequency aggregation and channel attention for global information recalibration. Moreover we build a SPI prototype to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Then our weather-conditional radar-flow gating network modulates the information flow of fusion features depending on weather conditions and obtains enhanced feature that effectively incorporates the strength of two domains under various weather conditions.

Extracting reflectance maps and geometry from one image is ill-posed: recovering geometry is a one-to-many mapping problem and reflectance and light are difficult to disentangle. Accurate geometry and reflectance can be captured under the controlled conditions of a light stage but it is costly to acquire large datasets in this fashion. Moreover training solely with this type of data leads to poor generalization with in-the-wild images. This motivates the introduction of MoSAR a method for 3D avatar generation from monocular images. We propose a semi-supervised training scheme that improves generalization by learning from both light stage and in-the-wild datasets. This is achieved using a novel differentiable shading formulation. We show that our approach effectively disentangles the intrinsic face parameters producing relightable avatars.

Specifically by forcing vision- language models (VLMs) to answer questions and simultane- ously provide visual evidence we seek to ascertain the extent to which the predictions of such techniques are genuinely anchored in relevant video content versus spurious corre- lations from language or irrelevant visual context. Towards this we construct NExT-GQA - an extension of NExT-QA with 10.5K temporal grounding (or location) labels tied to the original QA pairs. With NExT-GQA we scrutinize a series of state-of-the-art VLMs. Through post-hoc atten- tion analysis we find that these models are extremely weak in substantiating the answers despite their strong QA per- formance. This exposes the limitation of current VLMs in making reliable predictions. As a remedy we further explore and propose a grounded-QA method via Gaussian mask optimization and cross-modal learning. Experiments with different backbones demonstrate that this grounding mechanism improves both grounding and QA. With these efforts we aim to push towards trustworthy VLMs in VQA systems.

DiffHuman is implemented as a conditional diffusion model that denoises pixel-aligned 2D observations of an underlying 3D shape representation.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Owe to the powerful generative priors the pre-trained text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models have become increasingly popular in solving the real-world image super-resolution problem. However as a consequence of the heavy quality degradation of input low-resolution (LR) images the destruction of local structures can lead to ambiguous image semantics. As a result the content of reproduced high-resolution image may have semantic errors deteriorating the super-resolution performance. To address this issue we present a semantics-aware approach to better preserve the semantic fidelity of generative real-world image super-resolution. First we train a degradation-aware prompt extractor which can generate accurate soft and hard semantic prompts even under strong degradation. The hard semantic prompts refer to the image tags aiming to enhance the local perception ability of the T2I model while the soft semantic prompts compensate for the hard ones to provide additional representation information. These semantic prompts encourage the T2I model to generate detailed and semantically accurate results.

Recent research has recognized these models are robust to shuffling but are limited to inter-token permutation in the forward propagation. In this work we propose our definition of permutation equivariance a broader concept covering both inter- and intra- token permutation in the forward and backward propagation of neural networks. We rigorously proved that such permutation equivariance property can be satisfied on most vanilla Transformer-based models with almost no adaptation. We examine the property over a range of state-of-the-art models including ViT Bert GPT and others with experimental validations. Further as a proof-of-concept we explore how real-world applications including privacy-enhancing split learning and model authorization could exploit the permutation equivariance property which implicates wider intriguing application scenarios.

    "abstract": "Establishing an automatic evaluation metric that closely aligns with human judgments is essential for effectively developing image captioning models. Recent data-driven metrics have demonstrated a stronger correlation with human judgments than classic metrics such as CIDEr; however they lack sufficient capabilities to handle hallucinations and generalize across diverse images and texts partially because they compute scalar similarities merely using embeddings learned from tasks unrelated to image captioning evaluation. In this study we propose Polos a supervised automatic evaluation metric for image captioning models. Polos computes scores from multimodal inputs using a parallel feature extraction mechanism that leverages embeddings trained through large-scale contrastive learning. To train Polos we introduce Multimodal Metric Learning from Human Feedback (M2LHF) a framework for developing metrics based on human feedback. We constructed the Polaris dataset which comprises 131K human judgments from 550 evaluators which is approximately ten times larger than standard datasets.

In this process the input may represent a surface with discontinuities e.g. due to self-occlusion. To reconstruct an accurate depth map from the input normal map hidden surface gradients occurring from the jumps must be handled. To model these jumps correctly we design a novel discretization for the domain of normal integration. Our key idea is to introduce auxiliary edges which bridge between piecewise-smooth planes in the domain so that the magnitude of hidden jumps can be explicitly expressed on finite elements. Using the auxiliary edges we design a novel algorithm to optimize the discontinuity and the depth map from the input normal map. Our method optimizes discontinuities by using a combination of iterative re-weighted least squares and iterative filtering of the jump magnitudes on auxiliary edges to provide strong sparsity regularization.

As the differences in observations do not alter the identities of objects the obtained association results should be consistent. Based on this rationale we generate multiple observation paths each specifying a different set of frames to be skipped and formulate the Path Consistency Loss that enforces the association results are consistent across different observation paths. We use the proposed loss to train our object matching model with only self-supervision.

This presents a fundamental trade-off between the spatial resolution of the sensor array and the SNR received at each pixel. Theoretical characterization of this fundamental limit is explored.

CDFSL faces challenges in transferring knowledge across dissimilar domains and fine-tuning models with limited training data. To address these challenges we initially extend the analysis of loss landscapes from the parameter space to the representation space which allows us to simultaneously interpret the transferring and fine-tuning difficulties of CDFSL models. We observe that sharp minima in the loss landscapes of the representation space result in representations that are hard to transfer and fine-tune. Moreover existing flatness-based methods have limited generalization ability due to their short-range flatness. To enhance the transferability and facilitate fine-tuning we introduce a simple yet effective approach to achieve long-range flattening of the minima in the loss landscape. This approach considers representations that are differently normalized as minima in the loss landscape and flattens the high-loss region in the middle by randomly sampling interpolated representations. We implement this method as a new normalization layer that replaces the original one in both CNNs and ViTs. This layer is simple and lightweight introducing only a minimal number of additional parameters. Experimental results on 8 datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of average accuracy. Moreover our method achieves performance improvements of up to 9% compared to the current best approaches on individual datasets. Our code will be released",

    "abstract": "Improving the detection of distant 3d objects is an important yet challenging task. For camera-based 3D perception the annotation of 3d bounding relies heavily on LiDAR for accurate depth information. As such the distance of annotation is often limited due to the sparsity of LiDAR points on distant objects which hampers the capability of existing detectors for long-range scenarios. We address this challenge by considering only 2D box supervision for distant objects since they are easy to annotate. We propose LR3D a framework that learns to recover the missing depth of distant objects. LR3D adopts an implicit projection head to learn the generation of mapping between 2D boxes and depth using the 3D supervision on close objects. This mapping allows the depth estimation of distant objects conditioned on their 2D boxes making long-range 3D detection with 2D supervision feasible. Experiments show that without distant 3D annotations LR3D allows camera-based methods to detect distant objects (over 200m) with comparable accuracy to full 3D supervision. Our framework is general and could widely benefit 3D detection methods to a large extent",

Ensuring both text fidelity and style realness is crucial for high-quality text image super-resolution.

In this work we propose an Image Diffusion Model (IDM) to restore text images with realistic styles. For diffusion models they are not only suitable for modeling realistic image distribution but also appropriate for learning text distribution. Since text prior is important to guarantee the correctness of the restored text structure according to existing arts we also propose a Text Diffusion Model (TDM) for text recognition which can guide IDM to generate text images with correct structures.

In particular one discriminator is utilized to enable the SR network to learn the distribution of real-world high-quality images in an adversarial training manner. However the distribution learning is overly coarse-grained which is susceptible to virtual textures and causes counter-intuitive generation results. To mitigate this we propose the simple and effective Semantic-aware Discriminator (denoted as SeD) which encourages the SR network to learn the fine-grained distributions by introducing the semantics of images as a condition. Concretely we aim to excavate the semantics of images from a well-trained semantic extractor. Under different semantics the discriminator is able to distinguish the real-fake images individually and adaptively which guides the SR network to learn the more fine-grained semantic-aware textures. To obtain accurate and abundant semantics we take full advantage of recently popular pretrained vision models (PVMs) with extensive datasets and then incorporate its semantic features into the discriminator through a well-designed spatial cross-attention module. In this way our proposed semantic-aware discriminator empowered the SR network to produce more photo-realistic and pleasing images.

Prior studies have primarily focused on probing such bias attributes individually while ignoring biases associated with intersections between social attributes. This could be due to the difficulty of collecting an exhaustive set of image-text pairs for various combinations of social attributes. To address this challenge we employ text-to-image diffusion models to produce counterfactual examples for probing intersectional social biases at scale. Our approach utilizes Stable Diffusion with cross attention control to produce sets of counterfactual image-text pairs that are highly similar in their depiction of a subject (e.g. a given occupation) while differing only in their depiction of intersectional social attributes (e.g. race & gender). Through our over-generate-then-filter methodology we produce SocialCounterfactuals a high-quality dataset containing 171k image-text pairs for probing intersectional biases related to gender race and physical characteristics. We conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate the usefulness of our generated dataset for probing and mitigating intersectional social biases in state-of-the-art VLMs",

Tailored to the SVS we present SVDTree a new hybrid tree modeling approach by combining structure-oriented branch reconstruction and self-organization-based foliage reconstruction.

We highlight important drawbacks of FID: Inception's poor representation of the rich and varied content generated by modern text-to-image models incorrect normality assumptions and poor sample complexity. We call for a reevaluation of FID's use as the primary quality metric for generated images. We empirically demonstrate that FID contradicts human raters it does not reflect gradual improvement of iterative text-to-image models it does not capture distortion levels and that it produces inconsistent results when varying the sample size. We also propose an alternative new metric CMMD based on richer CLIP embeddings and the maximum mean discrepancy distance with the Gaussian RBF kernel. It is an unbiased estimator that does not make any assumptions on the probability distribution of the embeddings and is sample efficient.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "The recent success in revealing scene details from sparse 3D point clouds obtained via structure-from-motion has raised significant privacy concerns in visual localization. One prominent approach for mitigating this issue is to lift 3D points to 3D lines thereby reducing the effectiveness of the scene inversion attacks but this comes at the cost of increased algorithmic complexity for camera localization due to weaker geometric constraints induced by line clouds. To overcome this limitation we propose a new lifting approach called \"ray cloud\" whereby each lifted 3D line intersects at one of two predefined locations depicting omnidirectional rays from two cameras. This yields two benefits i) camera localization can now be cast as relative pose estimation between the query image and the calibrated rig of two perspective cameras which can be efficiently solved using a variant of the 5-point algorithm and ii) the ray cloud introduces erroneous estimations for the density-based inversion attack degrading the quality of scene recovery. Moreover we explore possible modifications of the inversion attack to better recover scenes from the ray clouds and propose a ray sampling technique to reduce the effectiveness of the modified attack. Experimental results on two public datasets show real-time localization speed as well as enhanced privacy-preserving capability over the state-of-the-art without overly sacrificing the localization accuracy",

    "abstract": "Joint camera pose and dense geometry estimation from a set of images or a monocular video remains a challenging problem due to its computational complexity and inherent visual ambiguities. Most dense incremental reconstruction systems operate directly on image pixels and solve for their 3D positions using multi-view geometry cues. Such pixel-level approaches suffer from ambiguities or violations of multi-view consistency (e.g. caused by textureless or specular surfaces). We address this issue with a new image representation which we call a SuperPrimitive. SuperPrimitives are obtained by splitting images into semantically correlated local regions and enhancing them with estimated surface normal directions both of which are predicted by state-of-the-art single image neural networks. This provides a local geometry estimate per SuperPrimitive while their relative positions are adjusted based on multi-view observations. We demonstrate the versatility of our new representation by addressing three 3D reconstruction tasks: depth completion few-view structure from motion and monocular dense visual odometry.

This limitation arises from (i) poor sample efficiency and (ii) over-fitting to training scenarios. To address these challenges we present a world model that learns invariant features using (i) contrastive unsupervised learning and (ii) an intervention-invariant regularizer. Learning an explicit representation of the world dynamics i.e. a world model improves sample efficiency while contrastive learning implicitly enforces learning of invariant features which improves generalization. However the naive integration of contrastive loss to world models is not good enough as world-model-based RL methods independently optimize representation learning and agent policy. To overcome this issue we propose an intervention-invariant regularizer in the form of an auxiliary task such as depth prediction image denoising image segmentation etc. that explicitly enforces invariance to style interventions. Our method outperforms current state-of-the-art model-based and model-free RL methods and significantly improves on out-of-distribution point navigation tasks evaluated on the iGibson benchmark. With only visual observations we further demonstrate that our approach outperforms recent language-guided foundation models for point navigation which is essential for deployment on robots with limited computation capabilities.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "The Diffusion model a prevalent framework for image generation encounters significant challenges in terms of broad applicability due to its extended inference times and substantial memory requirements. Efficient Post-training Quantization (PTQ) is pivotal for addressing these issues in traditional models. Different from traditional models diffusion models heavily depend on the time-step t to achieve satisfactory multi-round denoising. Usually t from the finite set \\ 1 \\ldots T\\ is encoded to a temporal feature by a few modules totally irrespective of the sampling data. However existing PTQ methods do not optimize these modules separately. They adopt inappropriate reconstruction targets and complex calibration methods resulting in a severe disturbance of the temporal feature and denoising trajectory as well as a low compression efficiency. To solve these we propose a Temporal Feature Maintenance Quantization (TFMQ) framework building upon a Temporal Information Block which is just related to the time-step t and unrelated to the sampling data. Powered by the pioneering block design we devise temporal information aware reconstruction (TIAR) and finite set calibration (FSC) to align the full-precision temporal features in a limited time. Equipped with the framework we can maintain the most temporal information and ensure the end-to-end generation quality. Extensive experiments on various datasets and diffusion models prove our state-of-the-art results. Remarkably our quantization approach for the first time achieves model performance nearly on par with the full-precision model under 4-bit weight quantization. Additionally our method incurs almost no extra computational cost and accelerates quantization time by 2.0 xon LSUN-Bedrooms 256 x256 compared to previous works.

This paper asks this question: can self-supervised pre-training learn general facial representations for various facial analysis tasks? Recent efforts toward this goal are limited to treating each face image as a whole i.e. learning consistent facial representations at the image-level which overlooks the consistency of local facial representations (i.e. facial regions like eyes nose etc). In this work we make a first attempt to propose a novel self-supervised facial representation learning framework to learn consistent global and local facial representations Facial Region Awareness (FRA). Specifically we explicitly enforce the consistency of facial regions by matching the local facial representations across views which are extracted with learned heatmaps highlighting the facial regions. Inspired by the mask prediction in supervised semantic segmentation we obtain the heatmaps via cosine similarity between the per-pixel projection of feature maps and facial mask embeddings computed from learnable positional embeddings which leverage the attention mechanism to globally look up the facial image for facial regions. To learn such heatmaps we formulate the learning of facial mask embeddings as a deep clustering problem by assigning the pixel features from the feature maps to them. The transfer learning results on facial classification and regression tasks show that our FRA outperforms previous pre-trained models and more importantly using ResNet as the unified backbone for various tasks our FRA achieves comparable or even better performance compared with SOTA methods in facial analysis tasks",

Both 2D and 3D diffusion models can help generate decent 3D objects based on prompts. 3D diffusion models have good 3D consistency but their quality and generalization are limited as trainable 3D data is expensive and hard to obtain. 2D diffusion models enjoy strong abilities of generalization and fine generation but 3D consistency is hard to guarantee. This paper attempts to bridge the power from the two types of diffusion models via the recent explicit and efficient 3D Gaussian splatting representation.

Operations of noisy point growing and color perturbation are introduced to enhance the initialized Gaussians.

This approach limits the generation of segmentation masks derived from word tokens not contained in the text prompt.

In addition we propose a lightweight optimization process based on OVAM for finding tokens that generate accurate attention maps for an object class with a single annotation. We evaluate these tokens within existing state-of-the-art Stable Diffusion extensions.

Existing methods mitigate this issue with either training with specific designed data or inferencing with external knowledge from other sources incurring inevitable additional costs. In this paper we present OPERA a novel MLLM decoding method grounded in an Over-trust Penalty and a Retrospection-Allocation strategy serving as a nearly free lunch to alleviate the hallucination issue without additional data knowledge or training. Our approach begins with an interesting observation that most hallucinations are closely tied to the knowledge aggregation patterns manifested in the self-attention matrix i.e. MLLMs tend to generate new tokens by focusing on a few summary tokens but not all the previous tokens. Such partial over-trust inclination results in the neglecting of image tokens and describes the image content with hallucination. Based on the observation OPERA introduces a penalty term on the model logits during the beam-search decoding to mitigate the over-trust issue along with a rollback strategy that retrospects the presence of summary tokens in the previously generated tokens and re-allocate the token selection if necessary. With extensive experiments OPERA shows significant hallucination-mitigating performance on different MLLMs and metrics proving its effectiveness and generality.

Through coarse-to-fine feature extraction and multi-task learning for VER our agent predicts 3D occupancy 3D room layout and 3D bounding boxes jointly. Based on online collected VERs our agent performs volume state estimation and builds episodic memory for predicting the next step.

Specifically DreamComposer first uses a view-aware 3D lifting module to obtain 3D representations of an object from multiple views. Then it renders the latent features of the target view from 3D representations with the multi-view feature fusion module. Finally the target view features extracted from multi-view inputs are injected into a pre-trained diffusion model. Experiments show that DreamComposer is compatible with state-of-the-art diffusion models for zero-shot novel view synthesis further enhancing them to generate high-fidelity novel view images with multi-view conditions ready for controllable 3D object reconstruction and various other applications",

    "abstract": "Model calibration measuring the alignment between the prediction accuracy and model confidence is an important metric reflecting model trustworthiness. Existing dense binary classification methods without proper regularisation of model confidence are prone to being over-confident. To calibrate Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) we propose a Self-Calibrating Vicinal Risk Minimisation (SCVRM) that explores the vicinity space of labeled data where vicinal images that are farther away from labeled images adopt the groundtruth label with decreasing label confidence. We prove that in the logistic regression problem SCVRM can be seen as a Vicinal Risk Minimisation plus a regularisation term that penalises the over-confident predictions. In practical implementation SCVRM is approximated using Monte Carlo sampling that samples additional augmented training images and labels from the vicinal distributions. Experimental results demonstrate that SCVRM can significantly enhance model calibration for different dense classification tasks on both in-distribution and out-of-distribution data.

One challenge of multimodal fusion is that the unimodal data in their unique embedding space mostly contains potential noise which leads to corrupted cross-modal interactions. However in this paper we show that the potential noise in unimodal data could be well quantified and further employed to enhance more stable unimodal embeddings via contrastive learning. Specifically we propose a novel generic and robust multimodal fusion strategy termed Embracing Aleatoric Uncertainty (EAU) which is simple and can be applied to kinds of modalities. It consists of two key steps: (1) the Stable Unimodal Feature Augmentation (SUFA) that learns a stable unimodal representation by incorporating the aleatoric uncertainty into self-supervised contrastive learning. (2) Robust Multimodal Feature Integration (RMFI) leveraging an information-theoretic strategy to learn a robust compact joint representation. We evaluate our proposed EAU method on five multimodal datasets where the video RGB image text audio and depth image are involved. Extensive experiments demonstrate the EAU method is more noise-resistant than existing multimodal fusion strategies and establishes new state-of-the-art on several benchmarks",

Despite the demonstrated success these trackers may easily drift towards distractors with similar appearance due to the single forward evaluation scheme lacking self-correction. To address this issue we cast visual tracking as a point set based denoising diffusion process and propose a novel generative learning based tracker dubbed DiffusionTrack. Our DiffusionTrack possesses two appealing properties: 1) It follows a novel noise-to-target tracking paradigm that leverages multiple denoising diffusion steps to localize the target in a dynamic searching manner per frame. 2) It models the diffusion process using a point set representation which can better handle appearance variations for more precise localization. One side benefit is that DiffusionTrack greatly simplifies the post-processing e.g. removing window penalty scheme. Without bells and whistles our DiffusionTrack achieves leading performance over the state-of-the-art trackers and runs in real-time. The code is in https://github.com/VISION-SJTU/DiffusionTrack",

Our expression control is so sophisticated that it can be specialized by the fine-grained emotional vocabulary.

To overcome this we propose several innovative designs in the conditional diffusion model including balancing identity and expression encoder improved midpoint sampling and explicitly background conditioning.

    "abstract": "Computer vision techniques play a central role in the perception stack of autonomous vehicles. Such methods are employed to perceive the vehicle surroundings given sensor data. 3D LiDAR sensors are commonly used to collect sparse 3D point clouds from the scene. However compared to human perception such systems struggle to deduce the unseen parts of the scene given those sparse point clouds. In this matter the scene completion task aims at predicting the gaps in the LiDAR measurements to achieve a more complete scene representation. Given the promising results of recent diffusion models as generative models for images we propose extending them to achieve scene completion from a single 3D LiDAR scan. Previous works used diffusion models over range images extracted from LiDAR data directly applying image-based diffusion methods. Distinctly we propose to directly operate on the points reformulating the noising and denoising diffusion process such that it can efficiently work at scene scale. Together with our approach we propose a regularization loss to stabilize the noise predicted during the denoising process. Our experimental evaluation shows that our method can complete the scene given a single LiDAR scan as input producing a scene with more details compared to state-of-the-art scene completion methods.

In contrast to image-based methods that measure the quality of downscaled images ours is process-based that draws ideas from rate-distortion theory to measure the distortion incurred during downscaling. Our main idea is that downscaling and super-resolution (SR) can be viewed as the encoding and decoding processes in the rate-distortion model respectively and that a downscaling algorithm that preserves more details in the resulting low-resolution (LR) images should lead to less distorted high-resolution (HR) images in SR. In other words the distortion should increase as the downscaling algorithm deteriorates. However it is non-trivial to measure this distortion as it requires the SR algorithm to be blind and stochastic. Our key insight is that such requirements can be met by recent SR algorithms based on deep generative models that can find all matching HR images for a given LR image on their learned image manifolds.

We introduce two novel types of backdoor attacks on TIOD each offering unique capabilities: Object-affecting Attack and Range-affecting Attack. We conduct a comprehensive analysis of key factors influencing trigger design which include temperature size material and concealment. These factors especially temperature significantly impact the efficacy of backdoor attacks on TIOD. A thorough understanding of these factors will serve as a foundation for designing physical triggers and temperature controlling experiments. Our study includes extensive experiments conducted in both digital and physical environments. In the digital realm we evaluate our approach using benchmark datasets for TIOD achieving an Attack Success Rate (ASR) of up to 98.21%.

Conventional CIR approaches need a training dataset composed of triplets of query image query text and target image which is very expensive to collect. Several recent works have worked on the zero-shot (ZS) CIR paradigm to tackle the issue without using pre-collected triplets. However the existing ZS-CIR methods show limited backbone scalability and generalizability due to the lack of diversity of the input texts during training. We propose a novel CIR framework only using language for its training. Our LinCIR (Language-only training for CIR) can be trained only with text datasets by a novel self-supervision named self-masking projection (SMP). We project the text latent embedding to the token embedding space and construct a new text by replacing the keyword tokens of the original text. Then we let the new and original texts have the same latent embedding vector. With this simple strategy LinCIR is surprisingly efficient and highly effective; LinCIR with CLIP ViT-G backbone is trained in 48 minutes and shows the best ZS-CIR performances on four different CIR benchmarks CIRCO GeneCIS FashionIQ and CIRR even outperforming supervised method on FashionIQ.

Our dataset can complement existing datasets on various facial-related tasks such as facial synthesis with 2D/3D-aware GAN diffusion-based text-to-image face generation and face reenactment. Specifically training with EFHQ helps models generalize well across diverse poses significantly improving performance in scenarios involving extreme views confirmed by extensive experiments. Additionally we utilize EFHQ to define a challenging cross-view face verification benchmark in which the performance of SOTA face recognition models drops 5-37% compared to frontal-to-frontal scenarios aiming to stimulate studies on face recognition under severe pose conditions in the wild",

    "abstract": "Point Cloud Registration is a critical and challenging task in computer vision. Recent advancements have predominantly embraced a coarse-to-fine matching mechanism with the key to matching the superpoints located in patches with inter-frame consistent structures. However previous methods still face challenges with ambiguous matching because the interference information aggregated from irrelevant regions may disturb the capture of inter-frame consistency relations leading to wrong matches. To address this issue we propose Dynamic Cues-Assisted Transformer (DCATr). Firstly the interference from irrelevant regions is greatly reduced by constraining attention to certain cues i.e. regions with highly correlated structures of potential corresponding superpoints. Secondly cues-assisted attention is designed to mine the inter-frame consistency relations while more attention is assigned to pairs with high consistent confidence in feature aggregation. Finally a dynamic updating fashion is proposed to facilitate mining richer consistency information further improving aggregated features' distinctiveness and relieving matching ambiguity. Extensive evaluations on indoor and outdoor standard benchmarks demonstrate that DCATr outperforms all state-of-the-art methods",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Diffusion MRI (dMRI) non-invasively maps brain white matter yet necessitates denoising due to low signal-to-noise ratios. Patch2Self (P2S) employing self-supervised techniques and regression on a Casorati matrix effectively denoises dMRI images and has become the new de-facto standard in this field. P2S however is resource intensive both in terms of running time and memory usage as it uses all voxels (n) from all-but-one held-in volumes (d-1) to learn a linear mapping Phi : \\mathbb R ^ n x(d-1) \\mapsto \\mathbb R ^ n for denoising the held-out volume. The increasing size and dimensionality of higher resolution dMRI acquisitions can make P2S infeasible for large-scale analyses. This work exploits the redundancy imposed by P2S to alleviate its performance issues and inspect regions that influence the noise disproportionately. Specifically this study makes a three-fold contribution: (1) We present Patch2Self2 (P2S2) a method that uses matrix sketching to perform self-supervised denoising. By solving a sub-problem on a smaller sub-space so called coreset we show how P2S2 can yield a significant speedup in training time while using less memory. (2) We present a theoretical analysis of P2S2 focusing on determining the optimal sketch size through rank estimation a key step in achieving a balance between denoising accuracy and computational efficiency. (3) We show how the so-called statistical leverage scores can be used to interpret the denoising of dMRI data a process that was traditionally treated as a black-box. Experimental results on both simulated and real data affirm that P2S2 maintains denoising quality while significantly enhancing speed and memory efficiency achieved by training on a reduced data subset",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Current subject-driven image generation methods encounter significant challenges in person-centric image generation. The reason is that they learn the semantic scene and person generation by fine-tuning a common pre-trained diffusion which involves an irreconcilable training imbalance. Precisely to generate realistic persons they need to sufficiently tune the pre-trained model which inevitably causes the model to forget the rich semantic scene prior and makes scene generation over-fit to the training data. Moreover even with sufficient fine-tuning these methods can still not generate high-fidelity persons since joint learning of the scene and person generation also lead to quality compromise. In this paper we propose Face-diffuser an effective collaborative generation pipeline to eliminate the above training imbalance and quality compromise. Specifically we first develop two specialized pre-trained diffusion models i.e. Text-driven Diffusion Model (TDM) and Subject-augmented Diffusion Model (SDM) for scene and person generation respectively. The sampling process is divided into three sequential stages i.e. semantic scene construction subject-scene fusion and subject enhancement. The first and last stages are performed by TDM and SDM respectively. The subject-scene fusion stage that is the collaboration achieved through a novel and highly effective mechanism Saliency-adaptive Noise Fusion (SNF). Specifically it is based on our key observation that there exists a robust link between classifier-free guidance responses and the saliency of generated images. In each time step SNF leverages the unique strengths of each model and allows for the spatial blending of predicted noises from both models automatically in a saliency-aware manner all of which can be seamlessly integrated into the DDIM sampling process. Extensive experiments confirm the impressive effectiveness and robustness of the Face-diffuser in generating high-fidelity person images depicting multiple unseen persons with varying contexts.

Most of existing methods need to infer pseudo segmentation for training by serial alignment between all frames and the transcript which is time-consuming and hard to be parallelized while training. In this work we aim to escape from this inefficient alignment with massive but redundant frames and instead to directly localize a few action transitions for pseudo segmentation generation where a transition refers to the change from an action segment to its next adjacent one in the transcript. As the true transitions are submerged in noisy boundaries due to intra-segment visual variation we propose a novel Action-Transition-Aware Boundary Alignment (ATBA) framework to efficiently and effectively filter out noisy boundaries and detect transitions. In addition to boost the semantic learning in the case that noise is inevitably present in the pseudo segmentation we also introduce video-level losses to utilize the trusted video-level supervision.

In-Context Learning (ICL) explores training-free few-shot learning where models are encouraged to \"learn to learn\" from limited tasks and generalize to unseen tasks. In this work we propose link-context learning (LCL) which emphasizes \"reasoning from cause and effect\" to augment the learning capabilities of MLLMs. LCL goes beyond traditional ICL by explicitly strengthening the causal relationship between the support set and the query set. By providing demonstrations with causal links LCL guides the model to discern not only the analogy but also the underlying causal associations between data points which empowers MLLMs to recognize unseen images and understand novel concepts more effectively. To facilitate the evaluation of this novel approach we introduce the ISEKAI dataset comprising exclusively of unseen generated image-label pairs designed for link-context learning.

Essentially the 3D hand pose estimation can be regarded as a 3D point subset generative problem conditioned on input frames. Thanks to the recent significant progress on diffusion-based generative models hand pose estimation can also benefit from the diffusion model to estimate keypoint locations with high quality. However directly deploying the existing diffusion models to solve hand pose estimation is non-trivial since they cannot achieve the complex permutation mapping and precise localization. Based on this motivation this paper proposes HandDiff a diffusion-based hand pose estimation model that iteratively denoises accurate hand pose conditioned on hand-shaped image-point clouds. In order to recover keypoint permutation and accurate location we further introduce joint-wise condition and local detail condition.

Many few-shot object detection (FSOD) methods have been proposed to tackle this issue by adopting image-level augmentations in linear manners. Nevertheless those handcrafted enhancements often suffer from limited diversity and lack of semantic awareness resulting in unsatisfactory performance. To this end we propose a Semantic-guided Non-linear Instance-level Data Augmentation method (SNIDA) for FSOD by decoupling the foreground and background to increase their diversities respectively. We design a semantic awareness enhancement strategy to separate objects from backgrounds. Concretely masks of instances are extracted by an unsupervised semantic segmentation module. Then the diversity of samples would be improved by fusing instances into different backgrounds. Considering the shortcomings of augmenting images in a limited transformation space of existing traditional data augmentation methods we introduce an object reconstruction enhancement module. The aim of this module is to generate sufficient diversity and non-linear training data at the instance level through a semantic-guided masked autoencoder. In this way the potential of data can be fully exploited in various object detection scenarios.

We find that in general LMMs are not robust to visual adversarial inputs. However our findings suggest that context provided to the model via prompts--such as questions in a QA pair--helps to mitigate the effects of visual adversarial inputs. Notably the LMMs evaluated demonstrated remarkable resilience to such attacks on the ScienceQA task with only an 8.10% drop in performance compared to their visual counterparts which dropped 99.73%.

Unfortunately existing methods usually formulate this task as a voxel-wise classification problem and treat each voxel equally in 3D space during training. As the hard voxels have not been paid enough attention the performance in some challenging regions is limited. The 3D dense space typically contains a large number of empty voxels which are easy to learn but require amounts of computation due to handling all the voxels uniformly for the existing models. Furthermore the voxels in the boundary region are more challenging to differentiate than those in the interior. In this paper we propose HASSC approach to train the semantic scene completion model with hardness-aware design. The global hardness from the network optimization process is defined for dynamical hard voxel selection. Then the local hardness with geometric anisotropy is adopted for voxel-wise refinement. Besides self-distillation strategy is introduced to make training process stable and consistent.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Recent innovations on text-to-3D generation have featured Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) which enables the zero-shot learning of implicit 3D models (NeRF) by directly distilling prior knowledge from 2D diffusion models. However current SDS-based models still struggle with intricate text prompts and commonly result in distorted 3D models with unrealistic textures or cross-view inconsistency issues. In this work we introduce a novel Visual Prompt-guided text-to-3D diffusion model (VP3D) that explicitly unleashes the visual appearance knowledge in 2D visual prompt to boost text-to-3D generation. Instead of solely supervising SDS with text prompt VP3D first capitalizes on 2D diffusion model to generate a high-quality image from input text which subsequently acts as visual prompt to strengthen SDS optimization with explicit visual appearance. Meanwhile we couple the SDS optimization with additional differentiable reward function that encourages rendering images of 3D models to better visually align with 2D visual prompt and semantically match with text prompt. Through extensive experiments we show that the 2D Visual Prompt in our VP3D significantly eases the learning of visual appearance of 3D models and thus leads to higher visual fidelity with more detailed textures. It is also appealing in view that when replacing the self-generating visual prompt with a given reference image VP3D is able to trigger a new task of stylized text-to-3D generation.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Undoubtedly high-fidelity 3D hair is crucial for achieving realism artistic expression and immersion in computer graphics. While existing 3D hair modeling methods have achieved impressive performance the challenge of achieving high-quality hair reconstruction persists: they either require strict capture conditions making practical applications difficult or heavily rely on learned prior data obscuring fine-grained details in images. To address these challenges we propose MonoHair a generic framework to achieve high-fidelity hair reconstruction from a monocular video without specific requirements for environments. Our approach bifurcates the hair modeling process into two main stages: precise exterior reconstruction and interior structure inference. The exterior is meticulously crafted using our Patch-based Multi-View Optimization PMVO. This method strategically collects and integrates hair information from multiple views independent of prior data to produce a high-fidelity exterior 3D line map. This map not only captures intricate details but also facilitates the inference of the hair's inner structure. For the interior we employ a data-driven multi-view 3D hair reconstruction method. This method utilizes 2D structural renderings derived from the reconstructed exterior mirroring the synthetic 2D inputs used during training. This alignment effectively bridges the domain gap between our training data and real-world data thereby enhancing the accuracy and reliability of our interior structure inference. Lastly we generate a strand model and resolve the directional ambiguity by our hair growth algorithm. Our experiments demonstrate that our method exhibits robustness across diverse hairstyles and achieves state-of-the-art performance.

    "title": "Content-Style Decoupling for Unsupervised Makeup Transfer without Generating Pseudo Ground Truth",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "The absence of real targets to guide the model training is one of the main problems with the makeup transfer task. Most existing methods tackle this problem by synthesizing pseudo ground truths (PGTs). However the generated PGTs are often sub-optimal and their imprecision will eventually lead to performance degradation. To alleviate this issue in this paper we propose a novel Content-Style Decoupled Makeup Transfer (CSD-MT) method which works in a purely unsupervised manner and thus eliminates the negative effects of generating PGTs. Specifically based on the frequency characteristics analysis we assume that the low-frequency (LF) component of a face image is more associated with its makeup style information while the high-frequency (HF) component is more related to its content details. This assumption allows CSD-MT to decouple the content and makeup style information in each face image through the frequency decomposition. After that CSD-MT realizes makeup transfer by maximizing the consistency of these two types of information between the transferred result and input images respectively. Two newly designed loss functions are also introduced to further improve the transfer performance. Extensive quantitative and qualitative analyses show the effectiveness of our CSD-MT method.

    "abstract": "Large pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) like CLIP despite having remarkable generalization ability are highly vulnerable to adversarial examples. This work studies the adversarial robustness of VLMs from the novel perspective of the text prompt instead of the extensively studied model weights (frozen in this work). We first show that the effectiveness of both adversarial attack and defense are sensitive to the used text prompt. Inspired by this we propose a method to improve resilience to adversarial attacks by learning a robust text prompt for VLMs. The proposed method named Adversarial Prompt Tuning (APT) is effective while being both computationally and data efficient. Extensive experiments are conducted across 15 datasets and 4 data sparsity schemes (from 1-shot to full training data settings) to show APT's superiority over hand-engineered prompts and other state-of-the-art adaption methods. APT demonstrated excellent abilities in terms of the in-distribution performance and the generalization under input distribution shift and across datasets. Surprisingly by simply adding one learned word to the prompts APT can significantly boost the accuracy and robustness (epsilon=4/255) over the hand-engineered prompts by +13% and +8.5% on average respectively. The improvement further increases in our most effective setting to +26.4% for accuracy and +16.7% for robustness. Code is available at https://github.com/TreeLLi/APT",

This issue necessitates an initial performance enhancement within the present domain without labels while concurrently averting an excessive bias toward the current domain. Such bias exacerbates catastrophic forgetting and diminishes the generalization ability to future domains. To tackle the problem this paper designs a versatile framework to capture high-quality supervision signals from three aspects: 1) The adaptive thresholds are employed to determine the reliability of pseudo-labels; 2) The knowledge from the source pre-trained model is utilized to adjust the unreliable one and 3) By evaluating past supervision signals we calculate a diversity score to ensure subsequent generalization. In this way we form a complete supervisory signal generation framework which can capture the current domain discriminative and reserve generalization in future domains. Finally to avoid catastrophic forgetting we design a weighted soft parameter alignment method to explore the knowledge from the source model.

    "abstract": "The advent of Vision Transformers (ViTs) marks a substantial paradigm shift in the realm of computer vision. ViTs capture the global information of images through self-attention modules which perform dot product computations among patchified image tokens. While self-attention modules empower ViTs to capture long-range dependencies the computational complexity grows quadratically with the number of tokens which is a major hindrance to the practical application of ViTs. Moreover the self-attention mechanism in deep ViTs is also susceptible to the attention saturation issue. Accordingly we argue against the necessity of computing the attention scores in every layer and we propose the Less-Attention Vision Transformer (LaViT) which computes only a few attention operations at each stage and calculates the subsequent feature alignments in other layers via attention transformations that leverage the previously calculated attention scores. This novel approach can mitigate two primary issues plaguing traditional self-attention modules: the heavy computational burden and attention saturation. Our proposed architecture offers superior efficiency and ease of implementation merely requiring matrix multiplications that are highly optimized in contemporary deep learning frameworks.

This underscores the critical need for dataset pruning as the quality of these datasets is strongly correlated with the performance of VLMs on downstream tasks. Using CLIPScore from a pretrained model to only train models using highly-aligned samples is one of the most successful methods for pruning. We argue that this approach suffers from multiple limitations including: false positives and negatives due to CLIP's pretraining on noisy labels. We propose a pruning signal Sieve that employs synthetic captions generated by image-captioning models pretrained on small diverse and well-aligned image-text pairs to evaluate the alignment of noisy image-text pairs. To bridge the gap between the limited diversity of generated captions and the high diversity of alternative text (alt-text) we estimate the semantic textual similarity in the embedding space of a language model pretrained on unlabeled text corpus. Using DataComp a multimodal dataset filtering benchmark when evaluating on 38 downstream tasks our pruning approach surpasses CLIPScore by 2.6% and 1.7% on medium and large scale respectively. In addition on retrieval tasks Sieve leads to a significant improvement of 2.7% and 4.5% on medium and large scale respectively",

Yet these models have not been systematically evaluated on data captured by BLV users. We address this by empirically assessing CLIP a widely-used LMM likely to underpin many assistive technologies. Testing 25 CLIP variants in a zero-shot classification task we find that their accuracy is 15 percentage points lower on average for images captured by BLV users than web-crawled images. This disparity stems from CLIP's sensitivities to 1) image content (e.g. not recognizing disability objects as well as other objects); 2) image quality (e.g. not being robust to lighting variation); and 3) text content (e.g. not recognizing objects described by tactile adjectives as well as visual ones). We delve deeper with a textual analysis of three common pre-training datasets: LAION-400M LAION-2B and DataComp-1B showing that disability content is rarely mentioned. We then provide three examples that illustrate how the performance disparities extend to three downstream models underpinned by CLIP: OWL-ViT CLIPSeg and DALL-E2.

We then improve the prediction disagreement to extend the applicability of AETTA under adaptation failures. Our extensive evaluation with four baselines and six TTA methods demonstrates that AETTA shows an average of 19.8%p more accurate estimation compared with the baselines.

There exist methods to adapt 3D-ODs to these domains; however these methods treat 3D-ODs as a black box neglecting underlying architectural decisions and source-domain training strategies. Instead we dive deep into the details of 3D-ODs focusing our efforts on fundamental factors that influence robustness prior to domain adaptation. We systematically investigate four design choices (and the interplay between them) often overlooked in 3D-OD robustness and domain adaptation: architecture voxel encoding data augmentations and anchor strategies. We assess their impact on the robustness of nine state-of-the-art 3D-ODs across six benchmarks encompassing three types of domain gaps - sensor type weather and location. Our main findings are: (1) transformer backbones with local point features are more robust than 3D CNNs (2) test-time anchor size adjustment is crucial for adaptation across geographical locations significantly boosting scores without retraining (3) source-domain augmentations allow the model to generalize to low-resolution sensors and (4) surprisingly robustness to bad weather is improved when training directly on more clean weather data than on training with bad weather data.

We then self-train the model on these pseudo semantic labels yielding substantial performance gains over specialized methods tailored to each task: a +2.6 APbox boost (vs. CutLER) in unsupervised instance segmentation on COCO and a +7.0 PixelAcc increase (vs. STEGO) in unsupervised semantic segmentation on COCOStuff. Moreover our method sets up a new baseline for unsupervised panoptic segmentation which has not been previously explored. U2Seg is also a strong pretrained model for few-shot segmentation surpassing CutLER by +5.0 APmask when trained on a low-data regime e.g. only 1% COCO labels. We hope our simple yet effective method can inspire more research on unsupervised universal image segmentation",

    "abstract": "Few-shot segmentation remains challenging due to the limitations of its labeling information for unseen classes. Most previous approaches rely on extracting high-level feature maps from the frozen visual encoder to compute the pixel-wise similarity as a key prior guidance for the decoder. However such a prior representation suffers from coarse granularity and poor generalization to new classes since these high-level feature maps have obvious category bias. In this work we propose to replace the visual prior representation with the visual-text alignment capacity to capture more reliable guidance and enhance the model generalization. Specifically we design two kinds of training-free prior information generation strategy that attempts to utilize the semantic alignment capability of the Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training model (CLIP) to locate the target class. Besides to acquire more accurate prior guidance we build a high-order relationship of attention maps and utilize it to refine the initial prior information. Experiments on both the PASCAL-5i and COCO-20i datasets show that our method obtains a clearly substantial improvement and reaches the new state-of-the-art performance.

    "title": "SingularTrajectory: Universal Trajectory Predictor Using Diffusion Model",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "There are five types of trajectory prediction tasks: deterministic stochastic domain adaptation momentary observation and few-shot. These associated tasks are defined by various factors such as the length of input paths data split and pre-processing methods. Interestingly even though they commonly take sequential coordinates of observations as input and infer future paths in the same coordinates as output designing specialized architectures for each task is still necessary. For the other task generality issues can lead to sub-optimal performances. In this paper we propose SingularTrajectory a diffusion-based universal trajectory prediction framework to reduce the performance gap across the five tasks. The core of SingularTrajectory is to unify a variety of human dynamics representations on the associated tasks. To do this we first build a Singular space to project all types of motion patterns from each task into one embedding space. We next propose an adaptive anchor working in the Singular space. Unlike traditional fixed anchor methods that sometimes yield unacceptable paths our adaptive anchor enables correct anchors which are put into a wrong location based on a traversability map. Finally we adopt a diffusion-based predictor to further enhance the prototype paths using a cascaded denoising process. Our unified framework ensures the generality across various benchmark settings such as input modality and trajectory lengths. Extensive experiments on five public benchmarks demonstrate that SingularTrajectory substantially outperforms existing models highlighting its effectiveness in estimating general dynamics of human movements.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "In this paper we explore a novel challenging generation task i.e. Handwritten Mathematical Expression Generation (HMEG) from symbolic sequences. Since symbolic sequences are naturally graph-structured data we formulate HMEG as a graph-to-image (G2I) generation problem. Unlike the generation of natural images HMEG requires critic layout clarity for synthesizing correct and recognizable formulas but has no real masks available to supervise the learning process. To alleviate this challenge we propose a novel end-to-end G2I generation pipeline (i.e. graph - layout - mask - image) which requires no real masks or nondifferentiable alignment between layouts and masks. Technically to boost the capacity of predicting detailed relations among adjacent symbols we propose a Less-is-More (LiM) learning strategy. In addition we design a differentiable layout refinement module which maps bounding boxes to pixel-level soft masks so as to further alleviate ambiguous layout areas. Our whole model including layout prediction mask refinement and image generation can be jointly optimized in an end-to-end manner. Experimental results show that our model can generate high-quality HME images and outperforms previous generative methods. Besides a series of ablations study demonstrate effectiveness of the proposed techniques. Finally we validate that our generated images promisingly boosts the performance of HME recognition models through data augmentation.

In particular we make two interesting and surprising empirical observations. First to outperform a simple Linear Probing baseline these methods require to optimize their hyper-parameters on each target task. And second they typically underperform --sometimes dramatically-- standard zero-shot predictions in the presence of distributional drifts. Motivated by the unrealistic assumptions made in the existing literature i.e. access to a large validation set and case-specific grid-search for optimal hyperparameters we propose a novel approach that meets the requirements of real-world scenarios. More concretely we introduce a CLass-Adaptive linear Probe (CLAP) objective whose balancing term is optimized via an adaptation of the general Augmented Lagrangian method tailored to this context. We comprehensively evaluate CLAP on a broad span of datasets and scenarios demonstrating that it consistently outperforms SoTA approaches while yet being a much more efficient alternative",

In this work we present Relightable Gaussian Codec Avatars a method to build high-fidelity relightable head avatars that can be animated to generate novel expressions.

We further improve the fidelity of eye reflections and enable explicit gaze control by introducing relightable explicit eye models.

    "abstract": "In this paper we explore the capability of an agent to construct a logical sequence of action steps thereby assembling a strategic procedural plan. This plan is crucial for navigating from an initial visual observation to a target visual outcome as depicted in real-life instructional videos. Existing works have attained partial success by extensively leveraging various sources of information available in the datasets such as heavy intermediate visual observations procedural names or natural language step-by-step instructions for features or supervision signals. However the task remains formidable due to the implicit causal constraints in the sequencing of steps and the variability inherent in multiple feasible plans. To tackle these intricacies that previous efforts have overlooked we propose to enhance the agent's capabilities by infusing it with procedural knowledge. This knowledge sourced from training procedure plans and structured as a directed weighted graph equips the agent to better navigate the complexities of step sequencing and its potential variations. We coin our approach KEPP a novel Knowledge-Enhanced Procedure Planning system which harnesses a probabilistic procedural knowledge graph extracted from training data effectively acting as a comprehensive textbook for the training domain. Experimental evaluations across three widely-used datasets under settings of varying complexity reveal that KEPP attains superior state-of-the-art results while requiring only minimal supervision.

    "abstract": "It is challenging for Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) in the few-shot setting to reconstruct high-quality novel views and depth maps in 360^\\circ outward-facing indoor scenes. The captured sparse views for these scenes usually contain large viewpoint variations. This greatly reduces the potential consistency between views leading NeRFs to degrade a lot in these scenarios. Existing methods usually leverage pretrained depth prediction models to improve NeRFs. However these methods cannot guarantee geometry consistency due to the inherent geometry ambiguity in the pretrained models thus limiting NeRFs' performance. In this work we present P\\textsuperscript 2 NeRF to capture global and hierarchical geometry consistency priors from pretrained models thus facilitating few-shot NeRFs in 360^\\circ outward-facing indoor scenes. On the one hand we propose a matching-based geometry warm-up strategy to provide global geometry consistency priors for NeRFs. This effectively avoids the overfitting of early training with sparse inputs. On the other hand we propose a group depth ranking loss and ray weight mask regularization based on the monocular depth estimation model. This provides hierarchical geometry consistency priors for NeRFs. As a result our approach can fully leverage the geometry consistency priors from pretrained models and help few-shot NeRFs achieve state-of-the-art performance on two challenging indoor datasets.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Knowledge distillation (KD) has been applied to various tasks successfully and mainstream methods typically boost the student model via spatial imitation losses. However the consecutive downsamplings induced in the spatial domain of teacher model is a type of corruption hindering the student from analyzing what specific information needs to be imitated which results in accuracy degradation. To better understand the underlying pattern of corrupted feature maps we shift our attention to the frequency domain. During frequency distillation we encounter a new challenge: the low-frequency bands convey general but minimal context while the high are more informative but also introduce noise. Not each pixel within the frequency bands contributes equally to the performance. To address the above problem: (1) We propose the Frequency Prompt plugged into the teacher model absorbing the semantic frequency context during finetuning. (2) During the distillation period a pixel-wise frequency mask is generated via Frequency Prompt to localize those pixel of interests (PoIs) in various frequency bands. Additionally we employ a position-aware relational frequency loss for dense prediction tasks delivering a high-order spatial enhancement to the student model. We dub our Frequency Knowledge Distillation method as FreeKD which determines the optimal localization and extent for the frequency distillation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FreeKD not only outperforms spatial-based distillation methods consistently on dense prediction tasks (e.g. FreeKD brings 3.8 AP gains for RepPoints-R50 on COCO2017 and 4.55 mIoU gains for PSPNet-R18 on Cityscapes) but also conveys more robustness to the student. Notably we also validate the generalization of our approach on large-scale vision models (e.g. DINO and SAM)",

While significant efforts have been made towards anticipating future actions prior approaches do not take into account the aspect of plausibility in an action sequence. To address this limitation we explore the generative capability of a large video-language model in our work and further develop the understanding of plausibility in an action sequence by introducing two objective functions a counterfactual-based plausible action sequence learning loss and a long-horizon action repetition loss. We utilize temporal logical constraints as well as verb-noun action pair logical constraints to create implausible/counterfactual action sequences and use them to train the model with plausible action sequence learning loss. This loss helps the model to differentiate between plausible and not plausible action sequences and also helps the model to learn implicit temporal cues crucial for the task of action anticipation. The long-horizon action repetition loss puts a higher penalty on the actions that are more prone to repetition over a longer temporal window. With this penalization the model is able to generate diverse plausible action sequences.

As is typical for image retrieval problems a feature extractor maps the query and reference images to a feature space where a nearest neighbor search is then performed. However till recently little attention has been given to quantifying the confidence that a retrieved reference image is a correct match. Highly certain but incorrect retrieval can lead to catastrophic failure of VPR-based localization pipelines. This work compares for the first time the main approaches for estimating the image-matching uncertainty including the traditional retrieval-based uncertainty estimation more recent data-driven aleatoric uncertainty estimation and the compute-intensive geometric verification. We further formulate a simple baseline method \"SUE\" which unlike the other methods considers the freely-available poses of the reference images in the map. Our experiments reveal that a simple L2-distance between the query and reference descriptors is already a better estimate of image-matching uncertainty than current data-driven approaches. SUE outperforms the other efficient uncertainty estimation methods and its uncertainty estimates complement the computationally expensive geometric verification approach.

    "abstract": "Referring Image Segmentation (RIS) is a challenging task that requires an algorithm to segment objects referred by free-form language expressions. Despite significant progress in recent years most state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods still suffer from considerable language-image modality gap at the pixel and word level. These methods generally 1) rely on sentence-level language features for language-image alignment and 2) lack explicit training supervision for fine-grained visual grounding. Consequently they exhibit weak object-level correspondence between visual and language features. Without well-grounded features prior methods struggle to understand complex expressions that require strong reasoning over relationships among multiple objects especially when dealing with rarely used or ambiguous clauses. To tackle this challenge we introduce a novel Mask Grounding auxiliary task that significantly improves visual grounding within language features by explicitly teaching the model to learn fine-grained correspondence between masked textual tokens and their matching visual objects. Mask Grounding can be directly used on prior RIS methods and consistently bring improvements. Furthermore to holistically address the modality gap we also design a cross-modal alignment loss and an accompanying alignment module. These additions work synergistically with Mask Grounding. With all these techniques our comprehensive approach culminates in MagNet (Mask-grounded Network) an architecture that significantly outperforms prior arts on three key benchmarks (RefCOCO RefCOCO+ and G-Ref) demonstrating our method's effectiveness in addressing current limitations of RIS algorithms.

    "abstract": "The pursuit of accurate 3D hand pose estimation stands as a keystone for understanding human activity in the realm of egocentric vision. The majority of existing estimation methods still rely on single-view images as input leading to potential limitations e.g. limited field-of-view and ambiguity in depth. To address these problems adding another camera to better capture the shape of hands is a practical direction. However existing multi-view hand pose estimation methods suffer from two main drawbacks: 1) Requiring multi-view annotations for training which are expensive. 2) During testing the model becomes inapplicable if camera parameters/layout are not the same as those used in training. In this paper we propose a novel Single-to-Dual-view adaptation (S2DHand) solution that adapts a pre-trained single-view estimator to dual views. Compared with existing multi-view training methods 1) our adaptation process is unsupervised eliminating the need for multi-view annotation. 2) Moreover our method can handle arbitrary dual-view pairs with unknown camera parameters making the model applicable to diverse camera settings. Specifically S2DHand is built on certain stereo constraints including pair-wise cross-view consensus and invariance of transformation between both views. These two stereo constraints are used in a complementary manner to generate pseudo-labels allowing reliable adaptation. Evaluation results reveal that S2DHand achieves significant improvements on arbitrary camera pairs under both in-dataset and cross-dataset settings and outperforms existing adaptation methods with leading performance.

Nonidealities of EVS such as pixel or readout latency can significantly influence the quality of the enhanced images and warrant dedicated consideration in the design of fusion algorithms. A novel approach for jointly computing deblurred rolling-shutter artifact corrected high-speed videos with frame rates up to 10000 FPS using inherently blurry rolling shutter CIS frames of 120 FPS to 150 FPS in conjunction with EVS data from a hybrid CIS-EVS sensor is presented.

    "abstract": "Weakly-supervised Video Anomaly Detection (wVAD) aims to detect frame-level anomalies using only video-level labels in training. Due to the limitation of coarse-grained labels Multi-Instance Learning (MIL) is prevailing in wVAD. However MIL suffers from insufficiency of binary supervision to model diverse abnormal patterns. Besides the coupling between abnormality and its context hinders the learning of clear abnormal event boundary. In this paper we propose prompt-enhanced MIL to detect various abnormal events while ensuring clear event boundaries. Concretely we design the abnormal-aware prompts by using abnormal class annotations together with learnable prompt which can incorporate semantic priors into video features dynamically. The detector can utilize the semantic-rich features to capture diverse abnormal patterns. In addition normal context prompt is introduced to amplify the distinction between abnormality and its context facilitating the generation of clear boundary. With the mutual enhancement of abnormal-aware and normal context prompt the model can construct discriminative representations to detect divergent anomalies without ambiguous event boundaries.

In this paper we leverage the power of diffusion models and propose a novel framework tailored for character animation. To preserve consistency of intricate appearance features from reference image we design ReferenceNet to merge detail features via spatial attention. To ensure controllability and continuity we introduce an efficient pose guider to direct character's movements and employ an effective temporal modeling approach to ensure smooth inter-frame transitions between video frames.

These approaches often require retraining/fine-tuning using a few images leading to time-consuming training processes and impeding their swift implementation. Furthermore the reliance on multiple images to represent a singular concept increases the difficulty of customization. To this end we propose FreeCustom a novel tuning-free method to generate customized images of multi-concept composition based on reference concepts using only one image per concept as input. Specifically we introduce a new multi-reference self-attention (MRSA) mechanism and a weighted mask strategy that enables the generated image to access and focus more on the reference concepts. In addition MRSA leverages our key finding that input concepts are better preserved when providing images with context interactions. Experiments show that our method's produced images are consistent with the given concepts and better aligned with the input text.

To address these issues this paper breaks down the text-based video editing task into two stages. First we leverage an pre-trained text-to-image diffusion model to simultaneously edit few keyframes in an zero-shot way. Second we introduce an efficient model called MaskINT which is built on non-autoregressive masked generative transformers and specializes in frame interpolation between the edited keyframes using the structural guidance from intermediate frames.

Despite their performance because improving performance on new tasks requires task-specific knowledge their adaptation is essential. While labels are needed for the adaptation acquiring them is typically expensive. To overcome this challenge active learning a method of achieving a high performance by obtaining labels for a small number of samples from experts has been studied. Active learning primarily focuses on selecting unlabeled samples for labeling and leveraging them to train models. In this study we pose the question \"how can the pre-trained VLMs be adapted under the active learning framework?\" In response to this inquiry we observe that (1) simply applying a conventional active learning framework to pre-trained VLMs even may degrade performance compared to random selection because of the class imbalance in labeling candidates and (2) the knowledge of VLMs can provide hints for achieving the balance before labeling. Based on these observations we devise a novel active learning framework for VLMs denoted as PCB. To assess the effectiveness of our approach we conduct experiments on seven different real-world datasets and the results demonstrate that PCB surpasses conventional active learning and random sampling methods",

Therefore to learn the multi-dimensional human preferences we propose the Multi-dimensional Preference Score (MPS) the first multi-dimensional preference scoring model for the evaluation of text-to-image models.

While recent methods for view synthesis based on diffusion have shown great progress achieving consistency among various view estimates and at the same time abiding by the desired camera pose remains a critical problem yet to be solved. In this work we demonstrate a strikingly simple method where we utilize a pre-trained video diffusion model to solve this problem. Our key idea is that synthesizing a novel view could be reformulated as synthesizing a video of a camera going around the object of interest---a scanning video---which then allows us to leverage the powerful priors that a video diffusion model would have learned. Thus to perform novel-view synthesis we create a smooth camera trajectory to the target view that we wish to render and denoise using both a view-conditioned diffusion model and a video diffusion model.

    "abstract": "Accurately detecting active objects undergoing state changes is essential for comprehending human interactions and facilitating decision-making. The existing methods for active object detection (AOD) primarily rely on visual appearance of the objects within input such as changes in size shape and relationship with hands. However these visual changes can be subtle posing challenges particularly in scenarios with multiple distracting no-change instances of the same category. We observe that the state changes are often the result of an interaction being performed upon the object thus propose to use informed priors about object related plausible interactions (including semantics and visual appearance) to provide more reliable cues for AOD. Specifically we propose a knowledge aggregation procedure to integrate the aforementioned informed priors into oracle queries within the teacher decoder offering more object affordance commonsense to locate the active object. To streamline the inference process and reduce extra knowledge inputs we propose a knowledge distillation approach that encourages the student decoder to mimic the detection capabilities of the teacher decoder using the oracle query by replicating its predictions and attention. Our proposed framework achieves state-of-the-art performance on four datasets namely Ego4D Epic-Kitchens MECCANO and 100DOH which demonstrates the effectiveness of our approach in improving AOD.

Continual learning (CL) aims to overcome this limitation by enabling DNNs to incrementally accumulate knowledge. A widely adopted scenario in CL is class-incremental learning (CIL) where DNNs are required to sequentially learn more classes. Among the various strategies in CL replay methods which revisit previous classes stand out as the only effective ones in CIL. Other strategies such as architectural modifications to segregate information across weights and protect them from change are ineffective in CIL. This is because they need additional information during testing to select the correct network parts to use. In this paper we propose NICE Neurogenesis Inspired Contextual Encoding a replay-free architectural method inspired by adult neurogenesis in the hippocampus. NICE groups neurons in the DNN based on different maturation stages and infers which neurons to use during testing without any additional signal. Through extensive experiments across 6 datasets and 3 architectures we show that NICE performs on par with or often outperforms replay methods. We also make the case that neurons exhibit highly distinctive activation patterns for the classes in which they specialize enabling us to determine when they should be used.

However only a few works consider human-scene interactions together with text conditions which is crucial for visual and physical realism. This paper focuses on the task of generating human motions in 3D indoor scenes given text descriptions of the human-scene interactions. This task presents challenges due to the multimodality nature of text scene and motion as well as the need for spatial reasoning. To address these challenges we propose a new approach that decomposes the complex problem into two more manageable sub-problems: (1) language grounding of the target object and (2) object-centric motion generation. For language grounding of the target object we leverage the power of large language models. For motion generation we design an object-centric scene representation for the generative model to focus on the target object thereby reducing the scene complexity and facilitating the modeling of the relationship between human motions and the object.

Current methods often rely on supplementary modules or specific architectural designs potentially limiting their applicability to new and evolving architectures. To our knowledge we are the first to propose a versatile technique that seamlessly integrates into any existing framework for 3D Object Detection marking the first instance of Weak-to-Strong generalization in 3D computer vision. We introduce a novel framework X-Ray Distillation with Object-Complete Frames suitable for both supervised and semi-supervised settings that leverages the temporal aspect of point cloud sequences. This method extracts crucial information from both previous and subsequent LiDAR frames creating Object-Complete frames that represent objects from multiple viewpoints thus addressing occlusion and sparsity.

This technique encourages the strong Student model to emulate the behavior of the weaker Teacher which processes simple and informative Object-Complete frames effectively offering a comprehensive view of objects as if seen through X-ray vision. Our proposed methods surpass state-of-the-art in semi-supervised learning by 1-1.5 mAP and enhance the performance of five established supervised models by 1-2 mAP on standard autonomous driving datasets even with default hyperparameters.

With multiple sound sources and background disturbances involved establishing robust correspondences between audio and visual contents poses unique challenges due to (1) complex entanglement across sound sources and (2) frequent changes in the occurrence of distinct sound events. Assuming sound events occur independently the multi-source semantic space can be represented as the Cartesian product of single-source sub-spaces. We are motivated to decompose the multi-source audio semantics into single-source semantics for more effective interactions with visual content. We propose a semantic decomposition method based on product quantization where the multi-source semantics can be decomposed and represented by several disentangled and noise-suppressed single-source semantics. Furthermore we introduce a global-to-local quantization mechanism which distills knowledge from stable global (clip-level) features into local (frame-level) ones to handle frequent changes in audio semantics.

Given the evolving environment and the multitude of object classes it is impractical to include all possible classes during the training stage.

However directly adopting recent open-vocabulary classification models like Contrastive Language Image Pretraining (CLIP) poses its unique challenges. Specifically we observe that CLIP's performance is heavily affected by the viewpoint and occlusions compromising its reliability in unconstrained embodied perception scenarios. Further the sequential nature of observations in agent-environment interactions necessitates an effective method for integrating features that maintains discriminative strength for open-vocabulary classification. To address these issues we introduce a novel agent for active open-vocabulary recognition.

In this paper we investigate the possibility of defending against backdoor attacks by utilizing test-time partially poisoned data to remove the backdoor from the model. To address the problem a two-stage method TTBD is proposed. In the first stage we propose a backdoor sample detection method DDP to identify poisoned samples from a batch of mixed partially poisoned samples. Once the poisoned samples are detected we employ Shapley estimation to calculate the contribution of each neuron's significance in the network locate the poisoned neurons and prune them to remove backdoor in the models. Our experiments demonstrate that TTBD removes the backdoor successfully with only a batch of partially poisoned data across different model architectures and datasets against different types of backdoor attacks",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Domain shift is a challenge for supervised human pose estimation where the source data and target data come from different distributions. This is why pose estimation methods generally perform worse on the test set than on the training set. Recently test-time adaptation has proven to be an effective way to deal with domain shift in human pose estimation. Although the performance on the target domain has been improved existing methods require a large number of weight updates for convergence which is time-consuming and brings catastrophic forgetting. To solve these issues we propose a meta-auxiliary learning method to achieve fast adaptation for domain shift during inference. Specifically we take human pose estimation as the supervised primary task and propose body-specific image inpainting as a self-supervised auxiliary task. First we jointly train the primary and auxiliary tasks to get a pre-trained model on the source domain. Then meta-training correlates the performance of the two tasks to learn a good weight initialization. Finally meta-testing adapts the meta-learned model to the target data through self-supervised learning. Benefiting from the meta-learning paradigm the proposed method enables fast adaptation to the target domain while preserving the source domain knowledge. The carefully designed auxiliary task better pays attention to human-related semantics in a single image. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our test-time fast adaptation",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Solving complex visual tasks such as \"Who invented the musical instrument on the right?\" involves a composition of skills: understanding space recognizing instruments and also retrieving prior knowledge. Recent work shows promise by decomposing such tasks using a large language model (LLM) into an executable program that invokes specialized vision models. However generated programs are error-prone: they omit necessary steps include spurious ones and are unable to recover when the specialized models give incorrect outputs. Moreover they require loading multiple models incurring high latency and computation costs. We propose Visual Program Distillation (VPD) an instruction-tuning framework that produces a vision-language model (VLM) capable of solving complex visual tasks with a single forward pass. VPD distills the reasoning ability of LLMs by using them to sample multiple candidate programs which are then executed and verified to identify the correct one. It translates each correct program into a language description of the reasoning steps which are then distilled into a VLM. Extensive experiments show that VPD improves the VLM's ability to count understand spatial relations and reason compositionally. Our VPD-trained PaLI-X outperforms all prior VLMs achieving state-of-the-art performance across complex vision tasks including MMBench OK-VQA A-OKVQA TallyQA POPE and Hateful Memes. An evaluation with human annotators also confirms that VPD improves model response factuality and consistency. Finally experiments on content moderation demonstrate that VPD is also helpful for adaptation to real-world applications with limited data",

To accomplish this we look for a unified approach to video understanding which combines shared temporal modelling of human actions with minimal overhead to support multiple downstream tasks and enable cooperation when learning novel skills. We then propose EgoPack a solution that creates a collection of task perspectives that can be carried across downstream tasks and used as a potential source of additional insights as a backpack of skills that a robot can carry around and use when needed.

In this paper we introduce a universal visual in-context prompting framework for both tasks as shown in Fig.1.

    "abstract": "We present HAAR a new strand-based generative model for 3D human hairstyles. Specifically based on textual inputs HAAR produces 3D hairstyles that could be used as production-level assets in modern computer graphics engines. Current AI-based generative models take advantage of powerful 2D priors to reconstruct 3D content in the form of point clouds meshes or volumetric functions. However by using the 2D priors they are intrinsically limited to only recovering the visual parts. Highly occluded hair structures can not be reconstructed with those methods and they only model the \"outer shell\" which is not ready to be used in physics-based rendering or simulation pipelines. In contrast we propose a first text-guided generative method that uses 3D hair strands as an underlying representation. Leveraging 2D visual question-answering (VQA) systems we automatically annotate synthetic hair models that are generated from a small set of artist-created hairstyles. This allows us to train a latent diffusion model that operates in a common hairstyle UV space. In qualitative and quantitative studies we demonstrate the capabilities of the proposed model and compare it to existing hairstyle generation approaches.

Existing methods normally learn a neural field for the whole scene while it is still under-explored how to reconstruct a target object indicated by users. Considering the Segment Anything Model (SAM) has shown effectiveness in segmenting any 2D images in this paper we propose NTO3D a novel high-quality Neural Target Object 3D (NTO3D) reconstruction method which leverages the benefits of both neural field and SAM. We first propose a novel strategy to lift the multi-view 2D segmentation masks of SAM into a unified 3D occupancy field. The 3D occupancy field is then projected into 2D space and generates the new prompts for SAM. This process is iterative until convergence to separate the target object from the scene. After this we then lift the 2D features of the SAM encoder into a 3D feature field in order to improve the reconstruction quality of the target object. NTO3D lifts the 2D masks and features of SAM into the 3D neural field for high-quality neural target object 3D reconstruction.

A significant challenge arises from the scarcity of diverse medical images spanning various modalities and anatomical regions which is essential in real-world medical applications. To solve this problem in this paper we introduce OmniMedVQA a novel comprehensive medical Visual Question Answering (VQA) benchmark. This benchmark is collected from 73 different medical datasets including 12 different modalities and covering more than 20 distinct anatomical regions. Importantly all images in this benchmark are sourced from authentic medical scenarios ensuring alignment with the requirements of the medical field and suitability for evaluating LVLMs. Through our extensive experiments we have found that existing LVLMs struggle to address these medical VQA problems effectively. Moreover what surprises us is that medical-specialized LVLMs even exhibit inferior performance to those general-domain models calling for a more versatile and robust LVLM in the biomedical field. The evaluation results not only reveal the current limitations of LVLM in understanding real medical images but also highlight our dataset's significance.

Under this setting the model can perceive tasks from prompts and accomplish them without any extra task-specific head predictions or model fine-tuning. However skeleton sequence modeling via in-context learning remains unexplored. Directly applying existing in-context models from other areas onto skeleton sequences fails due to the similarity between inter-frame and cross-task poses which makes it exceptionally hard to perceive the task correctly from a subtle context. To address this challenge we propose Skeleton-in-Context (SiC) an effective framework for in-context skeleton sequence modeling. Our SiC is able to handle multiple skeleton-based tasks simultaneously after a single training process and accomplish each task from context according to the given prompt. It can further generalize to new unseen tasks according to customized prompts. To facilitate context perception we additionally propose a task-unified prompt which adaptively learns tasks of different natures such as partial joint-level generation sequence-level prediction or 2D-to-3D motion prediction. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the effectiveness of our SiC on multiple tasks including motion prediction pose estimation joint completion and future pose estimation. We also evaluate its generalization capability on unseen tasks such as motion-in-between.

This paper aims to democratise high-resolution GenAI by advancing the frontier of high-resolution generation while remaining accessible to a broad audience. We demonstrate that existing Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs) possess untapped potential for higher-resolution image generation. Our novel DemoFusion framework seamlessly extends open-source GenAI models employing Progressive Upscaling Skip Residual and Dilated Sampling mechanisms to achieve higher-resolution image generation.

    "abstract": "In this paper we address the challenging problem of visual SLAM with neural scene representations. Recently neural scene representations have shown promise for SLAM to produce dense 3D scene reconstruction with high quality. However existing methods require scene-specific optimization leading to time-consuming mapping processes for each individual scene. To overcome this limitation we propose IBD-SLAM an Image-Based Depth fusion framework for generalizable SLAM. In particular we adopt a Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) for scene representation. Inspired by multi-view image-based rendering instead of learning a fixed-grid scene representation we propose to learn an image-based depth fusion model that fuses depth maps of multiple reference views into a xyz-map representation. Once trained this model can be applied to new uncalibrated monocular RGBD videos of unseen scenes without the need for retraining and reconstructs full 3D scenes efficiently with a light-weight pose optimization procedure. We thoroughly evaluate IBD-SLAM on public visual SLAM benchmarks outperforming the previous state-of-the-art while being 10x faster in the mapping stage.

SfM is a classic computer vision problem that is solved though iterative minimization of reprojection errors referred to as Bundle Adjustment (BA) starting from a good initialization. In order to obtain a good enough initialization to BA conventional methods rely on a sequence of sub-problems (such as pairwise pose estimation pose averaging or triangulation) which provide an initial solution that can then be refined using BA. In this work we replace these sub-problems by learning a model that takes as input the 2D keypoints detected across multiple views and outputs the corresponding camera poses and 3D keypoint coordinates. Our model takes advantage of graph neural networks to learn SfM-specific primitives and we show that it can be used for fast inference of the reconstruction for new and unseen sequences. The experimental results show that the proposed model outperforms competing learning-based methods and challenges COLMAP while having lower runtime.

Although some methods attempt to incorporate other modalities such as gait or body shape they encode the additional modality separately resulting in extra computational costs and lacking an inherent connection with appearance. In this paper we explore the use of implicit 3-D body shape representations as pixel-level guidance to augment the extraction of identity features with body shape knowledge in addition to appearance. Using body shape as supervision rather than as input provides shape-aware enhancements without any increase in computational cost and delivers coherent integration with pixel-wise appearance features. Moreover for video-based person re-identification we align pixel-level features across frames with shape awareness to ensure temporal consistency. Our results demonstrate that incorporating body shape as pixel-level supervision reduces rank-1 errors by 1.4% for frame-based and by 2.5% for video-based re-identification tasks respectively and can also be generalized to other existing appearance-based person re-identification methods",

In this paper we are the first to explore regression-friendly quantization and conduct full quantization on various detectors. We reveal the intrinsic reason behind the difficulty of quantizing regressors with empirical and theoretical justifications and introduce a novel Regression-specialized Post-Training Quantization (Reg-PTQ) scheme.

Extensive experiments on prevalent detectors showcase the effectiveness of the well-designed Reg-PTQ.

Although efforts have been made to improve few-shot ability of CLIP key factors on the effectiveness of existing methods have not been well studied limiting further exploration of CLIP's potential in few-shot learning. In this paper we first introduce a unified formulation to analyze CLIP-based few-shot learning methods from a perspective of logit bias which encourages us to learn an effective logit bias for further improving performance of CLIP-based few-shot learning methods. To this end we disassemble three key components involved in computation of logit bias (i.e. logit features logit predictor and logit fusion) and empirically analyze the effect on performance of few-shot classification. Based on analysis of key components this paper proposes a novel AMU-Tuning method to learn effective logit bias for CLIP-based few-shot classification. Specifically our AMU-Tuning predicts logit bias by exploiting the appropriate Auxiliary features which are fed into an efficient feature-initialized linear classifier with Multi-branch training. Finally an Uncertainty-based fusion is developed to incorporate logit bias into CLIP for few-shot classification.

    "abstract": "Existing research based on deep learning has extensively explored the problem of daytime image dehazing. However few studies have considered the characteristics of nighttime hazy scenes. There are two distinctions between nighttime and daytime haze. First there may be multiple active colored light sources with lower illumination intensity in nighttime scenes which may cause haze glow and noise with localized coupled and frequency inconsistent characteristics. Second due to the domain discrepancy between simulated and real-world data unrealistic brightness may occur when applying a dehazing model trained on simulated data to real-world data. To address the above two issues we propose a semi-supervised model for real-world nighttime dehazing.

    "abstract": "Data-Free Knowledge Distillation (DFKD) is a promising task to train high-performance small models to enhance actual deployment without relying on the original training data. Existing methods commonly avoid relying on private data by utilizing synthetic or sampled data. However a long-overlooked issue is that the severe distribution shifts between their substitution and original data which manifests as huge differences in the quality of images and class proportions. The harmful shifts are essentially the confounder that significantly causes performance bottlenecks. To tackle the issue this paper proposes a novel perspective with causal inference to disentangle the student models from the impact of such shifts. By designing a customized causal graph we first reveal the causalities among the variables in the DFKD task. Subsequently we propose a Knowledge Distillation Causal Intervention (KDCI) framework based on the backdoor adjustment to de-confound the confounder. KDCI can be flexibly combined with most existing state-of-the-art baselines. Experiments in combination with six representative DFKD methods demonstrate the effectiveness of our KDCI which can obviously help existing methods under almost all settings e.g. improving the baseline by up to 15.54% accuracy on the CIFAR-100 dataset",

In this work we introduce and explore Weakly-Supervised Video Paragraph Grounding (WSVPG) to eliminate the need of temporal annotations. Different from previous weakly-supervised grounding frameworks based on multiple instance learning or reconstruction learning for two-stage candidate ranking we propose a novel siamese learning framework that jointly learns the cross-modal feature alignment and temporal coordinate regression without timestamp labels to achieve concise one-stage localization for WSVPG. Specifically we devise a Siamese Grounding TRansformer (SiamGTR) consisting of two weight-sharing branches for learning complementary supervision. An Augmentation Branch is utilized for directly regressing the temporal boundaries of a complete paragraph within a pseudo video and an Inference Branch is designed to capture the order-guided feature correspondence for localizing multiple sentences in a normal video.

Previous researches mainly focus on improving adversarial robustness in the fully supervised setting leaving the challenging domain of zero-shot adversarial robustness an open question.

We propose LAAT a Language-driven Anchor-based Adversarial Training strategy. LAAT utilizes the features of a text encoder for each category as fixed anchors (normalized feature embeddings) for each category which are then employed for adversarial training. By leveraging the semantic consistency of the text encoders LAAT aims to enhance the adversarial robustness of the image model on novel categories. However naively using text encoders leads to poor results. Through analysis we identified the issue to be the high cosine similarity between text encoders. We then design an expansion algorithm and an alignment cross-entropy loss to alleviate the problem. Our experimental results demonstrated that LAAT significantly improves zero-shot adversarial robustness over state-of-the-art methods. LAAT has the potential to enhance adversarial robustness by large-scale multimodal models especially when labeled data is unavailable during training",

Due to the inherent property of diffusion models most existing methods need long serial sampling chains to restore HQ images step-by-step resulting in expensive sampling time and high computation costs. Moreover such long sampling chains hinder understanding the relationship between inputs and restoration results since it is hard to compute the gradients in the whole chains. In this work we aim to rethink the diffusion model-based IR models through a different perspective i.e. a deep equilibrium (DEQ) fixed point system called DeqIR. Specifically we derive an analytical solution by modeling the entire sampling chain in these IR models as a joint multivariate fixed point system. Based on the analytical solution we can conduct parallel sampling and restore HQ images without training. Furthermore we compute fast gradients via DEQ inversion and found that initialization optimization can boost image quality and control the generation direction.

    "abstract": "Object detection with event cameras benefits from the sensor's low latency and high dynamic range. However it is costly to fully label event streams for supervised training due to their high temporal resolution. To reduce this cost we present LEOD the first method for label-efficient event-based detection. Our approach unifies weakly- and semi-supervised object detection with a self-training mechanism. We first utilize a detector pre-trained on limited labels to produce pseudo ground truth on unlabeled events. Then the detector is re-trained with both real and generated labels. Leveraging the temporal consistency of events we run bi-directional inference and apply tracking-based post-processing to enhance the quality of pseudo labels. To stabilize training against label noise we further design a soft anchor assignment strategy. We introduce new experimental protocols to evaluate the task of label-efficient event-based detection on Gen1 and 1Mpx datasets. LEOD consistently outperforms supervised baselines across various labeling ratios. For example on Gen1 it improves mAP by 8.6% and 7.8% for RVT-S trained with 1% and 2% labels. On 1Mpx RVT-S with 10% labels even surpasses its fully-supervised counterpart using 100% labels. LEOD maintains its effectiveness even when all labeled data are available reaching new state-of-the-art results. Finally we show that our method readily scales to improve larger detectors as well.

However the slide representations resulting from this approach are highly tailored to specific clinical tasks which limits their expressivity and generalization particularly in scenarios with limited data. Instead we hypothesize that morphological redundancy in tissue can be leveraged to build a task-agnostic slide representation in an unsupervised fashion. To this end we introduce PANTHER a prototype-based approach rooted in the Gaussian mixture model that summarizes the set of WSI patches into a much smaller set of morphological prototypes. Specifically each patch is assumed to have been generated from a mixture distribution where each mixture component represents a morphological exemplar. Utilizing the estimated mixture parameters we then construct a compact slide representation that can be readily used for a wide range of downstream tasks. By performing an extensive evaluation of PANTHER on subtyping and survival tasks using 13 datasets we show that 1) PANTHER outperforms or is on par with supervised MIL baselines and 2) the analysis of morphological prototypes brings new qualitative and quantitative insights into model interpretability.

The computer vision community has witnessed a blossom of polarization-based vision applications such as reflection removal shape-from-polarization (SfP) transparent object segmentation and color constancy partially due to the emergence of single-chip mono/color polarization sensors that make polarization data acquisition easier than ever. However is polarization-based vision vulnerable to adversarial attacks? If so is that possible to realize these adversarial attacks in the physical world without being perceived by human eyes? In this paper we warn the community of the vulnerability of polarization-based vision which can be more serious than RGB-based vision. By adapting a commercial LCD projector we achieve locally controllable polarizing projection which is successfully utilized to fool state-of-the-art polarization-based vision algorithms for glass segmentation and SfP. Compared with existing physical attacks on RGB-based vision which always suffer from the trade-off between attack efficacy and eye conceivability the adversarial attackers based on polarizing projection are contact-free and visually imperceptible since naked human eyes can rarely perceive the difference of viciously manipulated polarizing light and ordinary illumination. This poses unprecedented risks on polarization-based vision for which due attentions should be paid and counter measures be considered",

They are however too slow in practice to track every point observed in a single frame in a reasonable amount of time. This paper introduces DOT a novel simple and efficient method for solving this problem. It first extracts a small set of tracks from key regions at motion boundaries using an off-the-shelf point tracking algorithm. Given source and target frames DOT then computes rough initial estimates of a dense flow field and visibility mask through nearest-neighbor interpolation before refining them using a learnable optical flow estimator that explicitly handles occlusions and can be trained on synthetic data with ground-truth correspondences. We show that DOT is significantly more accurate than current optical flow techniques outperforms sophisticated \"universal\" trackers like OmniMotion and is on par with or better than the best point tracking algorithms like CoTracker while being at least two orders of magnitude faster.

    "abstract": "Split Learning (SL) is a distributed learning framework renowned for its privacy-preserving features and minimal computational requirements. Previous research consistently highlights the potential privacy breaches in SL systems by server adversaries reconstructing training data. However these studies often rely on strong assumptions or compromise system utility to enhance attack performance. This paper introduces a new semi-honest Data Reconstruction Attack on SL named Feature-Oriented Reconstruction Attack (FORA). In contrast to prior works FORA relies on limited prior knowledge specifically that the server utilizes auxiliary samples from the public without knowing any client's private information. This allows FORA to conduct the attack stealthily and achieve robust performance. The key vulnerability exploited by FORA is the revelation of the model representation preference in the smashed data output by victim client. FORA constructs a substitute client through feature-level transfer learning aiming to closely mimic the victim client's representation preference. Leveraging this substitute client the server trains the attack model to effectively reconstruct private data. Extensive experiments showcase FORA's superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.

    "abstract": "With the rapid development of face recognition (FR) systems the privacy of face images on social media is facing severe challenges due to the abuse of unauthorized FR systems. Some studies utilize adversarial attack techniques to defend against malicious FR systems by generating adversarial examples. However the generated adversarial examples i.e. the protected face images tend to suffer from subpar visual quality and low transferability. In this paper we propose a novel face protection approach dubbed DiffAM which leverages the powerful generative ability of diffusion models to generate high-quality protected face images with adversarial makeup transferred from reference images. To be specific we first introduce a makeup removal module to generate non-makeup images utilizing a fine-tuned diffusion model with guidance of textual prompts in CLIP space. As the inverse process of makeup transfer makeup removal can make it easier to establish the deterministic relationship between makeup domain and non-makeup domain regardless of elaborate text prompts. Then with this relationship a CLIP-based makeup loss along with an ensemble attack strategy is introduced to jointly guide the direction of adversarial makeup domain achieving the generation of protected face images with natural-looking makeup and high black-box transferability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DiffAM achieves higher visual quality and attack success rates with a gain of 12.98% under black-box setting compared with the state of the arts.

    "abstract": "Recently there has been a lot of progress in reducing the computation of deep models at inference time. These methods can reduce both the computational needs and power usage of deep models. Some of these approaches adaptively scale the compute based on the input instance. We show that such models can be vulnerable to a universal adversarial patch attack where the attacker optimizes for a patch that when pasted on any image can increase the compute and power consumption of the model. We run experiments with three different efficient vision transformer methods showing that in some cases the attacker can increase the computation to the maximum possible level by simply pasting a patch that occupies only 8% of the image area. We also show that a standard adversarial training defense method can reduce some of the attack's success. We believe adaptive efficient methods will be necessary for the future to lower the power usage of expensive deep models so we hope our paper encourages the community to study the robustness of these methods and develop better defense methods for the proposed attack.

To enhance the ICL performance in this study we use Visual Question Answering (VQA) as case study to explore diverse in-context configurations to find the powerful ones. Additionally through observing the changes of the LVLM outputs by altering the in-context sequence we gain insights into the inner properties of LVLMs improving our understanding of them. Specifically to explore in-context configurations we design diverse retrieval methods and employ different strategies to manipulate the retrieved demonstrations.

Current 3D GAN architectures however typically rely on volume representations which are slow to render thereby hampering the GAN training and requiring multi-view-inconsistent 2D upsamplers. Here we introduce Gaussian Shell Maps (GSMs) as a framework that connects SOTA generator network architectures with emerging 3D Gaussian rendering primitives using an articulable multi shell--based scaffold. In this setting a CNN generates a 3D texture stack with features that are mapped to the shells. The latter represent inflated and deflated versions of a template surface of a digital human in a canonical body pose. Instead of rasterizing the shells directly we sample 3D Gaussians on the shells whose attributes are encoded in the texture features. These Gaussians are efficiently and differentiably rendered. The ability to articulate the shells is important during GAN training and at inference time to deform a body into arbitrary user-defined poses. Our efficient rendering scheme bypasses the need for view-inconsistent upsamplers and achieves high-quality multi-view consistent renderings at a native resolution of 512 x512 pixels. We demonstrate that GSMs successfully generate 3D humans when trained on single-view datasets including SHHQ and DeepFashion",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "The task of No-Reference Image Quality Assessment (NR-IQA) is to estimate the quality score of an input image without additional information. NR-IQA models play a crucial role in the media industry aiding in performance evaluation and optimization guidance. However these models are found to be vulnerable to adversarial attacks which introduce imperceptible perturbations to input images resulting in significant changes in predicted scores. In this paper we propose a defense method to mitigate the variability in predicted scores caused by small perturbations thus enhancing the adversarial robustness of NR-IQA models. To be specific we present theoretical evidence showing that the extent of score changes is related to the l_1 norm of the gradient of the predicted score with respect to the input image when adversarial perturbations are l_inf-bounded. Building on this theoretical foundation we propose a norm regularization training strategy aimed at reducing the l_1 norm of the gradient thereby boosting the adversarial robustness of NR-IQA models. Experiments conducted on four NR-IQA baseline models demonstrate the effectiveness of our strategy in reducing score changes in the presence of adversarial attacks. To the best of our knowledge this work marks the first attempt to defend against adversarial attacks on NR-IQA models. Our study offers valuable insights into the adversarial robustness of NR-IQA models and provides a foundation for future research in this area",

However existing technical approaches for analyzing and synthesizing hand-object manipulation are mostly limited to handling a single hand and object due to the lack of data support. To address this we construct TACO an extensive bimanual hand-object-interaction dataset spanning a large variety of tool-action-object compositions for daily human activities. TACO contains 2.5K motion sequences paired with third-person and egocentric views precise hand-object 3D meshes and action labels. To rapidly expand the data scale we present a fully automatic data acquisition pipeline combining multi-view sensing with an optical motion capture system. With the vast research fields provided by TACO we benchmark three generalizable hand-object-interaction tasks: compositional action recognition generalizable hand-object motion forecasting and cooperative grasp synthesis.

This challenge lies in the lack of clear separation between content and style of a motion. To tackle this challenge we propose a novel motion style transformer that effectively disentangles style from content and generates a plausible motion with transferred style from a source motion. Our distinctive approach to achieving the goal of disentanglement is twofold: (1) a new architecture for motion style transformer with 'part-attentive style modulator across body parts' and 'Siamese encoders that encode style and content features separately'; (2) style disentanglement loss.

    "abstract": "The quality of the prompts provided to text-to-image diffusion models determines how faithful the generated content is to the user's intent often requiring `prompt engineering'. To harness visual concepts from target images without prompt engineering current approaches largely rely on embedding inversion by optimizing and then mapping them to pseudo-tokens. However working with such high-dimensional vector representations is challenging because they lack semantics and interpretability and only allow simple vector operations when using them. Instead this work focuses on inverting the diffusion model to obtain interpretable language prompts directly. The challenge of doing this lies in the fact that the resulting optimization problem is fundamentally discrete and the space of prompts is exponentially large; this makes using standard optimization techniques such as stochastic gradient descent difficult. To this end we utilize a delayed projection scheme to optimize for prompts representative of the vocabulary space in the model. Further we leverage the findings that different timesteps of the diffusion process cater to different levels of detail in an image. The later noisy timesteps of the forward diffusion process correspond to the semantic information and therefore prompt inversion in this range provides tokens representative of the image semantics. We show that our approach can identify semantically interpretable and meaningful prompts for a target image which can be used to synthesize diverse images with similar content. We further illustrate the application of the optimized prompts in evolutionary image generation and concept removal",

However the acquisition of HSIs is always costly and time-intensive resulting in a severe data-thirsty issue in HSI research and applications. Current solutions have not been able to generate a sufficient volume of diverse and reliable synthetic HSIs. To this end our study formulates a novel generalized paradigm for HSI synthesis i.e. unmixing before fusion that initiates with unmixing across multi-source data and follows by fusion-based synthesis. By integrating unmixing this work maps unpaired HSI and RGB data to a low-dimensional abundance space greatly alleviating the difficulty of generating high-dimensional samples. Moreover incorporating abundances inferred from unpaired RGB images into generative models allows for cost-effective supplementation of various realistic spatial distributions in abundance synthesis. Our proposed paradigm can be instrumental with a series of deep generative models filling a significant gap in the field and enabling the generation of vast high-quality HSI samples for large-scale downstream tasks. Extension experiments on downstream tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of synthesized HSIs. The code is available at: HSI-Synthesis.github.io",

    "abstract": "Neural implicit fields have been a de facto standard in novel view synthesis. Recently there exist some methods exploring fusing multiple modalities within a single field aiming to share implicit features from different modalities to enhance reconstruction performance. However these modalities often exhibit misaligned behaviors: optimizing for one modality such as LiDAR can adversely affect another like camera performance and vice versa. In this work we conduct comprehensive analyses on the multimodal implicit field of LiDAR-camera joint synthesis revealing the underlying issue lies in the misalignment of different sensors. Furthermore we introduce AlignMiF a geometrically aligned multimodal implicit field with two proposed modules: Geometry-Aware Alignment (GAA) and Shared Geometry Initialization (SGI). These modules effectively align the coarse geometry across different modalities significantly enhancing the fusion process between LiDAR and camera data. Through extensive experiments across various datasets and scenes we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in facilitating better interaction between LiDAR and camera modalities within a unified neural field. Specifically our proposed AlignMiF achieves remarkable improvement over recent implicit fusion methods (+2.01 and +3.11 image PSNR on the KITTI-360 and Waymo datasets) and consistently surpasses single modality performance (13.8% and 14.2% reduction in LiDAR Chamfer Distance on the respective datasets)",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Learning representations to capture the very fundamental understanding of the world is a key challenge in machine learning. The hierarchical structure of explanatory factors hidden in data is such a general representation and could be potentially achieved with a hierarchical VAE. However training a hierarchical VAE always suffers from the \"posterior collapse\" where the data information is hard to propagate to the higher-level latent variables hence resulting in a bad hierarchical representation. To address this issue we first analyze the shortcomings of existing methods for mitigating the \"posterior collapse\" from an information theory perspective then highlight the necessity of regularization for explicitly propagating data information to higher-level latent variables while maintaining the dependency between different levels. This naturally leads to formulating the inference of the hierarchical latent representation as a sequential decision process which could benefit from applying reinforcement learning (RL). Aligning RL's objective with the regularization we first introduce a \"skip-generative path\" to acquire a reward for evaluating the information content of an inferred latent representation and then the developed Q-value function based on it could have a consistent optimization direction of the regularization. Finally policy gradient one of the typical RL methods is employed to train a hierarchical VAE without introducing a gradient estimator. Experimental results firmly support our analysis and demonstrate that our proposed method effectively mitigates the \"posterior collapse\" issue learns an informative hierarchy acquires explainable latent representations and significantly outperforms other hierarchical VAE-based methods in downstream tasks",

    "abstract": "Event-based semantic segmentation has gained popularity due to its capability to deal with scenarios under high-speed motion and extreme lighting conditions which cannot be addressed by conventional RGB cameras. Since it is hard to annotate event data previous approaches rely on event-to-image reconstruction to obtain pseudo labels for training. However this will inevitably introduce noise and learning from noisy pseudo labels especially when generated from a single source may reinforce the errors. This drawback is also called confirmation bias in pseudo-labeling. In this paper we propose a novel hybrid pseudo-labeling framework for unsupervised event-based semantic segmentation HPL-ESS to alleviate the influence of noisy pseudo labels. In particular we first employ a plain unsupervised domain adaptation framework as our baseline which can generate a set of pseudo labels through self-training. Then we incorporate offline event-to-image reconstruction into the framework and obtain another set of pseudo labels by predicting segmentation maps on the reconstructed images. A noisy label learning strategy is designed to mix the two sets of pseudo labels and enhance the quality. Moreover we propose a soft prototypical alignment module to further improve the consistency of target domain features.

We achieve this goal by training an additional network to control the frozen upgraded model with the new text-image data pairs. In detail X-Adapter keeps a frozen copy of the old model to preserve the connectors of different plugins. Additionally X-Adapter adds trainable mapping layers that bridge the decoders from models of different versions for feature remapping. The remapped features will be used as guidance for the upgraded model. To enhance the guidance ability of X-Adapter we employ a -text training strategy for the upgraded model. After training we also introduce a two-stage denoising strategy to align the initial latents of X-Adapter and the upgraded model. Thanks to our strategies X-Adapter demonstrates universal compatibility with various plugins and also enables plugins of different versions to work together thereby expanding the functionalities of diffusion community. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed method we conduct extensive experiments and the results show that X-Adapter may facilitate wider application in the upgraded foundational diffusion model.

    "abstract": "The robustness of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) is vital to modern AI-driven systems. It can be quantified by formal verification by providing a certified lower bound within which any perturbation does not alter the original input's classification result. It is challenging due to nonlinear components such as MaxPool. At present many verification methods are sound but risk losing some precision to enhance efficiency and scalability and thus a certified lower bound is a crucial criterion for evaluating the performance of verification tools. In this paper we present MaxLin a robustness verifier for MaxPool-based CNNs with tight Linear approximation. By tightening the linear approximation of the MaxPool function we can certify larger certified lower bounds of CNNs. We evaluate MaxLin with open-sourced benchmarks including LeNet and networks trained on the MNIST CIFAR-10 and Tiny ImageNet datasets. The results show that MaxLin outperforms state-of-the-art tools with up to 110.60% improvement regarding the certified lower bound and 5.13 X speedup for the same neural networks.

Considering the extensive scale of LLM and visual backbone minimal GPU memory is left for facilitating effective temporal modeling which is crucial for comprehending and providing feedback on videos. To this end we propose Branching Temporal Adapter (BT-Adapter) a novel method for extending image-language pretrained models into the video domain. Specifically BT-Adapter serves as a plug-and-use temporal modeling branch alongside the pretrained visual encoder which is tuned while keeping the backbone frozen. Just pretrained once BT-Adapter can be seamlessly integrated into all image conversation models using this version of CLIP enabling video conversations without the need for video instructions. Besides we develop a unique asymmetric token masking strategy inside the branch with tailor-made training tasks for BT-Adapter facilitating faster convergence and better results. Thanks to BT-Adapter we are able to empower existing multimodal dialogue models with strong video understanding capabilities without incurring excessive GPU costs. Without bells and whistles BT-Adapter achieves (1) state-of-the-art zero-shot results on various video tasks using thousands of fewer GPU hours.

However without sufficient semantic comments and structure such programs can be challenging to understand let alone modify. We introduce the problem of semantic commenting CAD programs wherein the goal is to segment the input program into code blocks corresponding to semantically meaningful shape parts and assign a semantic label to each block. We solve the problem by combining program parsing with visual-semantic analysis afforded by recent advances in foundational language and vision models. Specifically by executing the input programs we create shapes which we use to generate conditional photorealistic images to make use of semantic annotators for such images. We then distill the information across the images and link back to the original programs to semantically comment on them. Additionally we collected and annotated a benchmark dataset CADTalk consisting of 5288 machine-made programs and 45 human-made programs with ground truth semantic comments. We extensively evaluated our approach compared it to a GPT-based baseline and an open-set shape segmentation baseline and reported an 83.24% accuracy on the new CADTalk dataset.

    "abstract": "Collecting well-matched multimedia datasets is crucial for training cross-modal retrieval models. However in real-world scenarios massive multimodal data are harvested from the Internet which inevitably contains Partially Mismatched Pairs (PMPs). Undoubtedly such semantical irrelevant data will remarkably harm the cross-modal retrieval performance. Previous efforts tend to mitigate this problem by estimating a soft correspondence to down-weight the contribution of PMPs. In this paper we aim to address this challenge from a new perspective: the potential semantic similarity among unpaired samples makes it possible to excavate useful knowledge from mismatched pairs. To achieve this we propose L2RM a general framework based on Optimal Transport (OT) that learns to rematch mismatched pairs. In detail L2RM aims to generate refined alignments by seeking a minimal-cost transport plan across different modalities. To formalize the rematching idea in OT first we propose a self-supervised cost function that automatically learns from explicit similarity-cost mapping relation. Second we present to model a partial OT problem while restricting the transport among false positives to further boost refined alignments. Extensive experiments on three benchmarks demonstrate our L2RM significantly improves the robustness against PMPs for existing models. The code is available at https://github.com/hhc1997/L2RM",

    "title": "Generate Subgoal Images before Act: Unlocking the Chain-of-Thought Reasoning in Diffusion Model for Robot Manipulation with Multimodal Prompts",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Robotics agents often struggle to understand and follow the multi-modal prompts in complex manipulation scenes which are challenging to be sufficiently and accurately described by text alone. Moreover for long-horizon manipulation tasks the deviation from general instruction tends to accumulate if lack of intermediate guidance from high-level subgoals. For this we consider can we generate subgoal images before act to enhance the instruction following in long-horizon manipulation with multi-modal prompts? Inspired by the great success of diffusion model in image generation tasks we propose a novel hierarchical framework named as CoTDiffusion that incorporates diffusion model as a high-level planner to convert the general and multi-modal prompts into coherent visual subgoal plans which further guide the low-level policy model before action execution. We design a semantic alignment module that can anchor the progress of generated keyframes along a coherent generation chain unlocking the chain-of-thought reasoning ability of diffusion model. Additionally we propose bi-directional generation and frame concat mechanism to further enhance the fidelity of generated subgoal images and the accuracy of instruction following. The experiments cover various robotics manipulation scenarios including visual reasoning visual rearrange and visual constraints. CoTDiffusion achieves outstanding performance gain compared to the baselines without explicit subgoal generation which proves that a subgoal image is worth a thousand words of instruction",

    "abstract": "Self-supervised foundation models have shown great potential in computer vision thanks to the pre-training paradigm of masked autoencoding. Scale is a primary factor influencing the performance of these foundation models. However these large foundation models often result in high computational cost. This paper focuses on pre-training relatively small vision transformer models that could be efficiently adapted to downstream tasks. Specifically taking inspiration from knowledge distillation in model compression we propose a new asymmetric masked distillation (AMD) framework for pre-training relatively small models with autoencoding. The core of AMD is to devise an asymmetric masking strategy where the teacher model is enabled to see more context information with a lower masking ratio while the student model is still equipped with a high masking ratio. We design customized multi-layer feature alignment between the teacher encoder and student encoder to regularize the pre-training of student MAE. To demonstrate the effectiveness and versatility of AMD we apply it to both ImageMAE and VideoMAE for pre-training relatively small ViT models. AMD achieved 84.6% classification accuracy on IN1K using the ViT-B model. And AMD achieves 73.3% classification accuracy using the ViT-B model on the Something-in-Something V2 dataset a 3.7% improvement over the original ViT-B model from VideoMAE. We also transfer AMD pre-trained models to downstream tasks and obtain consistent performance improvement over the original masked autoencoding.

    "abstract": "Despite recent advances in inversion-based editing text-guided image manipulation remains challenging for diffusion models. The primary bottlenecks include 1) the time-consuming nature of the inversion process; 2) the struggle to balance consistency with accuracy; 3) the lack of compatibility with efficient consistency sampling methods used in consistency models. To address the above issues we start by asking ourselves if the inversion process can be eliminated for editing. We show that when the initial sample is known a special variance schedule reduces the denoising step to the same form as the multi-step consistency sampling. We name this Denoising Diffusion Consistent Model (DDCM) and note that it implies a virtual inversion strategy without explicit inversion in sampling. We further unify the attention control mechanisms in a tuning-free framework for text-guided editing. Combining them we present inversion-free editing (InfEdit) which allows for consistent and faithful editing for both rigid and non-rigid semantic changes catering to intricate modifications without compromising on the image's integrity and explicit inversion. Through extensive experiments InfEdit shows strong performance in various editing tasks and also maintains a seamless workflow (less than 3 seconds on one single A40) demonstrating the potential for real-time applications",

Subsequently it refines the other set of advanced queries that focus on the auto-generated visual prompts for unseen tumor segmentation. Moreover we introduce query-knowledge alignment at the feature level to enhance each query's discriminative representation and generalizability.

In this work we introduce MobileCLIP - a new family of efficient image-text models optimized for runtime performance along with a novel and efficient training approach namely multi-modal reinforced training. The proposed training approach leverages knowledge transfer from an image captioning model and an ensemble of strong CLIP encoders to improve the accuracy of efficient models.

MobileCLIP sets a new state-of-the-art latency-accuracy tradeoff for zero-shot classification and retrieval tasks on several datasets.

    "abstract": "Point-based interactive editing serves as an essential tool to complement the controllability of existing generative models. A concurrent work DragDiffusion updates the diffusion latent map in response to user inputs causing global latent map alterations. This results in imprecise preservation of the original content and unsuccessful editing due to gradient vanishing. In contrast we present DragNoise offering robust and accelerated editing without retracing the latent map. The core rationale of DragNoise lies in utilizing the predicted noise output of each U-Net as a semantic editor. This approach is grounded in two critical observations: firstly the bottleneck features of U-Net inherently possess semantically rich features ideal for interactive editing; secondly high-level semantics established early in the denoising process show minimal variation in subsequent stages. Leveraging these insights DragNoise edits diffusion semantics in a single denoising step and efficiently propagates these changes ensuring stability and efficiency in diffusion editing. Comparative experiments reveal that DragNoise achieves superior control and semantic retention reducing the optimization time by over 50% compared to DragDiffusion.

It is difficult to appropriately re-balance the classifiers in SSL because the class distribution of an unlabeled set is often unknown and could be mismatched with that of a labeled set. We propose a novel class-imbalanced SSL algorithm called class-distribution-mismatch-aware debiasing (CDMAD). For each iteration of training CDMAD first assesses the classifier's biased degree towards each class by calculating the logits on an image without any patterns (e.g. solid color image) which can be considered irrelevant to the training set. CDMAD then refines biased pseudo-labels of the base SSL algorithm by ensuring the classifier's neutrality. CDMAD uses these refined pseudo-labels during the training of the base SSL algorithm to improve the quality of the representations. In the test phase CDMAD similarly refines biased class predictions on test samples. CDMAD can be seen as an extension of post-hoc logit adjustment to address a challenge of incorporating the unknown class distribution of the unlabeled set for re-balancing the biased classifier under class distribution mismatch. CDMAD ensures Fisher consistency for the balanced error. Extensive experiments verify the effectiveness of CDMAD",

    "abstract": "Scaled relative pose estimation i.e. estimating relative rotation and scaled relative translation between two images has always been a major challenge in global Structure-from-Motion (SfM). This difficulty arises because the two-view relative translation computed by traditional geometric vision methods e.g. the five-point algorithm is scaleless. Many researchers have proposed diverse translation averaging methods to solve this problem. Instead of solving the problem in the motion averaging phase we focus on estimating scaled relative pose with the help of panoramic cameras and deep neural networks. In this paper a novel network namely PanoPose is proposed to estimate the relative motion in a fully self-supervised manner and a global SfM pipeline is built for panorama images. The proposed PanoPose comprises a depth-net and a pose-net with self-supervision achieved by reconstructing the reference image from its neighboring images based on the estimated depth and relative pose. To maintain precise pose estimation under large viewing angle differences we randomly rotate the panoramic images and pre-train the pose-net with images before and after the rotation. To enhance scale accuracy a fusion block is introduced to incorporate depth information into pose estimation. Extensive experiments on panoramic SfM datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of PanoPose compared with state-of-the-arts",

To aid in this discovery process we explore the task of automatically describing the differences between two sets of images which we term Set Difference Captioning. This task takes in image sets \\mathcal D _A and \\mathcal D _B and outputs a description that is more often true on \\mathcal D _A than \\mathcal D _B. We outline a two-stage approach that first proposes candidate difference descriptions from image sets and then re-ranks the candidates by checking how well they can differentiate the two sets. We introduce VisDiff which first captions the images and prompts a language model to propose candidate descriptions then re-ranks these descriptions using CLIP. To evaluate VisDiff we collect VisDiffBench a dataset with 187 paired image sets with ground truth difference descriptions. We apply VisDiff to various domains such as comparing datasets (e.g. ImageNet vs. ImageNetV2) comparing classification models (e.g. zero-shot CLIP vs. supervised ResNet) characterizing differences between generative models (e.g. StableDiffusionV1 and V2) and discovering what makes images memorable. Using VisDiff we are able to find interesting and previously unknown differences in datasets and models demonstrating its utility in revealing nuanced insights",

    "title": "Discovering and Mitigating Visual Biases through Keyword Explanation",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Addressing biases in computer vision models is crucial for real-world AI deployments. However mitigating visual biases is challenging due to their unexplainable nature often identified indirectly through visualization or sample statistics which necessitates additional human supervision for interpretation. To tackle this issue we propose the Bias-to-Text (B2T) framework which interprets visual biases as keywords. Specifically we extract common keywords from the captions of mispredicted images to identify potential biases in the model. We then validate these keywords by measuring their similarity to the mispredicted images using a vision-language scoring model. The keyword explanation form of visual bias offers several advantages such as a clear group naming for bias discovery and a natural extension for debiasing using these group names. Our experiments demonstrate that B2T can identify known biases such as gender bias in CelebA background bias in Waterbirds and distribution shifts in ImageNet-R/C. Additionally B2T uncovers novel biases in larger datasets such as Dollar Street and ImageNet. For example we discovered a contextual bias between \\keyword bee and \\keyword flower in ImageNet. We also highlight various applications of B2T keywords including debiased training CLIP prompting and model comparison",
