    "title": "Quaternion Equivariant Capsule Networks for 3D Point Clouds",
    "abstract": "We present a 3D capsule module for processing point clouds that is equivariant to 3D rotations and translations, as well as invariant to permutations of the input points. The operator receives a sparse set of local reference frames, computed from an input point cloud and establishes end-to-end transformation equivariance through a novel dynamic routing procedure on quaternions. Further, we theoretically connect dynamic routing between capsules to the well-known Weiszfeld algorithm, a scheme for solving iterative re-weighted least squares (IRLS) problems with provable convergence properties. It is shown that such group dynamic routing can be interpreted as robust IRLS rotation averaging on capsule votes, where information is routed based on the final inlier scores. Based on our operator, we build a capsule network that disentangles geometry from pose, paving the way for more informative descriptors and a structured latent space. Our architecture allows joint object classification and orientation estimation without explicit supervision of rotations. We validate our algorithm empirically on common benchmark datasets",

This method, called DeepFit, incorporates a neural network to learn point-wise weights for weighted least squares polynomial surface fitting. The learned weights act as a soft selection for the neighborhood of surface points thus avoiding the scale selection required of previous methods. To train the network we propose a novel surface consistency loss that improves point weight estimation. The method enables extracting normal vectors and other geometrical properties, such as principal curvatures, the latter were not presented as ground truth during training. We achieve state-of-the-art results on a benchmark normal and curvature estimation dataset,demonstrate robustness to noise, outliers and density variations, and show its application on noise removal",

It comprises of two surrogates, one at the architecture level to improve sample efficiency and one at the weights level, through a supernet, to improve gradient descent training efficiency. On standard benchmark datasets (C10, C100, ImageNet), the resulting models, dubbed NSGANetV2, either match or outperform models from existing approaches with the search being orders of magnitude more sample efficient. Furthermore, we demonstrate the effectiveness and versatility of the proposed method on six diverse non-standard datasets, e.g. STL-10, Flowers102, Oxford Pets, FGVC Aircrafts etc. In all cases, NSGANetV2s improve the state-of-the-art (under mobile setting), suggesting that NAS can be a viable alternative to conventional transfer learning approaches in handling diverse scenarios such as small-scale or fine-grained datasets.

In this paper, we study the problem of describing visual attributes of texture on a novel dataset containing rich descriptions of textures, and conduct a systematic study of current generative and discriminative models for grounding language to images on this dataset. We find that while these models capture some properties of texture, they fail to capture several compositional properties, such as the colors of dots. We provide critical analysis of existing models by generating synthetic but realistic textures with different descriptions. Our dataset also allows us to train interpretable models and generate language-based explanations of what discriminative features are learned by deep networks for fine-grained categorization where texture plays a key role. We present visualizations of several fine-grained domains and show that texture attributes learned on our dataset offer improvements over expert-designed attributes on the Caltech-UCSD Birds dataset",

    "abstract": "This paper presents a novel relational network for group activity recognition. The core of our network is to augment the conditional random fields (CRF), amenable to learning inter-dependency of correlated observations, with the newly devised temporal and spatial self-attention to learn the temporal evolution and spatial relational contexts of every actor in videos. Such a combination utilizes the global receptive fields of self-attention to construct a spatio-temporal graph topology to address the temporal dependency and non-local relationships of the actors. The network first uses the temporal self-attention along with the spatial self-attention, which considers multiple cliques with different scales of locality to account for the diversity of the actors' relationships in group activities, to model the pairwise energy of CRF. Afterward, to accommodate the distinct characteristics of each video, a new mean-field inference algorithm with dynamic halting is also addressed. Finally, a bidirectional universal transformer encoder (UTE), which combines both of the forward and backward temporal context information, is used to aggregate the relational contexts and scene information for group activity recognition. Simulations show that the proposed approach surpasses the state-of-the-art methods on the widespread Volleyball and Collective Activity datasets",

    "abstract": "While attention has been an increasingly popular component in deep neural networks to both interpret and boost performance of models, little work has examined how attention progresses to accomplish a task and whether it is reasonable. In this work, we propose an Attention with Reasoning capability (AiR) framework that uses attention to understand and improve the process leading to task outcomes. We first define an evaluation metric based on a sequence of atomic reasoning operations, enabling quantitative measurement of attention that considers the reasoning process. We then collect human eye-tracking and answer correctness data, and analyze various machine and human attentions on their reasoning capability and how they impact task performance. Furthermore, we propose a supervision method to jointly and progressively optimize attention, reasoning, and task performance so that models learn to look at regions of interests by following a reasoning process. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework in analyzing and modeling attention with better reasoning capability and task performance.

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have recently proven to be capable of predicting reliable 6D pose estimates even from monocular images. Nonetheless, CNNs are identified as being extremely data-driven, and acquiring adequate annotations is oftentimes very time-consuming and labor intensive. To overcome this shortcoming, we propose the idea of monocular 6D pose estimation by means of self-supervised learning, removing the need for real annotations. After training our proposed network fully supervised with synthetic RGB data, we leverage recent advances in neural rendering to further self-supervise the model on unannotated real RGB-D data, seeking for a visually and geometrically optimal alignment. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that our proposed self-supervision is able to significantly enhance the model's original performance, outperforming all other methods relying on synthetic data or employing elaborate techniques from the domain adaptation realm",

    "title": "Invertible Image Rescaling",
    "abstract": "High-resolution digital images are usually downscaled to fit various display screens or save the cost of storage and bandwidth, meanwhile the post-upscaling is adpoted to recover the original resolutions or the details in the zoom-in images. However, typical image downscaling is a non-injective mapping due to the loss of high-frequency information, which leads to the ill-posed problem of the inverse upscaling procedure and poses great challenges for recovering details from the downscaled low-resolution images. Simply upscaling with image super-resolution methods results in unsatisfactory recovering performance. In this work, we propose to solve this problem by modeling the downscaling and upscaling processes from a new perspective, i.e. an invertible bijective transformation, which can largely mitigate the ill-posed nature of image upscaling. We develop an Invertible Rescaling Net (IRN) with deliberately designed framework and objectives to produce visually-pleasing low-resolution images and meanwhile capture the distribution of the lost information using a latent variable following a specified distribution in the downscaling process. In this way, upscaling is made tractable by inversely passing a randomly-drawn latent variable with the low-resolution image through the network. Experimental results demonstrate the significant improvement of our model over existing methods in terms of both quantitative and qualitative evaluations of image upscaling reconstruction from downscaled images.

Our method can synthesize the same compelling parallax and view-dependent effects as previous MPI methods, while simultaneously interpolating along changes in reflectance and illumination with time. We show how to learn a model of these effects in an unsupervised way from an unstructured collection of photos without temporal registration, demonstrating significant improvements over recent work in neural rendering.

The main ingredients of the new framework, called DEtection TRansformer or DETR, are a set-based global loss that forces unique predictions via bipartite matching, and a transformer encoder-decoder architecture. Given a fixed small set of learned object queries, DETR reasons about the relations of the objects and the global image context to directly output the final set of predictions in parallel. The new model is conceptually simple and does not require a specialized library, unlike many other modern detectors. DETR demonstrates accuracy and run-time performance on par with the well-established and highly-optimized Faster R-CNN baseline on the challenging COCO object detection dataset. Moreover, we show that DETR can be easily generalized to produce a competitive panoptic segmentation prediction in a unified manner",

In this work, we design a physical driven architecture, namely DeepSFM, inspired by traditional Bundle Adjustment (BA), which consists of two cost volume based architectures for depth and pose estimation respectively, iteratively running to improve both. The explicit constraints on both depth (structure) and pose (motion), when combined with the learning components, bring the merit from both traditional BA and emerging deep learning technology.

    "abstract": "Current multi-object tracking and segmentation (MOTS) methods follow the tracking-by-detection paradigm and adopt convolutions for feature extraction. However, as affected by the inherent receptive field, convolution based feature extraction inevitably mixes up the foreground features and the background features, resulting in ambiguities in the subsequent instance association. In this paper, we propose a highly effective method for learning instance embeddings based on segments by converting the compact image representation to un-ordered 2D point cloud representation. Our method generates a new tracking-by-points paradigm where discriminative instance embeddings are learned from randomly selected points rather than images. Furthermore, multiple informative data modalities are converted into point-wise representations to enrich point-wise features. The resulting online MOTS framework, named PointTrack, surpasses all the state-of-the-art methods including 3D tracking methods by large margins (5.4\\% higher MOTSA and 18 times faster over MOTSFusion) with the near real-time speed (22 FPS). Evaluations across three datasets demonstrate both the effectiveness and efficiency of our method.

CondInst enjoys two advantages: 1) Instance segmentation is solved by a fully convolutional network, eliminating the need for ROI cropping and feature alignment. 2) Due to the much improved capacity of dynamically-generated conditional convolutions, the mask head can be very compact (e.g., 3 conv. layers, each having only 8 channels), leading to significantly faster inference.

    "abstract": "Over the last years, visual localization and mapping solutions have been adopted by an increasing number of mixed reality and robotics systems. The recent trend towards cloud-based localization and mapping systems has raised significant privacy concerns. These are mainly grounded by the fact that these services require users to upload visual data to their servers, which can reveal potentially confidential information, even if only derived image features are uploaded. Recent research addresses some of these concerns for the task of image-based localization by concealing the geometry of the query images and database maps. The core idea of the approach is to lift 2D/3D feature points to random lines, while still providing sufficient constraints for camera pose estimation. In this paper, we further build upon this idea and propose solutions to the different core algorithms of an incremental Structure-from-Motion pipeline based on random line features. With this work, we make another fundamental step towards enabling privacy preserving cloud-based mapping solutions.

    "abstract": "A wide range of image captioning models has been developed, achieving significant improvement based on popular metrics, such as BLEU, CIDEr, and SPICE. However, although the generated captions can accurately describe the image, they are generic for similar images and lack distinctiveness, i.e., cannot properly describe the uniqueness of each image. In this paper, we aim to improve the distinctiveness of image captions through training with sets of similar images. First, we propose a distinctiveness metric --- between-set CIDEr (CIDErBtw) to evaluate the distinctiveness of a caption with respect to those of similar images. Our metric shows that the human annotations of each image are not equivalent based on distinctiveness. Thus we propose several new training strategies to encourage the distinctiveness of the generated caption for each image, which are based on using CIDErBtw in a weighted loss function or as a reinforcement learning reward. Finally, extensive experiments are conducted, showing that our proposed approach significantly improves both distinctiveness (as measured by CIDErBtw and retrieval metrics) and accuracy (e.g., as measured by CIDEr) for a wide variety of image captioning baselines. These results are further confirmed through a user study",

    "title": "Long-term Human Motion Prediction with Scene Context",
    "abstract": "Human movement is goal-directed and influenced by the spatial layout of the objects in the scene. To plan future human motion, it is crucial to perceive the environment -- imagine how hard it is to navigate a new room with lights off. Existing works on predicting human motion do not pay attention to the scene context and thus struggle in long-term prediction. In this work, we propose a novel three-stage framework that exploits scene context to tackle this task. Given a single scene image and 2D pose histories, our method first samples multiple human motion goals, then plans 3D human paths towards each goal, and finally predicts 3D human pose sequences following each path. For stable training and rigorous evaluation, we contribute a diverse synthetic dataset with clean annotations. In both synthetic and real datasets, our method shows consistent quantitative and qualitative improvements over existing methods",

    "abstract": "We present a method that achieves state-of-the-art results for synthesizing novel views of complex scenes by optimizing an underlying continuous volumetric scene function using a sparse set of input views. Our algorithm represents a scene using a fully-connected (non-convolutional) deep network, whose input is a single continuous 5D coordinate (spatial location $(x,y,z)$ and viewing direction $( heta,\\phi)$) and whose output is the volume density and view-dependent emitted radiance at that spatial location. We synthesize views by querying 5D coordinates along camera rays and use classic volume rendering techniques to project the output colors and densities into an image. Because volume rendering is naturally differentiable, the only input required to optimize our representation is a set of images with known camera poses. We describe how to effectively optimize neural radiance fields to render photorealistic novel views of scenes with complicated geometry and appearance, and demonstrate results that outperform prior work on neural rendering and view synthesis. View synthesis results are best viewed as videos, so we urge readers to view our supplementary video for convincing comparisons. We will make our code and data available upon publication",

    "abstract": "In this work we study the problem of using referential language to identify common objects in real-world 3D scenes. We focus on a challenging setup where the referred object belongs to a extit{fine-grained} object class and the underlying scene contains extit{multiple} object instances of that class. Due to the scarcity and unsuitability of existent 3D-oriented linguistic resources for this task, we first develop two large-scale and complementary visio-linguistic datasets: i) extbf{ extit{Sr3D}}, which contains 83.5K template-based utterances leveraging extit{spatial relations} with other fine-grained object classes to localize a referred object in a given scene, and ii) extbf{ extit{Nr3D}} which contains 41.5K extit{natural, free-form}, utterances collected by deploying a 2-player object reference game in 3D scenes. Using utterances of either datasets, human listeners can recognize the referred object with high ($>$86\\%, 92\\% resp.) accuracy. By tapping on this data, we develop novel neural listeners that can comprehend object-centric natural language and identify the referred object extit{directly} in a 3D scene. Our key technical contribution is designing an approach for combining linguistic and geometric information (in the form of 3D point-clouds) and creating multi-modal (3D) neural listeners. We also show that architectures which promote object-to-object communication via graph neural networks outperform less context-aware alternatives, and that language-assisted 3D object identification outperforms language-agnostic object classifiers",

Stereo 360 imagery can be captured from multi-camera systems for virtual reality (VR) rendering, but lacks motion parallax and correct-in-all-directions disparity cues. Together, these can quickly lead to VR sickness when viewing content. One solution is to try and generate a format suitable for 6DoF rendering, such as by estimating depth. However, this raises questions as to how to handle disoccluded regions in dynamic scenes. Our approach is to simultaneously learn depth and blending weights via a multi-sphere image representation, which can be rendered with correct 6DoF disparity and motion parallax in VR. This significantly improves comfort for the viewer, and can be inferred and rendered in real time on modern GPU hardware.

Each regional minimum is computed with a sequential quadratic programming scheme. These premises result in an algorithm that always determines the global minima of the perspective-n-point problem for any number of input correspondences, regardless of possible coplanar arrangements of the imaged 3D points.

    "abstract": "In silicon sensors, the interference between visible and near-infrared (NIR) signals is a crucial problem. For all-day video surveillance, commercial camera systems usually adopt auxiliary NIR cut filter and NIR LED illumination to selectively block or enhance NIR signal according to the surrounding light conditions. This switching between the daytime and the nighttime mode inevitably involves mechanical parts, and thus requires frequent maintenance. Furthermore, images captured at nighttime mode are in shortage of chrominance, which might hinder human interpretation and high-level computer vision algorithms in succession. In this paper, we present a deep learning based approach that directly generates human-friendly, visible color for video surveillance in a day. To enable training, we capture well-aligned video pairs through a customized optical device and contribute a large-scale dataset, video surveillance in a day (VSIAD).

    "abstract": "High-fidelity clothing reconstruction is the key to achieving photorealism in a wide range of applications including human digitization, virtual try-on, etc. Recent advances in learning-based approaches have accomplished unprecedented accuracy in recovering unclothed human shape and pose from single images, thanks to the availability of powerful statistical models, e.g. SMPL[38], learned from a large number of body scans. In contrast, modeling and recovering clothed human and 3D garments remains notoriously difficult, mostly due to the lack of large-scale clothing models available for the research community. We propose to fill this gap by introducing DeepFashion3D, the largest collection to date of 3D garment models, with the goal of establishing a novel benchmark and dataset for the evaluation of image-based garment reconstruction systems. Deep Fashion3D contains 2078 models reconstructed from real garments, which covers 10 different categories and 563 garment instances. It provides rich annotations including 3D feature lines, 3D body pose and the corresponded multi-view real images. In addition, each garment is randomly posed to enhance the variety of real clothing deformations. To demonstrate the advantage of \\datasetName{}, we propose a novel baseline approach for single-view garment reconstruction, which leverages the merits of both mesh and implicit representations. A novel adaptable template is proposed to enable the learning of all types of clothing in a single network. Extensive experiments have been conducted on the proposed dataset to verify its significance and usefulness. We will make Deep Fashion3D publicly available upon publication",

Towards reducing this superfluous computation, we propose to compute features only at sparsely sampled locations, which are probabilistically chosen according to activation responses, and then densely reconstruct the feature map with an efficient interpolation procedure. With this sampling-interpolation scheme, our network avoids expending computation on spatial locations that can be effectively interpolated, while being robust to activation prediction errors through broadly distributed sampling. A technical challenge of this sampling-based approach is that the binary decision variables for representing discrete sampling locations are non-differentiable, making them incompatible with backpropagation. To circumvent this issue, we make use of a reparameterization trick based on the Gumbel-Softmax distribution, with which backpropagation can iterate these variables towards binary values. The presented network is experimentally shown to save substantial computation while maintaining accuracy over a variety of computer vision tasks",

In this paper, We propose a simple and efficient operator called Border-Align to extract ``border features'' from the extreme point of the border to enhance the point feature.

VAT utilizes adversarial samples, generated by injecting perturbation in the input space, for training and thereby enhances the generalization ability of a classifier. However, such adversarial samples can be generated only within a very small area around the input data point, which limits the adversarial effectiveness of such samples. To address this problem we propose LVAT (Latent space VAT), which injects perturbation in the latent space instead of the input space. LVAT can generate adversarial samples flexibly, resulting in more adverse effect and thus more effective regularization. The latent space is built by a generative model, and in this paper we examine two type of models: variational auto-encoder and normalizing flow, specifically Glow. We evaluated the performance of our method in both supervised and semi-supervised learning scenarios for an image classification task using SVHN and CIFAR-10 datasets.

Based on only the few support samples in a meta-test task, our method generates the samples adversarial to the base few-shot classifier's boundaries and fine-tunes its embedding function in the direction that increases the classification margins of the adversarial samples. Consequently, the embedding space becomes denser around the labeled samples which makes the classifier robust to query samples.

Then we design a novel component-voting scheme to obtain an anchor code as the representative of the set of hash codes of objects with the target label, whose optimality guarantee is also theoretically derived. To balance the performance and perceptibility, we propose to minimize the Hamming distance between the hash code of the adversarial example and the anchor code under the $ll^\\infty$ restriction on the perturbation.

It has been shown that using the ﬁrst and second order statistics (e.g., mean and variance) to perform Z-score standardization on network activations or weight vectors, such as batch normalization (BN) and weight standardization (WS), can improve the training performance. Diﬀerent from those previous methods that mostly operate on activations or weights, we present a new optimization technique, namely gradient centralization (GC), which operates directly on gradients by centralizing the gradient vectors to have zero mean. GC can be viewed as a projected gradient descent method with a constrained loss function. We show that GC can regularize both the weight space and output feature space so that it can boost the generalization performance of DNNs. Moreover, GC improves the Lipschitzness of the loss function and its gradient so that the training process becomes more eﬃcient and stable. GC is very simple to implement and can be easily embedded into existing gradient based DNN optimizers with only one line of code. It can also be directly used to ﬁne-tune the pre-trained DNNs. Our experiments on various applications, including general image classiﬁcation, ﬁne-grained image classiﬁcation, detection and segmentation, demonstrate that GC can consistently improve the performance of DNN learning",

To overcome these problems, in this work we propose an unsupervised deep homography method with a new architecture design. In the spirit of the RANSAC procedure in traditional methods, we specifically learn an outlier mask to only select reliable regions for homography estimation. We calculate loss with respect to our learned deep features instead of directly comparing image content as did previously. To achieve the unsupervised training, we also formulate a novel triplet loss customized for our network.

Most existing methods either ignore how the camera wearer interacts with objects, or simply considers body motion as a separate modality. In contrast, we observe that the intentional hand movement reveals critical information about the future activity. Motivated by this observation, we adopt intentional hand movement as a feature representation, and propose a novel deep network that jointly models and predicts the egocentric hand motion, interaction hotspots and future action. Specifically, we consider the future hand motion as the motor attention, and model this attention using probabilistic variables in our deep model. The predicted motor attention is further used to select the discriminative spatial-temporal visual features for predicting actions and interaction hotspots. We present extensive experiments demonstrating the benefit of the proposed joint model.

Inspired by recent progress in monocular depth estimation, we generate plausible disparity maps from single images. In turn, we use those flawed disparity maps in a carefully designed pipeline to generate stereo training pairs. Training in this manner makes it possible to convert any collection of single RGB images into stereo training data. This results in a significant reduction in human effort, with no need to collect real depths or to hand-design synthetic data. We can consequently train a stereo matching network from scratch on datasets like COCO, which were previously hard to exploit for stereo.

In this paper, we figure out two key influencing factors of the process: the intra-class bias and the cross-class bias. We then propose a simple yet effective approach for prototype rectification in transductive setting. The approach utilizes label propagation to diminish the intra-class bias and feature shifting to diminish the cross-class bias. We also conduct theoretical analysis to derive its rationality as well as the lower bound of the performance. Effectiveness is shown on three few-shot benchmarks. Notably, our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on both miniImageNet (70.31% on 1-shot and 81.89% on 5-shot) and tieredImageNet (78.74% on 1-shot and 86.92% on 5-shot)",

    "title": "Learning Feature Descriptors using Camera Pose Supervision",
    "abstract": "Recent research on learned visual descriptors has shown promising improvements in correspondence estimation, a key component of many 3D vision tasks. However, existing descriptor learning frameworks typically require ground-truth correspondences between feature points for training, which are challenging to acquire at scale. In this paper we propose a novel weakly-supervised framework that can learn feature descriptors solely from relative camera poses between images. To do so, we devise both a new loss function that exploits the epipolar constraint given by camera poses, and a new model architecture that makes the whole pipeline differentiable and efficient. Because we no longer need pixel-level ground-truth correspondences, our framework opens up the possibility of training on much larger and more diverse datasets for better and unbiased descriptors. We call the resulting descriptors CAmera Pose Supervised, or CAPS, descriptors. Though trained with weak supervision, CAPS descriptors outperform even prior fully-supervised descriptors and achieve state-of-the-art performance on a variety of geometric tasks",

Furthermore, integrating our module to a common feature pyramid structure exhibits superior performance over other real-time methods even on light-weight backbone networks, such as ResNet-18.

Recent advances have shifted the interest towards directly regressing parameters of a parametric human model by supervising them on large-scale, images with 2D landmark annotations. This limits the generalizability of such approaches to operate on samples from unlabeled wild environments. Acknowledging this we propose a novel appearance consensus driven self-supervised objective. To effectively disentangle the foreground (FG) human we rely on image pairs depicting the same person (consistent FG) in varied pose and background (BG) which are obtained from unlabeled wild videos. The proposed FG appearance consistency objective makes use of a novel, differentiable extit{Color-recovery} module to obtain vertex colors without involving any trainable appearance extraction network; via efficient realization of color-picking and reflectional symmetry. We achieve state-of-the-art results on the standard model-based 3D pose estimation benchmarks at comparable supervision levels. Furthermore, the resulting colored mesh prediction opens up usage of our framework for a variety of appearance-related tasks beyond pose and shape estimation, thus establishing our superior generalizability",

Line imaging has several advantages over 2D sensors: high frame rate, high dynamic range, high fill-factor with additional on-chip computation, low-cost beyond the visible spectrum, and high energy efficiency when used with line illumination.

In this work, we propose a simple gated network (GateNet) to solve both issues at once. With the help of multilevel gate units, the valuable context information from the encoder can be optimally transmitted to the decoder. We design a novel gated dual branch structure to build the cooperation among different levels of features and improve the discriminability of the whole network. Through the dual branch design, more details of the saliency map can be further restored. In addition, we adopt the atrous spatial pyramid pooling based on the proposed “Fold” operation (Fold-ASPP) to accurately localize salient objects of various scales.

    "abstract": "Quantization plays an important role in the energy-efficient deployment of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) on resource-limited devices. Post-training quantization is highly desirable since it does not require retraining or access to the full training dataset. The well-established uniform scheme for post-training quantization achieves satisfactory results by converting DNNs from full-precision to 8-bit fixed-point integers. However, it suffers from significant performance degradation when quantizing to lower bit-widths. In this paper, we propose a PieceWise Linear Quantization (PWLQ) scheme to enable accurate approximation for tensor values that have bell-shaped distributions with long tails. Our approach breaks the entire quantization range into non-overlapping regions for each tensor, with each region being assigned an equal number of quantization levels. Optimal breakpoints that divide the entire range are found by minimizing the quantization error. Compared to state-of-the-art post-training quantization methods, experimental results show that our proposed method achieves superior performance on image classification, semantic segmentation, and object detection with minor overhead",

    "abstract": "Although a significant progress has been witnessed in supervised person re-identification (re-id), it remains challenging to generalize re-id models to new domains due to the huge domain gaps. Recently, there has been a growing interest in using unsupervised domain adaptation to address this scalability issue. Existing methods typically conduct adaptation on the representation space that contains both id-related and id-unrelated factors, thus inevitably undermining the adaptation efficacy of id-related features. In this paper, we seek to improve adaptation by purifying the representation space to be adapted. To this end, we propose a joint learning framework that disentangles id-related/unrelated features and enforces adaptation to work on the id-related feature space exclusively. Our model involves a disentangling module that encodes cross-domain images into a shared appearance space and two separate structure spaces, and an adaptation module that performs adversarial alignment and self-training on the shared appearance space. The two modules are co-designed to be mutually beneficial. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed joint learning framework outperforms the state-of-the-art methods by clear margins",

RF-Diary can further observe and caption people's life through walls and occlusions and in dark settings. In designing RF-Diary, we exploit the ability of radio signals to capture people's 3D dynamics, and use the floormap to help the model learn people's interactions with objects. We also use a multi-modal feature alignment training scheme that leverages existing video-based captioning datasets to improve the performance of our radio-based captioning model. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that RF-Diary generates accurate captions under visible conditions.

We introduce a simple training heuristic, Representation Self-Challenging (RSC), that significantly improves the generalization of CNN to the out-of-domain data. RSC iteratively challenges (discards) the dominant features activated on the training data, and forces the network to activate remaining features that correlate with labels. This process appears to activate feature representations applicable to out-of-domain data without prior knowledge of the new domain and without learning extra network parameters. We present the theoretical properties and conditions of RSC for improving cross-domain generalization.

    "abstract": "Recently, dynamic inference has emerged as a promising way to reduce the computational cost of deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs). In contrast to static methods (e.g., weight pruning), dynamic inference adaptively adjusts the inference process according to each input sample, which can considerably reduce the computational cost on \"\"easy\"\" samples while maintaining the overall model performance. In this paper, we introduce a general framework, S2DNAS, which can transform various static CNN models to support dynamic inference via neural architecture search. To this end, based on a given CNN model, we first generate a CNN architecture space in which each architecture is a multi-stage CNN generated from the given model using some predefined transformations. Then, we propose a reinforcement learning based approach to automatically search for the optimal CNN architecture in the generated space. At last, with the searched multi-stage network, we can perform dynamic inference by adaptively choosing a stage to evaluate for each sample. Unlike previous works that introduce irregular computations or complex controllers in the inference or re-design a CNN model from scratch, our method can generalize to most of the popular CNN architectures and the searched dynamic network can be directly deployed using existing deep learning frameworks in various hardware devices",

To handle complex or simple motion patterns globally, our frame-level scheme RaFC-frame automatically decides the optimal flow map resolution for each video frame. To cope different types of motion patterns locally, our block-level scheme called RaFC-block can also select the optimal resolution for each local block of motion features. In addition, the rate-distortion criterion is applied to both RaFC-frame and RaFC-block and select the optimal motion coding mode for effective flow coding.

While multi-view videos are not common, the videos of a celebrity performing a specific action are usually abundant on the Internet. Even if these videos were recorded at different time instances, they would encode the same motion characteristics of the person. Therefore, we propose to capture human motion by jointly analyzing these Internet videos instead of using single videos separately. However, this new task poses many new challenges that cannot be addressed by existing methods, as the videos are unsynchronized, the camera viewpoints are unknown, the background scenes are different, and the human motions are not exactly the same among videos.

With APM aligning the adjacent feature maps in pixel level, the following 3D convolution can model temporal information on the premise of maintaining the appearance representation quality. It is easy to combine AP3D with existing 3D ConvNets by simply replacing the original 3D convolution kernels with AP3Ds.

Fortunately it is a coupled problem: the pose can be found easily given the correspondences and vice versa. Existing approaches assume that noisy correspondences are provided, that a good pose prior is available, or that the problem size is small. We instead propose the first fully end-to-end trainable network for solving the blind PnP problem efficiently and globally, that is, without the need for pose priors.

    "abstract": "Learning a good image prior is a long-term goal for image restoration and manipulation. While existing methods like deep image prior (DIP) capture low-level image statistics, there are still gaps toward an image prior that captures rich image semantics including color, spatial coherence, textures, and high-level concepts. This work presents an effective way to exploit the image prior captured by a generative adversarial network (GAN) trained on large-scale natural images. As shown in Fig.1, the deep generative prior (DGP) provides compelling results to restore missing semantics, e.g., color, patch, resolution, of various degraded images. It also enables diverse image manipulation including random jittering, image morphing, and category transfer. Such highly flexible effects are made possible through relaxing the assumption of existing GAN-inversion methods, which tend to fix the generator. Notably, we allow the generator to be fine-tuned on-the-fly in a progressive manner regularized by feature distance obtained by the discriminator in GAN. We show that these easy-to-implement and practical changes help preserve the reconstruction to remain in the manifold of nature image, and thus lead to more precise and faithful reconstruction for real images.

    "abstract": "Coded aperture is a promising approach for capturing the 4-D light field (LF), in which the 4-D data are compressively modulated into 2-D coded measurements that are further decoded by reconstruction algorithms. The bottleneck lies in the reconstruction algorithms, resulting in rather limited reconstruction quality. To tackle this challenge, we propose a novel learning-based framework for the reconstruction of high-quality LFs from acquisitions via learned coded apertures. The proposed method incorporates the measurement observation into the deep learning framework elegantly to avoid relying entirely on data-driven priors for LF reconstruction. Specifically, we first formulate the compressive LF reconstruction as an inverse problem with an implicit regularization term. Then, we construct the regularization term with an efficient deep spatial-angular convolutional sub-network to comprehensively explore the signal distribution free from the limited representation ability and inefficiency of deterministic mathematical modeling. Experimental results show that the reconstructed LFs not only achieve much higher PSNR/SSIM but also preserve the LF parallax structure better, compared with state-of-the-art methods on both real and synthetic LF benchmarks. In addition, experiments show that our method is efficient and robust to noise, which is an essential advantage for a real camera system.

Since the amplitude of the physiological signals is usually very small, they can be easily affected by head movements, lighting conditions, and sensor diversities. To address these challenges, we propose a cross-verified feature disentangling strategy to disentangle the physiological features with non-physiological representations such as head movements and lighting conditions, and then use the distilled physiological features for robust multi-task physiological measurements. We first transform the input face videos into a multi-scale spatial-temporal map (MSTmap), which can suppress the irrelevant background and noise features while retaining most of the temporal characteristics of the periodic physiological signals. Then we take pairwise MSTmaps as inputs to an autoencoder architecture with two encoders (one for physiological signals and the other for non-physiological information) and use a cross-verified scheme to obtain physiological features disentangled with the non-physiological features. The disentangled features are finally used for the joint prediction of multiple physiological signals like average HR values and rPPG signals. Comprehensive experiments on different large-scale public datasets of multiple physiological measurement tasks as well as the cross-database testing demonstrate the robustness of our approach",

However, they can only produce static surfaces that are not controllable, which provides limited ability to modify the resulting model by editing its pose or shape parameters. Nevertheless, such features are essential in building flexible models for both computer graphics and computer vision. In this work, we present methodology that combines detail-rich implicit functions and parametric representations in order to reconstruct 3D models of people that remain controllable and accurate even in the presence of clothing. Given sparse 3D point clouds sampled on the surface of a dressed person, we use an Implicit Part Network (IP-Net) to jointly predict the outer 3D surface of the dressed person, the inner body surface, and the semantic correspondences to a parametric body model. We subsequently use correspondences to fit the body model to our inner surface and then non-rigidly deform it (under a parametric body + displacement model) to the outer surface in order to capture garment, face and hair detail. In quantitative and qualitative experiments with both full body data and hand scans we show that the proposed methodology generalizes, and is effective even given incomplete point clouds collected from single-view depth images. We will release our models and code",

    "abstract": "Vehicle re-identification (re-ID) focuses on matching images of the same vehicle across different cameras. It is fundamentally challenging because differences between vehicles are sometimes subtle. While several studies incorporate spatial-attention mechanisms to help vehicle re-ID, they often require expensive keypoint labels or suffer from noisy attention if not trained with expensive labels. In this work, we propose a dedicated Semantics-guided Part Attention Network (SPAN) to robustly predict part attention masks for different views of vehicles given only image-level semantic labels during training. With the help of part attention masks, we can extract discriminative features in each part separately. Then we introduce Co-occurrence Part-attentive Distance Metric (CPDM) which places greater emphasis on co-occurrence vehicle parts when evaluating the feature distance of two images.

    "title": "Mining Cross-Image Semantics for Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation",
    "abstract": "This paper studies the problem of learning semantic segmentation from image-level supervision only. Current popular solutions leverage object localization maps from classifiers as supervision signals, and struggle to make the localization maps capture more complete object content. Rather than previous efforts that primarily focus on intra-image information, we address the value of cross-image semantic relations for comprehensive object pattern mining. To achieve this, two neural co-attentions are incorporated into the classifier to complimentarily capture cross-image semantic similarities and differences. In particular, given a pair of training images, one co-attention enforces the classifier to recognize the common semantics from co-attentive objects, while the other one, called contrastive co-attention, drives the classifier to identify the unshared semantics from the rest, uncommon objects. This helps the classifier discover more object patterns and better ground semantics in image regions. In addition to boosting object pattern learning, the co-attention can leverage context from other related images to improve localization map inference, hence eventually benefiting semantic segmentation learning. More essentially, our algorithm provides a unified framework that handles well different WSSS settings, i.e., learning WSSS with (1) precise image-level supervision only, (2) extra simple single-label data, and (3) extra noisy web data. It sets new state-of-the-arts on all these settings, demonstrating well its efficacy and generalizability",

Furthermore, we adapt our model to address the harder task of reconstructing multiple objects from a single image. We reconstruct all objects jointly in one pass, producing a coherent reconstruction, where all objects live in a single consistent 3D coordinate frame relative to the camera and they do not intersect in 3D space. We also handle occlusions and resolve them by hallucinating the missing object parts in the 3D volume. We validate the impact of our contributions experimentally both on synthetic data from ShapeNet as well as real images from Pix3D. Our method improves over the state-of-the-art single-object methods on both datasets.

To this end, we propose layer-wise conditioning analysis, which explores the optimization landscape with respect to each layer independently. Such an analysis is theoretically supported under mild assumptions that approximately hold in practice. Based on our analysis, we show that batch normalization (BN) can stabilize the training, but sometimes result in the false impression of a local minimum, which has detrimental effects on the learning. Besides, we experimentally observe that BN can improve the layer-wise conditioning of the optimization problem. Finally, we find that the last linear layer of a very deep residual network displays ill-conditioned behavior. We solve this problem by only adding one BN layer before the last linear layer, which achieves improved performance over the original and pre-activation residual networks",

In this study, we firstly propose DeepHandMesh, a weakly-supervised deep encoder-decoder framework for high-fidelity hand mesh modeling. We design our system to be trained in an end-to-end and weakly-supervised manner; therefore, it does not require groundtruth meshes. Instead, it relies on weaker supervisions such as 3D joint coordinates and multi-view depth maps, which are easier to get than groundtruth meshes and do not dependent on the mesh topology. Although the proposed DeepHandMesh is trained in a weakly-supervised way, it provides significantly more realistic hand mesh than previous fully-supervised hand models. Our newly introduced penetration avoidance loss further improves results by replicating physical interaction between hand parts. Finally, we demonstrate that our system can also be applied successfully to the 3D hand mesh estimation from general images.

    "abstract": "Recently, learning based video compression methods attract increasing attention. However, previous works suffer from error propagation, which stems from the accumulation of reconstructed error in inter predictive coding. Meanwhile, previous learning based video codecs are also not adaptive to different video contents. To address these two problems, we propose a content adaptive and error propagation aware video compression system. Specifically, our method employs a joint training strategy by considering the compression performance of multiple consecutive frames instead of a single frame. Based on the learned long-term temporal information, our approach effectively alleviates error propagation in reconstructed frames. More importantly, instead of using the hand-crafted coding modes in the traditional compression systems, we design an online encoder updating scheme for the learned video compression. The proposed approach updates the parameters for encoder according to the rate-distortion criterion but keeps the decoder unchanged in the inference stage. Therefore, the encoder is adaptive to different video contents and achieves better compression efficiency by reducing the domain gap between the training and testing datasets. Our method is simple yet effective and outperforms the state-of-the-art learning based video codec on benchmark datasets without increasing the model size or decreasing the decoding speed",

    "title": "Towards Streaming Perception",
    "abstract": "Embodied perception refers to the ability of an autonomous agent to perceive its environment so that it can (re)act. The responsiveness of the agent is largely governed by latency of its processing pipeline. While past work has studied the algorithmic trade-off between latency and accuracy, there has not been a clear metric to compare different methods along the Pareto optimal latency-accuracy curve. We point out a discrepancy between standard offline evaluation and real-time applications: by the time an algorithm finishes processing a particular image frame, the surrounding world has changed. To these ends, we present an approach that coherently integrates latency and accuracy into a single metric for real-time online perception, which we refer to as \"\"streaming accuracy\"\". The key insight behind this metric is to jointly evaluate the output of the entire perception stack at every time instant, forcing the stack to consider the amount of streaming data that should be ignored while computation is occurring. More broadly, building upon this metric, we introduce a meta-benchmark that systematically converts any image understanding task into a streaming perception task. We focus on the illustrative tasks of object detection and instance segmentation in urban video streams, and contribute a novel dataset with high-quality and temporally-dense annotations. Our proposed solutions and their empirical analysis demonstrate a number of surprising conclusions: (1) there exists an optimal \"\"sweet spot\"\" that maximizes streaming accuracy along the Pareto optimal latency-accuracy curve, (2) asynchronous tracking and future forecasting naturally emerge as internal representations that enable streaming image understanding, and (3) dynamic scheduling can be used to overcome temporal aliasing, yielding the paradoxical result that latency is sometimes minimized by sitting idle and \"\"doing nothing\"\"",

We achieve this with a differentiable object synthesizer which can change an object’s appearance while retaining its pose. Constrained adversarial optimization of object appearance through this synthesizer produces rare/difficult versions of an object which fool the target object detector. Experiments show that our approach effectively synthesizes difficult test data, dropping the performance of YoloV3 detector by more than 20 mAP points by changing the appearance of a single object and discovering failure modes of the model. The generated semantic adversarial data can also be used to robustify the detector through data augmentation, consistently improving its performance in both standard and out-of-dataset-distribution test sets, across three different datasets",

Our formulation takes inspiration from the open-set recognition problem where test scenarios do not necessarily belong to the training distribution. We also discuss various quirks and assumptions encoded in recently proposed approaches for CL. We argue that some oversimplify the problem to an extent that leaves it with very little practical importance, and makes it extremely easy to perform well on. To validate this, we propose GDumb that (1) greedily stores samples in memory as they come and; (2) at test time, trains a model from scratch using samples only in the memory. We show that even though GDumb is not specifically designed for CL problems, it obtains state-of-the-art accuracies (often with large margins) in almost all the experiments when compared to a multitude of recently proposed algorithms. Surprisingly, it outperforms approaches in CL formulations for which they were specifically designed. This, we believe, raises concerns regarding our progress in CL for classification. Overall, we hope our formulation, characterizations and discussions will help in designing realistically useful CL algorithms, and GDumb will serve as a strong contender for the same",

    "abstract": "Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been successfully used in a range of tasks. However, CNNs are often viewed as \"\"black-box\"\" and lack of interpretability. One main reason is due to the filter-class entanglement -- an intricate many-to-many correspondence between filters and classes. Most existing works attempt post-hoc interpretation on a pre-trained model, while neglecting to reduce the entanglement underlying the model. In contrast, we focus on alleviating filter-class entanglement during training. Inspired by cellular differentiation, we propose a novel strategy to train interpretable CNNs by encouraging class-specific filters, among which each filter responds to only one (or few) class. Concretely, we design a learnable sparse Class-Specific Gate (CSG) structure to assign each filter with one (or few) class in a flexible way. The gate allows a filter's activation to pass only when the input samples come from the specific class. Extensive experiments demonstrate the fabulous performance of our method in generating a sparse and highly class-related representation of the input, which leads to stronger interpretability. Moreover, comparing with the standard training strategy, our model displays benefits in applications like object localization and adversarial sample detection.

    "abstract": "We present a learning-based method for interpolating and manipulating 3D shapes represented as point clouds, that is explicitly designed to preserve intrinsic shape properties. Our approach is based on constructing a dual encoding space that enables shape synthesis and, at the same time, provides links to the intrinsic shape metric, which is typically not available on point cloud data. Our method works in a single pass and avoids expensive optimization, employed by existing techniques. Furthermore, the strong regularization provided by our dual latent space approach also helps to improve shape recovery in challenging settings from noisy point clouds across datasets. Extensive experiments show that our method results in more realistic and smoother interpolations compared to baselines",

    "abstract": "In recent years we have witnessed tremendous progress in unpaired image-to-image translation, propelled by the emergence of DNNs and adversarial training strategies. However, most existing methods focus on transfer of style and appearance, rather than on shape translation. The latter task is challenging, due to its intricate non-local nature, which calls for additional supervision. We mitigate this by descending the deep layers of a pre-trained network, where the deep features contain more semantics, and applying the translation between these deep features. Our translation is performed in a cascaded, deep-to-shallow, fashion, along the deep feature hierarchy: we first translate between the deepest layers that encode the higher-level semantic content of the image, proceeding to translate the shallower layers, conditioned on the deeper ones. We further demonstrate the effectiveness of using pre-trained deep features in the context of unconditioned image generation",

    "abstract": "To be invariant, or not to be invariant: that is the question formulated in this work about local descriptors. A limitation of current feature descriptors is the trade-off between generalization and discriminative power: more invariance means less informative descriptors. We propose to overcome this limitation with a disentanglement of invariance in local descriptors and with an online selection of the most appropriate invariance given the context. Our framework consists in a joint learning of multiple local descriptors with different levels of invariance and of meta descriptors encoding the regional variations of an image. The similarity of these meta descriptors across images is used to select the right invariance when matching the local descriptors. Our approach, named Local Invariance Selection at Runtime for Descriptors (LISRD), enables descriptors to adapt to adverse changes in images, while remaining discriminative when invariance is not required. We demonstrate that our method can boost the performance of current descriptors and outperforms state-of-the-art descriptors in several matching tasks, when evaluated on challenging datasets with day-night illumination as well as viewpoint changes",

    "title": "Rethinking Image Inpainting via a Mutual Encoder-Decoder with Feature Equalizations",
    "abstract": "Deep encoder-decoder based CNNs have advanced image inpainting methods for hole filling. While existing methods recover structures and textures step-by-step in the hole regions, they typically use two encoder-decoders for separate recovery. The CNN features of each encoder are learned to capture either missing structures or textures without considering them as a whole. The insufficient utilization of these encoder features hampers the performance of recovering both structures and textures. In this paper, we propose a mutual encoder-decoder CNN for joint recovery of both. We use CNN features from the deep and shallow layers of the encoder to represent structures and textures of an input image, respectively. The deep layer features are sent to a structure branch, while the shallow layer features are sent to a texture branch. In each branch, we fill holes in multiple scales of the CNN features. The filled CNN features from both branches are concatenated and then equalized. During feature equalization, we reweigh channel attentions first and propose a bilateral propagation activation function to enable spatial equalization. To this end, the filled CNN features of structure and texture mutually benefit each other to represent image content at all feature levels. We then use the equalized feature to supplement decoder features for output image generation through skip connections. Experiments on benchmark datasets show that the proposed method is effective to recover structures and textures and performs favorably against state-of-the-art approaches",

The problem of how to capture and utilize this limited information to accurately segment the target remains a fundamental research question. We address this by introducing an end-to-end trainable VOS architecture that integrates a differentiable few-shot learner. Our learner is designed to predict a powerful parametric model of the target by minimizing a segmentation error in the first frame. We further go beyond the standard few-shot learning paradigm by learning what our target model should learn in order to maximize segmentation accuracy. We perform extensive experiments on standard benchmarks. Our approach sets a new state-of-the-art on the large-scale YouTube-VOS 2018 dataset by achieving an overall score of 81.5, corresponding to a 2.6% relative improvement over the previous best result.

This dataset includes the scans, registrations to the SMPL model, scans segmented in clothing parts, garment category and size labels.

    "abstract": "In this paper, we advocate the adoption of metric preservation as a powerful prior for learning latent representations of deformable 3D shapes. Key to our construction is the introduction of a geometric distortion criterion, defined directly on the decoded shapes, translating the preservation of the metric on the decoding to the formation of linear paths in the underlying latent space. Our rationale lies in the observation that training samples alone are often insufficient to endow generative models with high fidelity, motivating the need for large training datasets. In contrast, metric preservation provides a rigorous way to control the amount of geometric distortion incurring in the construction of the latent space, leading in turn to synthetic samples of higher quality. We further demonstrate, for the first time, the adoption of differentiable intrinsic distances in the backpropagation of a geodesic loss. Our geometric priors are particularly relevant in the presence of scarce training data, where learning any meaningful latent structure can be especially challenging. The effectiveness and potential of our generative model is showcased in applications of style transfer and content generation using triangle meshes and point clouds",

Existing works only deal with either style difference or spatial deformation alone, synthesizing photos from edge-aligned line drawings or transforming shapes within the same modality, e.g., color images. Our insight is to decompose the unsupervised sketch to photo synthesis task into two stages of translation: First shape translation from sketches to grayscale photos and then content enrichment from grayscale to color photos. We also incorporate a self-supervised denoising objective and an attention module to handle abstraction and style variations that are specific to sketches. Our synthesis is sketch-faithful and photo-realistic, enabling sketch-based image retrieval and automatic sketch generation that captures human visual perception beyond the edge map of a photo",

In this paper, we propose a method for 3D object completion and classification based on point clouds. We introduce a new way of organizing the extracted features based on their activations, which we name soft pooling. For the decoder stage, we propose regional convolutions, a novel operator aimed at maximizing the global activation entropy. Furthermore, inspired by the local refining procedure in Point Completion Network (PCN), we also propose a patch-deforming operation to simulate deconvolutional operations for point clouds. This paper proves that our regional activation can be incorporated in many point cloud architectures like AtlasNet and PCN, leading to better performance for geometric completion.

    "abstract": "Current age datasets lie in a long-tailed distribution, which brings difficulties to describe the aging mechanism for the imbalance ages. To alleviate it, we design a novel facial age prior to guide the aging mechanism modeling. To explore the age effects on facial images, we propose a Disentangled Adversarial Autoencoder (DAAE) to disentangle the facial images into three independent factors: age, identity and extraneous information. To avoid the \"\"wash away\"\" of age and identity information in face aging process, we propose a hierarchical conditional generator by passing the disentangled identity and age embeddings to the high-level and low-level layers with class-conditional BatchNorm. Finally, a disentangled adversarial learning mechanism is introduced to boost the image quality for face aging. In this way, when manipulating the age distribution, DAAE can achieve face aging with arbitrary ages. Further, given an input face image, the mean value of the learned age posterior distribution can be treated as an age estimator. These indicate that DAAE can efficiently and accurately estimate the age distribution by a disentangling manner. DAAE is the first attempt to achieve facial age analysis tasks, including face aging with arbitrary ages, exemplar-based face aging and age estimation, in an universal framework. The qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate the superiority of DAAE on five popular datasets, including CACD2000, Morph, UTKFace, FG-NET and AgeDB",

    "abstract": "Open set recognition requires a classifier to detect samples not belonging to any of the classes in its training set. Existing methods fit a probability distribution to the training samples on their embedding space and detect outliers according to this distribution. The embedding space is often obtained from a discriminative classifier. However, such discriminative representation focuses only on known classes, which may not be critical for distinguishing the unknown classes. We argue that the representation space should be jointly learned from the inlier classifier and the density estimator (served as an outlier detector). We propose the OpenHybrid framework, which is composed of an encoder to encode the input data into a joint embedding space, a classifier to classify samples to inlier classes, and a flow-based density estimator to detect whether a sample belongs to the unknown category. A typical problem of existing flow-based models is that they may assign a higher likelihood to outliers. However, we empirically observe that such an issue does not occur in our experiments when learning a joint representation for discriminative and generative components. Experiments on standard open set benchmarks also reveal that an end-to-end trained OpenHybrid model significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods and flow-based baselines",

By optimizing this loss, the generator produces images with the same structural topology as real images.

    "abstract": "With the knowledge of action moments (i.e., trimmed video clips that each contains an action instance), humans could routinely localize an action temporally in an untrimmed video. Nevertheless, most practical methods still require all training videos to be labeled with temporal annotations (action category and temporal boundary) and develop the models in a fully-supervised manner, despite expensive labeling efforts and inapplicable to new categories. In this paper, we introduce a new design of transfer learning type to learn action localization for a large set of action categories, but only on action moments from the categories of interest and temporal annotations of untrimmed videos from a small set of action classes. Specifically, we present Action Herald Networks (AherNet) that integrate such design into an one-stage action localization framework. Technically, a weight transfer function is uniquely devised to build the transformation between classification of action moments or foreground video segments and action localization in synthetic contextual moments or untrimmed videos. The context of each moment is learnt through the adversarial mechanism to differentiate the generated features from those of background in untrimmed videos. Extensive experiments are conducted on the learning both across the splits of ActivityNet v1.3 and from THUMOS14 to ActivityNet v1.3. Our AherNet demonstrates the superiority even comparing to most fully-supervised action localization methods. More remarkably, we train AherNet to localize actions from 600 categories on the leverage of action moments in Kinetics-600 and temporal annotations from 200 classes in ActivityNet v1.3",

    "abstract": "Training Binarized Neural Networks (BNNs) is challenging due to the discreteness. In order to efficiently optimize BNNs through backward propagations, real-valued auxiliary variables are commonly used to accumulate gradient updates. Those auxiliary variables are then directly quantized to binary weights in the forward pass, which brings about large quantization errors. In this paper, by introducing an appropriate proxy matrix, we reduce the weights quantization error while circumventing explicit binary regularizations on the full-precision auxiliary variables. Specifically, we regard pre-binarization weights as a linear combination of the basis vectors. The matrix composed of basis vectors is referred to as the proxy matrix, and auxiliary variables serve as the coefficients of this linear combination. We are the first to empirically identify and study the effectiveness of learning both basis and coefficients to construct the pre-binarization weights. This new proxy learning contributes to new leading performances on benchmark datasets",

    "abstract": "Remarkable progress has been made in 3D human pose estimation from a monocular RGB camera. However, only a few studies explored 3D multi-person cases. In this paper, we attempt to address the lack of a global perspective of the top-down approaches by introducing a novel form of supervision - Hierarchical Multi-person Ordinal Relations (HMOR). The HMOR encodes interaction information as the ordinal relations of depths and angles hierarchically, which captures the body-part and joint level semantic and maintains global consistency at the same time. In our approach, an integrated top-down model is designed to leverage these ordinal relations in the learning process. The integrated model estimates human bounding boxes, human depths, and root-relative 3D poses simultaneously, with a coarse-to-fine architecture to improve the accuracy of depth estimation. The proposed method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on publicly available multi-person 3D pose datasets (9.2 mm improvement on 3DPW dataset, 12.3 PCK improvement on MuPoTS-3D dataset, and 20.5 mm improvement on CMU Panoptic dataset). In addition to superior performance, our method costs lower computation complexity and fewer model parameters. Our code will be made publicly available",

We propose to leverage existing large-scale datasets of 3D models to understand the underlying 3D structure of objects seen in an image by constructing a CAD-based representation of the objects and their poses. We present Mask2CAD, which jointly detects objects in real-world images and for each detected object, optimizes for the most similar CAD model and its pose.We construct a joint embedding space between the detected regions of an image corresponding to an object and 3D CAD models, enabling retrieval of CAD models for an input RGB image. This produces a clean, lightweight representation of the objects in an image; this CAD-based representation ensures a valid, efficient shape representation for applications such as content creation or interactive scenarios, and makes a step towards understanding the transformation of real-world imagery to a synthetic domain.Experiments on real-world images from Pix3D demonstrate the advantage of our approach in comparison to state of the art.

Using this refactoring we generate differentiable approximations for each non-differentiable step through interpolation. Using UniLoss, we can optimize for different tasks and metrics using one unified framework, achieving comparable performance compared with task-specific losses.

Data augmentation by interpolation has shown to be a simple and effective approach in the image domain. Such a mixup is however not directly transferable to point clouds, as we do not have a one-to-one correspondence between the points of two different objects. In this paper, we define data augmentation between point clouds as a shortest path linear interpolation. To that end, we introduce PointMixup, an interpolation method that generates new examples through an optimal assignment of the path function between two point clouds. We prove that our PointMixup finds the shortest path between two point clouds and that the interpolation is assignment invariant and linear. With the definition of interpolation, PointMixup allows to introduce strong interpolation-based regularizers such as mixup and manifold mixup to the point cloud domain. Experimentally, we show the potential of PointMixup for point cloud classification, especially when examples are scarce, as well as increased robustness to noise and geometric transformations to points.

We design the cascaded clustering on feature maps to generate the pseudo-labels of human parts. Specifically, for the pixels of all images of a person, we first group them to foreground or background and then group the foreground pixels to human parts. The cluster assignments are subsequently used as pseudo-labels of human parts to supervise the part estimation and ISP iteratively learns the feature maps and groups them. Finally, local features of both human body parts and personal belongings are obtained according to the self-learned part estimation, and only features of visible parts are utilized for the retrieval. Extensive experiments on three widely used datasets validate the superiority of ISP over lots of state-of-the-art methods",

    "abstract": "Unsupervised image-to-image translation intends to learn a mapping of an image in a given domain to an analogous image in a different domain, without explicit supervision of the mapping. Few-shot unsupervised image-to-image translation further attempts to generalize the model to an unseen domain by leveraging example images of the unseen domain provided at inference time. While remarkably successful, existing few-shot image-to-image translation models find it difficult to preserve the structure of the input image while emulating the appearance of the unseen domain, which we refer to as the extit{content loss} problem. This is particularly severe when the poses of the objects in the input and example images are very different. To address the issue, we propose a new few-shot image translation model, COCO-FUNIT, which computes the style embedding of the example images conditioned on the input image and a new module called the constant style bias.

We demonstrate that these two stages are effective solutions for improving recall and precision, respectively, and they can be integrated into an end-to-end network. Our approach, dubbed Corner Proposal Network (CPN), enjoys the ability to detect objects of various scales and also avoids being confused by a large number of false-positive proposals. On the MS-COCO dataset, CPN achieves an AP of 49.2% which is competitive among state-of-the-art object detection methods.

    "title": "PhraseClick: Toward Achieving Flexible Interactive Segmentation by Phrase and Click",
    "abstract": "Existing interactive object segmentation methods mainly take spatial interactions such as bounding boxes or clicks as input. However, these interactions do not contain information about explicit attributes of the target-of-interest and thus cannot quickly specify what the selected object exactly is, especially when there are diverse scales of candidate objects or the target-of-interest contains multiple objects. Therefore, excessive user interactions are often required to reach desirable results. On the other hand, in existing approaches attribute information of objects is often not well utilized in interactive segmentation. We propose to employ phrase expressions as another interaction input to infer the attributes of target object. In this way, we can 1) leverage spatial clicks to locate the target object and 2) utilize semantic phrases to qualify the attributes of the target object. Specifically, the phrase expressions focus on ``what\"\" the target object is and the spatial clicks are in charge of ``where\"\" the target object is, which together help to accurately segment the target-of-interest with smaller number of interactions. Moreover, the proposed approach is flexible in terms of interaction modes and can efficiently handle complex scenarios by leveraging the strengths of each type of input. Our multi-modal phrase+click approach achieves new state-of-the-art performance on interactive segmentation. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to leverage both clicks and phrases for interactive segmentation",

We develop an attentive MMIL pooling method to adaptively explore useful audio and visual content from different temporal extent and modalities. Furthermore, we discover and mitigate modality bias and noisy label issues with an individual-guided learning mechanism and label smoothing technique, respectively. Experimental results show that the challenging audio-visual video parsing can be achieved even with only video-level weak labels.

The sample can be classified to known or unknown by the otherness with reciprocal points. To tackle the open set problem, we offer a novel open space risk regularization term. Based on the bounded space constructed by reciprocal points, the risk of unknown is reduced through multi-category interaction. The novel learning framework called Reciprocal Point Learning (RPL), which can indirectly introduce the unknown information into the learner with only known classes, so as to learn more compact and discriminative representations.

While demonstrating promising results, most implicit approaches are limited to comparably simple geometry of single objects and do not scale to more complicated or large-scale scenes. The key limiting factor of implicit methods is their simple fully-connected network architecture which does not allow for integrating local information in the observations or incorporating inductive biases such as translational equivariance. In this paper, we propose Convolutional Occupancy Networks, a more flexible implicit representation for detailed reconstruction of objects and 3D scenes. By combining convolutional encoders with implicit occupancy decoders, our model incorporates inductive biases, enabling structured reasoning in 3D space. We investigate the effectiveness of the proposed representation by reconstructing complex geometry from noisy point clouds and low-resolution voxel representations.

The second is the lack of robustness from the naive formulation of the problem as a least squares minimization. In this paper, we depart from the multi-person 3D pose estimation formulation, and instead reformulate it as crowd pose estimation.

The finding that pre-training a network on a rich source set (g, ImageNet) can help boost performance once fine-tuned on a usually much smaller target set, has been instrumental to many applications in language and vision. Yet, very little is known about its usefulness in 3D point cloud understanding. We see this as an opportunity considering the effort required for annotating data in 3D. In this work, we aim at facilitating research on 3D representation learning. Different from previous works, we focus on high-level scene understanding tasks. To this end, we select a suit of diverse datasets and tasks to measure the effect of unsupervised pre-training on a large source set of 3D scenes. Our findings are extremely encouraging: using a unified triplet of architecture, source dataset, and contrastive loss for pre-training, we achieve improvement over recent best results in segmentation and detection across 6 different benchmarks for indoor and outdoor, real and synthetic datasets -- demonstrating that the learned representation can generalize across domains. Furthermore, the improvement was similar to supervised pre-training, suggesting that future efforts should favor scaling data collection over more detailed annotation. We hope these findings will encourage more research on unsupervised pretext task design for 3D deep learning",

    "abstract": "Budgeted pruning is the problem of pruning under resource constraints. In budgeted pruning, how to distribute the resources across layers (i.e., sparsity allocation) is the key problem. Traditional methods solve it by discretely searching for the layer-wise pruning ratios, which lacks efficiency. In this paper, we propose Differentiable Sparsity Allocation (DSA), an efficient end-to-end budgeted pruning flow. Utilizing a novel differentiable pruning process, DSA finds the layer-wise pruning ratios with gradient-based optimization. It allocates sparsity in continuous space, which is more efficient than methods based on discrete evaluation and search. Furthermore, DSA could work in a pruning-from-scratch manner, whereas traditional budgeted pruning methods are applied to pre-trained models. Experimental results on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet show that DSA could achieve superior performance than current iterative budgeted pruning methods, and shorten the time cost of the overall pruning process by at least 1.5x in the meantime",

    "abstract": "AutoAugment has been a powerful algorithm that improves the accuracy of many vision tasks, yet it is sensitive to the operator space as well as hyper-parameters, and an improper setting may degenerate network optimization. This paper delves deep into the working mechanism, and reveals that AutoAugment may remove part of discriminative information from the training image and so insisting on the ground-truth label is no longer the best option. To relieve the inaccuracy of supervision, we make use of knowledge distillation that refers to the output of a teacher model to guide network training. Experiments are performed in standard image classification benchmarks, and demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in suppressing noise of data augmentation and stabilizing training. Upon the cooperation of knowledge distillation and AutoAugment, we claim the new state-of-the-art on ImageNet classification with a top-1 accuracy of 85.7%",

    "abstract": "In this work, we propose an efficient and accurate monocular 3D detection framework in single shot. Most successful 3D detectors take the projection constraint from the 3D bounding box to the 2D box as an important component. Four edges of a 2D box provide only four constraints and the performance deteriorates dramatically with the small error of the 2D detector. Different from these approaches, our method predicts the nine perspective keypoints of a 3D bounding box in image space, and then utilize the geometric relationship of 3D and 2D perspectives to recover the dimension, location, and orientation in 3D space. In this method, the properties of the object can be predicted stably even when the estimation of keypoints is very noisy, which enables us to obtain fast detection speed with a small architecture. Training our method only uses the 3D properties of the object without any extra annotations, category-specific 3D shape priors, or depth maps. Our method is the first real-time system (FPS>24) for monocular image 3D detection while achieves state-of-the-art performance on the KITTI benchmark",

    "title": "Video Object Segmentation with Episodic Graph Memory Networks",
    "abstract": "How to make a segmentation model efficiently adapt to a specific video as well as online target appearance variations is a fun- damental issue in the field of video object segmentation. In this work, a graph memory network is developed to address the novel idea of “learning to update the segmentation model”. Specifically, we exploit an episodic memory network, organized as a fully connected graph, to store frames as nodes and capture cross-frame correlations by edges. Further, learnable controllers are embedded to ease memory reading and writing, as well as maintain a fixed memory scale. The structured, external memory design enables our model to comprehensively mine and quickly store new knowl- edge, even with limited visual information, and the differentiable memory controllers slowly learn an abstract method for storing useful represen- tations in the memory and how to later use these representations for prediction, via gradient descent. In addition, the proposed graph mem- ory network yields a neat yet principled framework, which can generalize well to both one-shot and zero-shot video object segmentation tasks. Ex- tensive experiments on four challenging benchmark datasets verify that our graph memory network is able to facilitate the adaptation of the segmentation network for case-by-case video object segmentation",

    "title": "Rethinking Bottleneck Structure for Efficient Mobile Network Design",
    "abstract": "The inverted residual block is dominating architecture design for mobile networks recently. It changes the classic residual bottleneck by introducing two design rules: learning inverted residuals and using linear bottlenecks. In this paper, we rethink the necessity of such design change and find it may bring risks of information loss and gradient confusion. We thus propose to flip the structure and present a novel bottleneck design, called sandglass block, that performs identity mapping and spatial transformation at higher dimensions and thus alleviates information loss and gradient confusion effectively. Extensively experiments demonstrate that, different from the common belief, such bottleneck structure is indeed more beneficial than the inverted ones for mobile networks. In ImageNet classification, by simply replacing the inverted residual block with sandglass block, without increasing parameters and computations, the classification accuracy can be improved by more than 1.7% over MobileNetV2. On Pascal VOC 2007 test set, we observe that there is also 0.9% mAP improvement in object detection. We further verify the effectiveness of sandglass block by adding it into the search space of neural architecture search method DARTS. With 25% parameter reduction, the classification accuracy is improved by 0.13% over previous DARTS models. Code will be made publicly available",

    "title": "Side-Tuning: A Baseline for Network Adaptation via Additive Side Networks",
    "abstract": "When training a neural network for a desired task, one may prefer to adapt a pre-trained network rather than starting from randomly initialized weights. Adaptation can be useful in cases when training data is scarce, when a single learner needs to perform multiple tasks, or when one wishes to encode priors in the network. The most commonly employed approaches for network adaptation are fine-tuning and using the pre-trained network as a fixed feature extractor, among others.  In this paper, we propose a straightforward alternative: side-tuning. Side-tuning adapts a pre-trained network by training a lightweight \"\"side\"\" network that is fused with the (unchanged) pre-trained network via summation. This simple method works as well as or better than existing solutions and it resolves some of the basic issues with fine-tuning, fixed features, and other common approaches. In particular, side-tuning is less prone to overfitting, is asymptotically consistent, and does not suffer from catastrophic forgetting in incremental learning. We demonstrate the performance of side-tuning under a diverse set of scenarios, including incremental learning (iCIFAR, iTaskonomy), reinforcement learning, imitation learning (visual navigation in Habitat), NLP question-answering (SQuAD v2), and single-task transfer learning (Taskonomy), with consistently promising results",

    "abstract": "Machine learning models are known to perpetuate and even amplify the biases present in the data. However, these data biases frequently do not become apparent until after the models are deployed. To tackle this issue and to enable the preemptive analysis of large-scale dataset, we present our tool. REVISE (REvealing VIsual biaSEs) is a tool that assists in the investigation of a visual dataset, surfacing potential biases currently along three dimensions: (1) object-based, (2) gender-based, and (3) geography-based. Object-based biases relate to size, context, or diversity of object representation. Gender-based metrics aim to reveal the stereotypical portrayal of people of different genders. Geography-based analyses consider the representation of different geographic locations. REVISE sheds light on the dataset along these dimensions; the responsibility then lies with the user to consider the cultural and historical context, and to determine which of the revealed biases may be problematic. The tool then further assists the user by suggesting actionable steps that may be taken to mitigate the revealed biases. Overall, the key aim of our work is to tackle the machine learning bias problem early in the pipeline. REVISE is available at https://github.com/princetonvisualai/revise-tool",

A key idea is to construct effective negative captions for learning through language model guided word substitutions.

The proposed network exploits joint-aware features that are crucial for both tasks, with which gesture recognition and 3D hand pose estimation boost each other to learn highly discriminative features and models. In addition, a novel multi-order feature analysis method is introduced which learns posture and multi-order motion information from the intermediate feature maps of videos effectively and efficiently. Due to the exploitation of joint-aware features in common, the proposed technique is capable of learning gesture recognition and 3D hand pose estimation even when only gesture or pose labels are available, and this enables weakly supervised network learning with much reduced data labeling efforts. Extensive experiments show that our proposed method achieves superior gesture recognition and 3D hand pose estimation performance as compared with the state-of-the-art.

However, in many real-world scenarios of face recognition, the training dataset is limited in depth, $ extit{i.e.}$ only two face images are available for each ID. $ extit{We define this situation as Shallow Face Learning, and find it problematic with existing training methods.}$ Unlike deep face data, the shallow face data lacks intra-class diversity. As such, it can lead to collapse of feature dimension and consequently the learned network can easily suffer from degeneration and over-fitting in the collapsed dimension. In this paper, we aim to address the problem by introducing a novel training method named Semi-Siamese Training (SST). A pair of Semi-Siamese networks constitute the forward propagation structure, and the training loss is computed with an updating gallery queue, conducting effective optimization on shallow training data. Our method is developed without extra-dependency, thus can be flexibly integrated with the existing loss functions and network architectures. Extensive experiments on various benchmarks of face recognition show the proposed method significantly improves the training, not only in shallow face learning, but also for conventional deep face data",

    "abstract": "Generative adversarial networks (GANs) have gained increasing popularity in various computer vision applications, and recently start to be deployed to resource-constrained mobile devices. Similar to other deep models, state-of-the-art GANs also suffer from high parameter complexities. That has recently motivated the exploration of compressing GANs (usually generators). Compared to the vast literature and prevailing success in compressing deep classifiers, the study of GAN compression remains in its infancy, so far leveraging individual compression techniques instead of more sophisticated combinations. We observe that due to the notorious instability of training GANs, heuristically stacking different compression techniques will result in unsatisfactory results. To this end, we propose the first end-to-end optimization framework combining multiple compression means for GAN compression, dubbed GAN Slimming (GS). GS seamlessly integrates three mainstream compression techniques: model distillation, channel pruning and quantization, together with the GAN minimax objective, into one unified optimization form, that can be efficiently optimized from end to end. Without bells and whistles, GS largely outperforms existing options in compressing image-to-image translation GANs. Specifically, we apply GS to compress CartoonGAN, a state-of-the-art style transfer network, by up to $47 imes$ times, with minimal visual quality degradation.

In this paper, we investigate the problem of reducing the overall computation cost yet maintaining the high accuracy for 3D hand pose estimation from video sequences. A novel model, called Adaptive Computationally Efficient (ACE) network, is proposed, which takes advantage of a Gaussian kernel based Gate Module to dynamically switch the computation between a light model and a heavy network for feature extraction. Our model employs the light model to compute efficient features for most of the frames and invokes the heavy model only when necessary.

    "title": "Hamiltonian Dynamics for Real-World Shape Interpolation",
    "abstract": "We revisit the classical problem of 3D shape interpolation and propose a novel, physically plausible approach based on Hamiltonian dynamics. While most prior work focuses on synthetic input shapes, our formulation is designed to be applicable to real-world scans with imperfect input correspondences and various types of noise. To that end, we use recent progress on dynamic thin shell simulation and divergence-free shape deformation and combine them to address the inverse problem of finding a plausible intermediate sequence for two input shapes. In comparison to prior work that mainly focuses on small distortion of consecutive frames, we explicitly model volume preservation and momentum conservation, as well as an anisotropic local distortion model. We argue that, in order to get a robust interpolation for imperfect inputs, we need to model the input noise explicitly which results in an alignment based formulation. Finally, we show a qualitative and quantitative improvement over prior work on a broad range of synthetic and scanned data. Besides being more robust to noisy inputs, our method yields exactly volume preserving intermediate shapes, avoids self-intersections and is scalable to high resolution scans",

    "abstract": "Current multilingual vision-language models either require a large number of additional parameters for each supported language, or suffer performance degradation as languages are added. In this paper, we propose a Scalable Multilingual Aligned Language Representation (SMALR) that supports many languages with few model parameters without sacrificing downstream task performance. SMALR learns a fixed size language-agnostic representation for most words in a multilingual vocabulary, keeping language-specific features for just a few. We use a masked cross-language modeling loss to align features with context from other languages. Additionally, we propose a cross-lingual consistency module that ensures predictions made for a query and its machine translation are comparable. The effectiveness of SMALR is demonstrated with ten diverse languages, over twice the number supported in vision-language tasks to date. We evaluate on multilingual image-sentence retrieval and outperform prior work by 3-4% with less than 1/5th the training parameters compared to other word embedding methods",

Most of the existing methods for this caption-to-video retrieval problem do not fully exploit cross-modal cues present in video. Furthermore, they aggregate per-frame visual features with limited or no temporal information. In this paper, we present a multi-modal transformer to jointly encode the different modalities in video, which allows each of them to attend to the others. The transformer architecture is also leveraged to encode and model the temporal information. On the natural language side, we investigate the best practices to jointly optimize the language embedding together with the multi-modal transformer. This novel framework allows us to establish state-of-the-art results for video retrieval on three datasets. More details are available at http://thoth.inrialpes.fr/research/MMT",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we are aiming for a general reference-based super-resolution setting: it does not require the low-resolution image and the high-resolution reference image to be well aligned or with a similar texture. Instead, we only intend to transfer the relevant textures from reference images to the output super-resolution image. To this end, we engaged neural texture transfer to swap texture features between the low-resolution image and the high-resolution reference image. We identify the importance of designing a super-resolution task-specific features rather than classification oriented features for neural texture transfer, making the feature extractor more compatible with the image synthesis task. We develop an end-to-end training framework for the reference-based super-resolution task, where the feature encoding network prior to matching and swapping is jointly trained with the image synthesis network. We also discover that learning the high-frequency residual is an effective way for the reference-based super-resolution task. Without bells and whistles, the proposed method E2ENT2 achieved better performance than state-of-the method (i.e., SRNTT with five loss functions) with only two basic loss functions. Extensive experimental results on several datasets demonstrate that the proposed method E2ENT2 can achieve superior performance to existing best models both quantitatively and qualitatively",

To break the orchestrated self-scanning constraint, we propose a data-driven model completion scheme to generate a complete and fine-detailed initial model using only the front-view input. To enable robust tracking, we embrace both the initial model and the various visual cues into a novel performance capture scheme with hybrid motion optimization and semantic volumetric fusion, which can successfully capture challenging human motions under the monocular setting without pre-scanned detailed template and owns the reinitialization ability to recover from tracking failures and the disappear-reoccur scenarios.

    "abstract": "In this paper, we present a spatial rectifier to estimate surface normals of tilted images. Tilted images are of particular interest as more visual data are captured by arbitrarily oriented sensors such as body-/robot-mounted cameras. Existing approaches exhibit bounded performance on predicting surface normals because they were trained using gravity-aligned images. Our two main hypotheses are: (1) visual scene layout is indicative of the gravity direction; and (2) not all surfaces are equally represented by a learned estimator due to the structured distribution of the training data, i.e., there exists a transformation for each tilted image that is more responsive to the learned estimator than others. We design a spatial rectifier that is learned to transform the surface normal distribution of a tilted image to the rectified one that matches the gravity-aligned training data distribution. Along with the spatial rectifier, we propose a novel truncated angular loss that offers a stronger gradient at small angular errors and robustness to outliers. The resulting estimator outperforms the state-of-the-art methods including data augmentation baselines not only on ScanNet and NYUv2 but also on a new dataset called Tilt-RGBD that includes considerable roll and pitch camera motion",

These methods, however, only complete the partial shape with a single output, ignoring the ambiguity when reasoning the missing geometry. Hence, we pose a multi-modal shape completion problem, in which we seek to complete the partial shape with multiple outputs by learning a one-to-many mapping. We develop the first multimodal shape completion method that completes the partial shape via conditional generative modeling, without requiring paired training data. Our approach distills the ambiguity by conditioning the completion on a learned multimodal distribution of possible results. We extensively evaluate the approach on several datasets that contain varying forms of shape incompleteness, and compare among several baseline methods and variants of our methods qualitatively and quantitatively, demonstrating the merit of our method in completing partial shapes with both diversity and quality",

    "abstract": "3D object detection has been widely studied due to its potential applicability to many promising areas such as robotics and augmented reality. Yet, the sparse nature of the 3D data poses unique challenges to this task. Most notably, the observable surface of the 3D point clouds is disjoint from the center of the instance to ground the bounding box prediction on. To this end, we propose Generative Sparse Detection Network (GSDN), a fully-convolutional single-shot sparse detection network that efficiently generates the support for object proposals. The key component of our model is a generative sparse tensor decoder, which uses a series of transposed convolutions and pruning layers to expand the support of sparse tensors while discarding unlikely object centers to maintain minimal runtime and memory footprint. GSDN can process unprecedentedly large-scale inputs with a single fully-convolutional feed-forward pass, thus does not require the heuristic post-processing stage that stitches results from sliding windows as other previous methods have. We validate our approach on three 3D indoor datasets including the large-scale 3D indoor reconstruction dataset where our method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods by a relative improvement of 7.14% while being 3.78 times faster than the best prior work",

GSR presents important technical challenges: identifying semantic saliency, categorizing and localizing a large and diverse set of entities, overcoming semantic sparsity, and disambiguating roles. Moreover, unlike in captioning, GSR is straightforward to evaluate. To study this new task we create the Situations With Groundings (SWiG) dataset which adds 278,336 bounding-box groundings to the 11,538 entity classes in the imsitu dataset. We propose a Joint Situation Localizer and find that jointly predicting situations and groundings with end-to-end training handily outperforms independent training with late fusion on the entire grounding metric suite with relative gains between 8% and 32%. Finally, we show initial findings on three exciting future directions enabled by our models: conditional querying, visual chaining, and grounded semantic aware image retrieval.

Recent techniques leverage the multimodal nature of videos by using off-the-shelf features to represent videos, but interactions between modalities are rarely explored. Inspired by the fact that there exist cross-modal interactions in the human brain, we propose a novel method for learning pairwise modality interactions in order to better exploit complementary information for each pair of modalities in videos and thus improve performances on both tasks. We model modality interaction in both the sequence and channel levels in a pairwise fashion, and the pairwise interaction also provides some explainability for the predictions of target tasks. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method and validate specific design choices through extensive ablation studies. Our method turns out to achieve state-of-the-art performances on four standard benchmark datasets: MSVD and MSR-VTT (event captioning task), and Charades-STA and ActivityNet Captions (temporal sentence localization task)",

    "abstract": "We investigate the task of learning blind image denoising networks from an unpaired set of clean and noisy images. Such problem setting generally is practical and valuable considering that it is feasible to collect unpaired noisy and clean images in most real-world applications. And we further assume that the noise can be signal dependent but is spatially uncorrelated. In order to facilitate unpaired learning of denoising network, this paper presents a two-stage scheme by incorporating self-supervised learning and knowledge distillation. For self-supervised learning, we suggest a dilated blind-spot network (D-BSN) to learn denoising solely from real noisy images. Due to the spatial independence of noise, we adopt a network by stacking $1 imes1$ convolution layers to estimate the noise level map for each image. Both the D-BSN and image-specific noise model ($ ext{CNN}_{ ext{est}}$) can be jointly trained via maximizing the constrained log-likelihood. Given the output of D-BSN and estimated noise level map, improved denoising performance can be further obtained based on the Bayes' rule. As for knowledge distillation, we first apply the learned noise models to clean images to synthesize a paired set of training images, and use the real noisy images and the corresponding denoising results in the first stage to form another paired set. Then, the ultimate denoising model can be distilled by training an existing denoising network using these two paired sets. Experiments show that our unpaired learning method performs favorably on both synthetic noisy images and real-world noisy photographs in terms of quantitative and qualitative evaluation.

    "abstract": "The task of large-scale retrieval-based image localization is to estimate the geographical location of a query image by recognizing its nearest reference images from a city-scale dataset. However, the general public benchmarks only provide noisy GPS labels associated with the training images, which act as weak supervisions for learning image-to-image similarities. Such label noise prevents deep neural networks from learning discriminative features for accurate localization. To tackle this challenge, we propose to self-supervise image-to-region similarities in order to fully explore the potential of difficult positive images alongside their sub-regions. The estimated image-to-region similarities can serve as extra training supervision for improving the network in generations, which could in turn gradually refine the fine-grained similarities to achieve optimal performance. Our proposed self-enhanced image-to-region similarity labels effectively deal with the training bottleneck in the state-of-the-art pipelines without any additional parameters or manual annotations in both training and inference. Our method outperforms state-of-the-arts on the standard localization benchmarks by noticeable margins and shows excellent generalization capability on multiple image retrieval datasets",

    "abstract": "Novel view video synthesis aims to synthesize novel viewpoints videos given input captures of a human performance taken from multiple reference viewpoints and over consecutive time steps. Despite great advances in model-free novel view synthesis, existing methods present three limitations when applied to complex and time-varying human performance. First, these methods (and related datasets) mainly consider simple and symmetric objects. Second, they do not enforce explicit consistency across generated views. Third, they focus on static and non-moving objects. The fine-grained details of a human subject can therefore suffer from inconsistencies when synthesized across different viewpoints or time steps. To tackle these challenges, we introduce a human-specific framework that employs a learned 3D-aware representation. Specifically, we first introduce a novel siamese network that employs a gating layer for better reconstruction of the latent volumetric representation and, consequently, final visual results. Moreover, features from consecutive time steps are shared inside the network to improve temporal consistency. Second, we introduce a novel loss to explicitly enforce consistency across generated views both in space and in time. Third, we present the Multi-View Human Action (MVHA) dataset, consisting of near 1200 synthetic human performance captured from 54 viewpoints.

    "abstract": "Current object detection frameworks mainly rely on bounding box regression to localize objects. Despite the remarkable progress in recent years, the precision of bounding box regression remains unsatisfactory, hence limiting performance in object detection. We observe that precise localization requires careful placement of each side of the bounding box. However, the mainstream approach, which focuses on predicting centers and sizes, is not the most effective way to accomplish this task, especially when there exists displacements with large variance between the anchors and the targets. In this paper, we propose an alternative approach, named as Side-Aware Boundary Localization (SABL), where each side of the bounding box is respectively localized with a dedicated network branch. To tackle the difficulty of precise localization in the presence of displacements with large variance, we further propose a two-step localization scheme, which first predicts a range of movement through bucket prediction and then pinpoints the precise position within the predicted bucket. We test the proposed method on both two-stage and single-stage detection frameworks. Replacing the standard bounding box regression branch with the proposed design leads to significant improvements on Faster R-CNN, RetinaNet, and Cascade R-CNN, by 3.0%, 1.7%, and 0.9%, respectively.

To obtain the single-frame supervision, the annotators are asked to identify only a single frame within the temporal window of an action. This can significantly reduce the labor cost of obtaining full supervision which requires annotating the action boundary. Compared to the weak supervision that only annotates the video-level label, the single-frame supervision introduces extra temporal action signals while maintaining low annotation overhead. To make full use of such single-frame supervision, we propose a unified system called SF-Net. First, we propose to predict an actionness score for each video frame. Along with a typical category score, the actionness score can provide comprehensive information about the occurrence of a potential action and aid the temporal boundary refinement during inference. Second, we mine pseudo action and background frames based on the single-frame annotations. We identify pseudo action frames by adaptively expanding each annotated single frame to its nearby, contextual frames and we mine pseudo background frames from all the unannotated frames across multiple videos. Together with the ground-truth labeled frames, these pseudo-labeled frames are further used for training the classifier",

In contrast to common belief, we show that tasks with high affinity at a certain scale are not guaranteed to retain this behaviour at other scales, and vice versa. We propose a novel architecture, namely MTI-Net, that builds upon this finding in three ways. First, it explicitly models task interactions at every scale via a multi-scale multi-modal distillation unit. Second, it propagates distilled task information from lower to higher scales via a feature propagation module. Third, it aggregates the refined task features from all scales via a feature aggregation unit to produce the final per-task predictions.Extensive experiments on two multi-task dense labeling datasets show that, unlike prior work, our multi-task model delivers on the full potential of multi-task learning, that is, smaller memory footprint, reduced number of calculations, and better performance w.r.t. single-task learning. The code is made publicly available",

    "title": "Learning to Factorize and Relight a City",
    "abstract": "We propose a learning-based framework for disentangling outdoor scenes into temporally-varying illumination and permanent scene factors. Inspired by the classic intrinsic image decomposition, our learning signal builds upon two insights: 1) combining the disentangled factors should reconstruct the original image, and 2) the permanent factors should stay constant across multiple temporal samples of the same scene. To facilitate training, we assemble a city-scale dataset of outdoor timelapse imagery from Google Street View, where the same locations are captured repeatedly through time. This data represents an unprecedented scale of spatio-temporal outdoor imagery. We show that our learned disentangled factors can be used to manipulate novel images in realistic ways, such as changing lighting effects and scene geometry.

    "abstract": "Most of the existing Zero-Shot Learning (ZSL) approaches learn direct embeddings from global features or image parts (regions) to the semantic space, which, however, fail to capture the appearance relationships between different local regions within a single image. In this paper, to model the relations among local image regions, we incorporate the region-based relation reasoning into ZSL. Our method, termed as Region Graph Embedding Network (RGEN), is trained end-to-end from raw image data. Specifically, RGEN consists of two branches: the Constrained Part Attention (CPA) branch and the Parts Relation Reasoning (PRR) branch. CPA branch is built upon attention and produces the image regions. To exploit the progressive interactions among these regions, we represent them as a region graph, on which the parts relation reasoning is performed with graph convolutions, thus leading to our PRR branch. To train our model, we introduce both a transfer loss and a balance loss to contrast class similarities and pursue the maximum response consistency among seen and unseen outputs, respectively. Extensive experiments on four datasets well validate the effectiveness of the proposed method under both ZSL and generalized ZSL settings",

    "abstract": "Training computers to understand, model, and synthesize human grasping requires a rich dataset containing complex 3D object shapes, detailed contact information, hand pose and shape, and the 3D body motion over time. While \"\"grasping\"\" is commonly thought of as a single hand stably lifting an object, we capture the motion of the entire body and adopt the generalized notion of \"\"whole-body grasps\"\". Thus, we collect a new dataset, called GRAB (GRasping Actions with Bodies), of whole-body grasps, containing full 3D shape and pose sequences of 10 subjects interacting with 51 everyday objects of varying shape and size. Given MoCap markers, we fit the full 3D body shape and pose, including the articulated face and hands, as well as the 3D object pose. This gives detailed 3D meshes over time, from which we compute contact between the body and object. This is a unique dataset, that goes well beyond existing ones for modeling and understanding how humans grasp and manipulate objects, how their full body is involved, and how interaction varies with the task. We illustrate the practical value of GRAB with an example application; we train GrabNet, a conditional generative network, to predict 3D hand grasps for unseen 3D object shapes.

We propose a general-purpose DEep MEsh Autoencoder \\hbox{(DEMEA)} which adds a novel embedded deformation layer to a graph-convolutional mesh autoencoder. The embedded deformation layer (EDL) is a differentiable deformable geometric proxy which explicitly models point displacements of non-rigid deformations in a lower dimensional space and serves as a local rigidity regularizer. DEMEA decouples the parameterization of the deformation from the final mesh resolution since the deformation is defined over a lower dimensional embedded deformation graph. We perform a large-scale study on four different datasets of deformable objects. Reasoning about the local rigidity of meshes using EDL allows us to achieve higher-quality results for highly deformable objects, compared to directly regressing vertex positions. We demonstrate multiple applications of DEMEA, including non-rigid 3D reconstruction from depth and shading cues, non-rigid surface tracking, as well as the transfer of deformations over different meshes",

    "abstract": "This paper considers the generic problem of dense alignment between two images, whether they be two frames of a video, two widely different views of a scene, two paintings depicting similar content, etc. Whereas each such task is typically addressed with a domain-specific solution, we show that a simple unsupervised approach performs surprisingly well across a range of tasks. Our main insight is that parametric and non-parametric alignment methods have complementary strengths. We propose a two-stage process: first, a feature-based parametric coarse alignment using one or more homographies, followed by non-parametric fine pixel-wise alignment. Coarse alignment is performed using RANSAC on off-the-shelf deep features. Fine alignment is learned in an unsupervised way by a deep network which optimizes a standard structural similarity metric (SSIM) between the two images, plus cycle-consistency. Despite its simplicity, our method shows competitive results on a range of tasks and datasets, including unsupervised optical flow on KITTI, dense correspondences on Hpatches, two-view geometry estimation on YFCC100M, localization on Aachen Day-Night, and, for the first time, fine alignment of artworks on the Brughel dataset.

A novel refinement step is proposed to align inaccurate poses of objects in source images, which results in better quality images. Evaluations performed on two public datasets show that the rendered images created by NOL lead to state-of-the-art performance in comparison to methods that use 13 times the number of real images.

Our novel hybrid recurrent multi-view stereo net consists of two core modules: 1) a light DRENet (Dense Reception Expanded) module to extract dense feature maps of original size with multi-scale context information, 2) a hybrid HRU-LSTM (Hybrid Recurrent U-LSTM) to regularize 3D matching volume into predicted depth map, which efficiently aggregates different scale information by coupling LSTM and U-Net architecture. To further improve the accuracy and completeness of reconstructed point clouds, we leverage a dynamic consistency checking strategy instead of prefixed parameters and strategies widely adopted in existing methods for dense point cloud reconstruction. In doing so, we dynamically aggregate geometric consistency matching error among all the views.

To this end, we design a Siamese network that jointly learns 3D local feature detection and description directly from raw 3D points. It integrates FlexConv and Squeeze-and-Excitation (SE) to assure that the learned local descriptor captures multi-level geometric information and channel-wise relations. For detecting 3D keypoints we predict the discriminativeness of the local descriptors in an unsupervised manner. We generate the global descriptor by directly aggregating the learned local descriptors with an effective attention mechanism. In this way, local and global 3D descriptors are inferred in one single forward pass. Experiments on various benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves competitive results for both global point cloud retrieval and local point cloud registration in comparison to state-of-the-art approaches. To validate the generalizability and robustness of our 3D keypoints, we demonstrate that our method also performs favorably without fine-tuning on the registration of point clouds that were generated by a visual SLAM system.

However, most of these methods do not well exploit facial structures and identity information, and struggle to deal with facial images that exhibit large pose variations. In this paper, we propose a novel face super-resolution method that explicitly incorporates 3D facial priors which grasp the sharp facial structures. Our work is the first to explore 3D morphable knowledge based on the fusion of parametric descriptions of face attributes (e.g., identity, facial expression, texture, illumination, and face pose). Furthermore, the priors can easily be incorporated into any networks and are extremely efficient in improving the performance and accelerating the convergence speed. Firstly, a 3D face rendering branch is set up to obtain 3D priors of salient facial structures and identity knowledge. Secondly, the Spatial Attention Module is used to better exploit this hierarchical information (i.e., intensity similarity, 3D facial structure, and identity content) for the super-resolution problem. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed 3D priors achieve superior face super-resolution results over the state-of-the-arts",

    "abstract": "Motivated by the problem relatedness between unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) and semi-supervised learning (SSL), many state-of-the-art UDA methods adopt SSL principles (e.g., the cluster assumption) as their learning ingredients. However, they tend to overlook the very domain-shift nature of UDA. In this work, we take a step further to study the proper extensions of SSL techniques for UDA. Taking the algorithm of label propagation (LP) as an example, we analyze the challenges of adopting LP to UDA and theoretically analyze the conditions of affinity graph/matrix construction in order to achieve better propagation of true labels to unlabeled instances. Our analysis suggests a new algorithm of Label Propagation with Augmented Anchors (A$^2$LP), which could potentially improve LP via generation of unlabeled virtual instances (i.e., the augmented anchors) with high-confidence label predictions. To make the proposed A$^2$LP useful for UDA, we propose empirical schemes to generate such virtual instances. The proposed schemes also tackle the domain-shift challenge of UDA by alternating between pseudo labeling via A$^2$LP and domain-invariant feature learning. Experiments show that such a simple SSL extension improves over representative UDA methods of domain-invariant feature learning, and could empower two state-of-the-art methods on benchmark UDA datasets. Our results show the value of further investigation on SSL techniques for UDA problems",

In sample-based experiments, we train a large number (500) of diverse architectures with either supervised or unsupervised objectives, and found that the architecture rankings produced with and without labels are highly correlated. In search-based experiments, we run a well-established NAS algorithm (DARTS) using various unsupervised objectives, and report that the architectures searched without labels can be competitive to their counterparts searched with labels.

We propose two associative alignment strategies: 1) a metric-learning loss for minimizing the distance between related base samples and the centroid of novel instances in the feature space, and 2) a conditional adversarial alignment loss based on the Wasserstein distance. Experiments on four standard datasets and three backbones demonstrate that combining our centroid-based alignment loss results in absolute accuracy improvements of 4.4%, 1.2%, and 6.2% in 5-shot learning over the state of the art for object recognition, fine-grained classification, and cross-domain adaptation, respectively",

In this paper, we propose an approach for learning a compact view-invariant embedding space from 2D joint keypoints alone, without explicitly predicting 3D poses. Since 2D poses are projected from 3D space, they have an inherent ambiguity, which is difficult to represent through a deterministic mapping. Hence, we use probabilistic embeddings to model this input uncertainty. Experimental results show that our embedding model achieves higher accuracy when retrieving similar poses across different camera views, in comparison with 2D-to-3D pose lifting models. We also demonstrate the effectiveness of applying our embeddings to view-invariant action recognition and video alignment. Our code will be released for research",

Flow computed at the coarse level is upsampled and warped to a finer level, enabling the algorithm to accommodate for large motion without a prohibitive search space. We introduce novel cost volume, upsampling, and warping layers to efficiently handle 3D point cloud data. Unlike traditional cost volumes that require exhaustively computing all the cost values on a high-dimensional grid, our point-based formulation discretizes the cost volume onto input 3D points, and a PointConv operation efficiently computes convolutions on the cost volume. Experiment results on FlyingThings3D and KITTI outperform the state-of-the-art by a large margin. We further explore novel self-supervised losses to train our model and achieve comparable results to state-of-the-art trained with supervised loss. Without any fine-tuning, our method also shows great generalization ability on the KITTI Scene Flow 2015 dataset, outperforming all previous methods",

    "title": "Points2Surf Learning Implicit Surfaces from Point Clouds",
    "abstract": "A key step in any scanning-based asset creation workflow is to convert unordered point clouds to a surface. Classical methods (e.g. Poisson reconstruction) start to degrade in the presence of noisy and partial scans. Hence, deep learning based methods have recently been proposed to produce complete surfaces, even from partial scans. However, such data-driven methods struggle to generalize to new shapes with large geometric and topological variations. We present Points2Surf, a novel patch-based learning framework that produces accurate surfaces directly from raw scans without normals. Learning a prior over a combination of detailed local patches and coarse global information improves generalization performance and reconstruction accuracy. Our extensive comparison on both synthetic and real data demonstrates a clear advantage of our method over state-of-the-art alternatives on previously unseen classes (on average, Points2Surf brings down reconstruction error by 30% over SPR and by 270%+ over deep learning based SotA methods) at the cost of longer computation times and a slight increase in small-scale topological noise in some cases.

Most existing approaches are usually data-hungry and have limited generalization abilities. They usually need to be trained on a large number of videos from a target scene to achieve good results in that scene. In this paper, we propose a novel few-shot scene-adaptive anomaly detection problem to address the limitations of previous approaches. Our goal is to learn to detect anomalies in a previously unseen scene with only a few frames. A reliable solution for this new problem will have huge potential in real-world applications since it is expensive to collect a massive amount of data for each target scene.

    "abstract": "Traditional methods for image-based 3D face reconstruction and facial motion retargeting fit a 3D morphable model (3DMM) to the face, which has limited modeling capacity and fail to generalize well to in-the-wild data. Use of deformation transfer or multilinear tensor as a personalized 3DMM for blendshape interpolation does not address the fact that facial expressions result in different local and global skin deformations in different persons. Moreover, existing methods learn a single albedo per user which is not enough to capture the expression-specific skin reflectance variations. We propose an end-to-end framework that jointly learns a personalized face model per user and per-frame facial motion parameters from a large corpus of in-the-wild videos of user expressions. Specifically, we learn user-specific expression blendshapes and dynamic (expression-specific) albedo maps by predicting personalized corrections on top of a 3DMM prior. We introduce novel training constraints to ensure that the corrected blendshapes retain their semantic meanings and the reconstructed geometry is disentangled from the albedo. Experimental results show that our personalization accurately captures fine-grained facial dynamics in a wide range of conditions and efficiently decouples the learned face model from facial motion, resulting in more accurate face reconstruction and facial motion retargeting compared to state-of-the-art methods",

The framework extends previous event-based motion compensation algorithms to handle models whose outputs have arbitrary dimensions. The main motivation comes from estimating motion from events directly in 3D space (e. g. events augmented with depth), without projecting them onto an image plane. This is achieved by modelling the event alignment according to candidate parameters and minimising the resultant dispersion. We provide a family of suitable entropy loss functions and an efficient approximation whose complexity is only linear with the number of events (e. g. the complexity does not depend on the number of image pixels). The framework is evaluated on several motion estimation problems, including optical flow and rotational motion. As proof of concept, we also test our framework on 6-DOF estimation by performing the optimisation directly in 3D space",

    "abstract": "Object detection using an oriented bounding box (OBB) can better target rotated objects by reducing the overlap with background areas. Existing OBB approaches are mostly built on horizontal bounding box detectors by introducing an additional angle dimension optimized by a distance loss. However, as the distance loss only minimizes the angle error of the OBB and that it loosely correlates to the IoU, it is insensitive to objects with high aspect ratios. Therefore, a novel loss, Pixels-IoU (PIoU) Loss, is formulated to exploit both the angle and IoU for accurate OBB regression. The PIoU loss is derived from IoU metric with a pixel-wise form, which is simple and suitable for both horizontal and oriented bounding box. To demonstrate its effectiveness, we evaluate the PIoU loss on both anchor-based and anchor-free frameworks. The experimental results show that PIoU loss can dramatically improve the performance of OBB detectors, particularly on objects with high aspect ratios and complex backgrounds. Besides, previous evaluation datasets did not include scenarios where the objects have high aspect ratios, hence a new dataset, Retail50K, is introduced to encourage the community to adapt OBB detectors for more complex environments",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective approach, named Triple Excitation Network, to reinforce the training of video salient object detection (VSOD) from three aspects, spatial, temporal, and online excitations. These excitation mechanisms are designed following the spirit of curriculum learning and aim to reduce learning ambiguities at the beginning of training by selectively exciting feature activations using ground truth. Then we gradually reduce the weight of ground truth excitations by a curriculum rate and replace it by a curriculum complementary map for better and faster convergence. In particular, the spatial excitation strengthens feature activations for clear object boundaries, while the temporal excitation imposes motions to emphasize spatio-temporal salient regions. Spatial and temporal excitations can combat the saliency shifting problem and conflict between spatial and temporal features of VSOD. Furthermore, our semi-curriculum learning design enables the first online refinement strategy for VSOD, which allows exciting and boosting saliency responses during testing without re-training. The proposed triple excitations can easily plug in different VSOD methods. Extensive experiments show the effectiveness of all three excitation methods and the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art image and video salient object detection methods",

We refer to these models as `Experts’, and the proposed LFME framework aggregates the knowledge from multiple `Experts' to learn a unified student model. Specifically, the proposed framework involves two levels of adaptive learning schedules: Self-paced Expert Selection and Curriculum Instance Selection, so that the knowledge is adaptively transferred to the `Student'. We conduct extensive experiments and demonstrate that our method is able to achieve superior performances compared to state-of-the-art methods.

    "abstract": "In this paper, we investigate a new visual restoration task, termed as hallucinating visual instances in total absentia (HVITA). Unlike conventional image inpainting task that works on images with only part of a visual instance missing, HVITA concerns scenarios where an object is completely absent from the scene. This seemingly minor difference in fact makes the HVITA a much challenging task, as the restoration algorithm would have to not only infer the category of the object in total absentia, but also hallucinate an object of which the appearance is consistent with the background. Towards solving HVITA, we propose an end-to-end deep approach that explicitly looks into the global semantics within the image. Specifically, we transform the input image to a semantic graph, wherein each node corresponds to a detected object in the scene. We then adopt a Graph Convolutional Network on top of the scene graph to estimate the category of the missing object in the masked region, and finally introduce a Generative Adversarial Module to carry out the hallucination. Experiments on COCO, Visual Genome and NYU Depth v2 datasets demonstrate that the proposed approach yields truly encouraging and visually plausible results",

The network jointly optimizes canonical shapes and poses with multi-view geometry constraints during training, and can infer the complete shape given a single partial point cloud.

The proposed DTVNet consists of two submodules: mph{Optical Flow Encoder} (OFE) and mph{Dynamic Video Generator} (DVG). The OFE maps a sequence of optical flow maps to a mph{normalized motion vector} that encodes the motion information inside the generated video. The DVG contains motion and content streams that learn from the motion vector and the single image respectively, as well as an encoder and a decoder to learn shared content features and construct video frames with corresponding motion respectively. Specifically, the mph{motion stream} introduces multiple mph{adaptive instance normalization} (AdaIN) layers to integrate multi-level motion information that are processed by linear layers. In the testing stage, videos with the same content but various motion information can be generated by different mph{normalized motion vectors} based on only one input image.

Compared to conventional depth losses manually defined on a per-pixel basis, the proposed hierarchical loss can be learned in a data-driven manner. As verified by our experiments, the hierarchical loss even learned without additional labels can capture multi-scale context information, is more robust to local outliers, and thus delivers superior performance. To further improve depth accuracy, a cross level identity feature fusion network (CLIFFNet) is proposed, where low-level features with finer details are refined using more reliable high-level cues. Through end-to-end training, CLIFFNet can learn to select the optimal combinations of low-level and high-level features, leading to more effective cross level feature fusion. When trained using the proposed hierarchical loss, CLIFFNet sets a new state of the art on popular depth estimation benchmarks",

In doing so, the agent builds its spatial awareness more rapidly, which facilitates efficient exploration and navigation in 3D environments. By exploiting context in both the egocentric views and top-down maps our model successfully anticipates a broader map of the environment, with performance significantly better than strong baselines.

While image saliency modeling is a well-studied problem and progress on benchmarks like SALICON and MIT300 is slowing, video saliency models have shown rapid gains on the recent DHF1K benchmark. Here, we take a step back and ask: Can image and video saliency modeling be approached via a unified model, with mutual benefit? We identify different sources of domain shift between image and video saliency data and between different video saliency datasets as a key challenge for effective joint modelling. To address this we propose four novel domain adaptation techniques - Domain-Adaptive Priors, Domain-Adaptive Fusion, Domain-Adaptive Smoothing and Bypass-RNN - in addition to an improved formulation of learned Gaussian priors. We integrate these techniques into a simple and lightweight encoder-RNN-decoder-style network, UNISAL, and train it jointly with image and video saliency data. We evaluate our method on the video saliency datasets DHF1K, Hollywood-2 and UCF-Sports, and the image saliency datasets SALICON and MIT300. With one set of parameters, UNISAL achieves state-of-the-art performance on all video saliency datasets and is on par with the state-of-the-art for image saliency datasets, despite faster runtime and a 5 to 20-fold smaller model size compared to all competing deep methods. We provide retrospective analyses and ablation studies which confirm the importance of the domain shift modeling. The code is available at https://github.com/rdroste/unisal",

    "abstract": "For many years, multi-object tracking benchmarks have focused on a handful of categories. Motivated primarily by surveillance and self-driving applications, these datasets provide tracks for people, vehicles, and animals, ignoring the vast majority of objects in the world. By contrast, in the related field of object detection, the introduction of large-scale, diverse datasets (e.g., COCO) have fostered significant progress in developing highly robust solutions. To bridge this gap, we introduce a similarly diverse dataset for Tracking Any Object (TAO). It consists of 2,907 high resolution videos, captured in diverse environments, which are half a minute long on average. Importantly, we adopt a bottom-up approach for discovering a large vocabulary of 833 categories, an order of magnitude more than prior tracking benchmarks. To this end, we ask annotators to label objects that move at any point in the video, and give names to them post factum. Our vocabulary is both significantly larger and qualitatively different from existing tracking datasets. To ensure scalability of annotation, we employ a federated approach that focuses manual effort on labeling tracks for those relevant objects in a video (e.g., those that move). We perform an extensive evaluation of state-of-the-art trackers and make a number of important discoveries regarding large-vocabulary tracking in an open-world. In particular, we show that existing single- and multi-object trackers struggle when applied to this scenario in the wild, and that detection-based, multi-object trackers are in fact competitive with user-initialized ones. We hope that our dataset and analysis will boost further progress in the tracking community",

    "abstract": "We present Generalized Histogram Thresholding (GHT), a simple, fast, and effective technique for histogram-based image thresholding. GHT works by performing approximate maximum a posteriori estimation of a mixture of Gaussians with appropriate priors. We demonstrate that GHT subsumes three classic thresholding techniques as special cases: Otsu's method, Minimum Error Thresholding (MET), and weighted percentile thresholding. GHT thereby enables the continuous interpolation between those three algorithms, which allows thresholding accuracy to be improved significantly. GHT also provides a clarifying interpretation of the common practice of coarsening a histogram's bin width during thresholding. We show that GHT outperforms or matches the performance of all algorithms on a recent challenge for handwritten document image binarization (including deep neural networks trained to produce per-pixel binarizations), and can be implemented in a dozen lines of code or as a trivial modification to Otsu's method or MET",

    "abstract": "Autonomous agents must learn to collaborate. It is not scalable to develop a new centralized agent every time a task’s difficulty outpaces a single agent’s abilities. While multi-agent collaboration research has flourished in gridworld-like environments, relatively little work has considered visually rich domains. Addressing this, we introduce the novel task FurnMove in which agents work together to move a piece of furniture through a living room to a goal. Unlike existing tasks, FurnMove requires agents to coordinate at every timestep. We identify two challenges when training agents to complete FurnMove: existing decentralized action sampling procedures do not permit expressive joint action policies and, in tasks requiring close coordination, the number of failed actions dominates successful actions. To confront these challenges we introduce SYNC-policies (synchronize your actions coherently) and CORDIAL (coordination loss). Using SYNC-policies and CORDIAL, our agents achieve a 58% completion rate on FurnMove, an impressive absolute gain of 25 percentage points over competitive decentralized baselines.

We propose Visual COMET, the novel framework of visual common-sense reasoning tasks to predict events that might have happened before, events that might happen next, and the intents of the people at present. To support research toward visual commonsense reasoning, we introduce the first large-scale repository of Visual Commonsense Graphs that consists of over 1.4 million textual descriptions of visual commonsense inferences carefully annotated over a diverse set of 59,000 images, each paired with short video summaries of before and after. In addition, we provide person-grounding (i.e., co-reference links) between people appearing in the image and people mentioned in the textual commonsense descriptions, allowing for tighter integration between images and text. We establish strong baseline performances on this task and demonstrate that integration between visual and textual commonsense reasoning is the key and wins over non-integrative alternatives",

    "abstract": "Many few-shot learning models focus on recognising images. In contrast, we tackle a challenging task of few-shot action recognition from videos. We build on a C3D encoder for spatio-temporal video blocks to capture short-range action patterns. Such encoded blocks are aggregated by permutation-invariant pooling to make our approach robust to varying action lengths and long-range temporal dependencies whose patterns are unlikely to repeat even in clips of the same class. Subsequently, the pooled representations are combined into simple relation descriptors which encode so-called query and support clips. Finally, relation descriptors are fed to the comparator with the goal of similarity learning between query and support clips. Importantly, to re-weight block contributions during pooling, we exploit spatial and temporal attention modules and self-supervision. In naturalistic clips (of the same class) there exists a temporal distribution shift--the locations of discriminative temporal action hotspots vary. Thus, we permute blocks of a clip and align the resulting attention regions with similarly permuted attention regions of non-permuted clip to train the attention mechanism invariant to block (and thus long-term hotspot) permutations.

    "abstract": "Most state-of-the-art object detection systems follow an anchor-based diagram. Anchor boxes are densely proposed over the images and the network is trained to predict the boxes position offset as well as the classification confidence. Existing systems pre-define anchor box shapes and sizes and ad-hoc heuristic adjustments are used to define the anchor configurations. However, this might be sub-optimal or even wrong when a new dataset or a new model is adopted. In this paper, we study the problem of automatically optimizing anchor boxes for object detection. We first demonstrate that the number of anchors, anchor scales and ratios are crucial factors for a reliable object detection system. By carefully analyzing the existing bounding box patterns on the feature hierarchy, we design a flexible and tight hyper-parameter space for anchor configurations. Then we propose a novel hyper-parameter optimization method named AABO to determine more appropriate anchor boxes for a certain dataset, in which Bayesian Optimization and subsampling method are combined to achieve precise and efficient anchor configuration optimization. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method on different detectors and datasets, e.g. achieving around 2.4% mAP improvement on COCO, 1.6% on ADE and 1.5% on VG, and the optimal anchors can bring 1.4% ∼ 2.4% mAP improvement on SOTA detectors by only optimizing anchor configurations, e.g. boosting Mask RCNN from 40.3% to 42.3%, and HTC detector from 46.8% to 48.2%",

    "abstract": "Video recognition has been advanced in recent years by benchmarks with rich annotations. However, research is still mainly limited to human action or sports recognition - focusing on a highly specific video understanding task and thus leaving a significant gap towards describing the overall content of a video. We fill this gap by presenting a large-scale ``Holistic Video Understanding Dataset\"\"~(HVU). HVU is organized hierarchically in a semantic taxonomy that focuses on multi-label and multi-task video understanding as a comprehensive problem that encompasses the recognition of multiple semantic aspects in the dynamic scene. HVU contains approx.~572k videos in total with 9 million annotations for training, validation, and test set spanning over 3142 labels. HVU encompasses semantic aspects defined on categories of scenes, objects, actions, events, attributes, and concepts which naturally capture the real-world scenarios.We demonstrate the generalisation capability of HVU on three challenging tasks: 1.) Video classification, 2.) Video captioning and 3.) Video clustering tasks. In particular for video classification, we introduce a new spatio-temporal deep neural network architecture called ``Holistic Appearance and Temporal Network\"\"~(HATNet) that builds on fusing 2D and 3D architectures into one by combining intermediate representations of appearance and temporal cues. HATNet focuses on the multi-label and multi-task learning problem and is trained in an end-to-end manner. %The experiments show that HATNet trained on HVU outperforms current state-of-the-art methods on challenging human action datasets: HMDB51, UCF101, and Kinetics.

In this paper, we show that the resulting networks are sensitive not only to global adversarial attacks, where perturbations affect the entire input image, but also to indirect local attacks, where the perturbations are confined to a small image region that does not overlap with the area that the attacker aims to fool. To this end, we introduce an indirect attack strategy, namely adaptive local attacks, aiming to find the best image location to perturb, while preserving the labels at this location and producing a realistic-looking segmentation map. Furthermore, we propose attack detection techniques both at the global image level and to obtain a pixel-wise localization of the fooled regions. Our results are unsettling: Because they exploit a larger context, more accurate semantic segmentation networks are more sensitive to indirect local attacks. We believe that our comprehensive analysis will motivate the community to design architectures with contextual dependencies that do not trade off robustness for accuracy",

    "abstract": "To what extent are two images picturing the same 3D surfaces? Even when this is a known scene, the answer typically requires an expensive search across scale space, with matching and geometric verification of large sets of local features. This expense is further multiplied when a query image is evaluated against a gallery, e.g. in visual relocalization. While we don't obviate the need for geometric verification, we propose an interpretable image-embedding that cuts the search in scale space to essentially a lookup.Our approach measures the asymmetric distance between two images. The model then learns a scene-specific measure of similarity, from training examples with known 3D visible-surface overlaps. The result is that we can quickly identify, for example, which test image is a close-up version of another, and by what scale factor. Subsequently, local features need only be detected at that scale. We validate our scene-specific model by showing how this embedding yields competitive image-matching results, while being simpler, faster, and also interpretable by humans",

The so-called physical adversarial examples deceive DNN-based decision makers by attaching adversarial patches to real objects. However, most of the existing works on physical adversarial attacks focus on static objects such as glass frames, stop signs and images attached to cardboard. In this work, we proposed adversarial T-shirts, a robust physical adversarial example for evading person detectors even if it could undergo non-rigid deformation due to a moving person’s pose changes. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that models the effect of deformation for designing physical adversarial examples with respect to non-rigid objects such as T-shirts. We show that the proposed method achieves 74% and 57% attack success rates in the digital and physical worlds respectively against YOLOv2. In contrast, the state-of-the-art physical attack method to fool a person detector only achieves 18% attack success rate.

    "abstract": "Recognizing the relationship between multiple objects in an image is essential for a deeper understanding of the meaning of the image. However, current visual recognition methods are still far from reaching human-level accuracy. Recent approaches have tackled this task by combining image features with semantic and spatial features, but the way they relate them to each other is weak, mostly because the spatial context in the image feature is lost. In this paper, we propose the bounding-box channels, a novel architecture capable of relating the semantic, spatial, and image features strongly. Our network learns bounding-box channels, which are initialized according to the position of the objects and the label of objects, and concatenated to the image features extracted from the objects. Then, they are input together to the relationship estimator. Our method can retain the spatial information in the image features, and strongly associate them with the semantic and spatial features. This way, our method is capable of effectively emphasizing the features in the object area for a better modeling of the relationships within objects. In addition, we experimentally show that our bounding-box channels have a high generalization ability.

When focal length has not been calibrated offline, the parameters that describe the radial and rolling shutter distortions are usually unknown. While for global shutter cameras, minimal solvers for the absolute camera pose and unknown focal length and radial distortion are available, solvers for the rolling shutter were missing. We present the first minimal solutions for the absolute pose of a rolling shutter camera with unknown rolling shutter parameters, focal length, and radial distortion. Our new minimal solvers combine iterative schemes designed for calibrated rolling shutter cameras with fast generalized eigenvalue and Groebner basis solvers. In a series of experiments, with both synthetic and real data, we show that our new solvers provide accurate estimates of the camera pose, rolling shutter parameters, focal length, and radial distortion parameters",

Moreover, we utilize the strong image posterior learned by SRFlow to design flexible image manipulation techniques, capable of enhancing super-resolved images by, e.g., transferring content from other images. We perform extensive experiments on faces, as well as on super-resolution in general.

We extract the latent space of real-world reflectance by conditioning this model, which directly results in a strong reflectance prior. We refer to this model as the invertible neural BRDF model (iBRDF). We also devise a deep illumination prior by leveraging the structural bias of deep neural networks. By integrating this novel BRDF model and reflectance and illumination priors in a MAP estimation formulation, we show that this joint estimation can be computed efficiently with stochastic gradient descent. We experimentally validate the accuracy of the invertible neural BRDF model on a large number of measured data and demonstrate its use in object inverse rendering on a number of synthetic and real images.

    "abstract": "While existing works have explored a variety of techniques to push the envelop of weakly-supervised semantic segmentation, there is still a significant gap compared to the supervised methods. In real-world application, besides massive amount of weakly-supervised data there are usually a few available pixel-level annotations, based on which semi-supervised track becomes a promising way for semantic segmentation. Current methods simply bundle these two different sets of annotations together to train a segmentation network. However, we discover that such treatment is problematic and achieves even worse results than just using strong labels, which indicates the misuse of the weak ones. To fully explore the potential of the weak labels, we propose to impose separate treatments of strong and weak annotations via a strong-weak dual-branch network, which discriminates the massive inaccurate weak supervisions from those strong ones. We design a shared network component to exploit the joint discrimination of strong and weak annotations; meanwhile, the proposed dual branches separately handle full and weak supervised learning and effectively eliminate their mutual interference.

    "title": "Practical Deep Raw Image Denoising on Mobile Devices",
    "abstract": "Deep learning-based image denoising approaches have been extensively studied in recent years, prevailing in many public benchmark datasets. However, the stat-of-the-art networks are computationally too expensive to be directly applied on mobile devices. In this work, we propose a light-weight, efficient neural network-based raw image denoiser that runs smoothly on mainstream mobile devices, and produces high quality denoising results. Our key insights are twofold:(1) by measuring and estimating sensor noise level, a smaller network trained on synthetic sensor-specific data can out-perform larger ones trained on general data;(2) the large noise level variation under different ISO settings can be removed by a novel k-Sigma Transform, allowing a small network to efficiently handle a wide range of noise levels. We conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate the efficiency and accuracy of our approach. Our proposed mobile-friendly denoising model runs at ~70 milliseconds per megapixel on Qualcomm Snapdragon 855 chipset, and it is the basis of the night shot feature of several flagship smartphones released in 2019",

    "abstract": "Moving around in the world is naturally a multi-sensory experience, but today's embodied agents are deaf - restricted to solely their visual perception of the environment. We introduce audio-visual navigation for complex, acoustically and visually realistic 3D environments. By both seeing and hearing, the agent must learn to navigate to an audio-based target. We develop a multi-modal deep reinforcement learning pipeline to train navigation policies end-to-end from a stream of egocentric audio-visual observations, allowing the agent to (1) discover elements of the geometry of the physical space indicated by the reverberating audio and (2) detect and follow sound-emitting targets. We further introduce audio renderings based on geometrical acoustic simulations for a set of publicly available 3D assets and instrument AI-Habitat to support the new sensor, making it possible to insert arbitrary sound sources in an array of apartment, office, and hotel environments. Our results show that audio greatly benefits embodied visual navigation in 3D spaces",

However, without frame-level annotations, it is challenging for W-TAL methods to identify false positive action proposals and generate action proposals with precise temporal boundaries. In this paper, we present a Two-Stream Consensus Network (TSCN) to simultaneously address these challenges. The proposed TSCN features an iterative refinement training method, where a frame-level pseudo ground truth is iteratively updated, and used to provide frame-level supervision for improved model training and false positive action proposal elimination. Furthermore, we propose a new attention normalization loss to encourage the predicted attention to act like a binary selection, and promote the precise localization of action instance boundaries. Experiments conducted on the THUMOS14 and ActivityNet datasets show that the proposed TSCN outperforms current state-of-the-art methods, and even achieves comparable results with some recent fully-supervised methods",

Achieving adequate smoothing is a fundamental goal of these image smoothing algorithms. We show that partially \"\"erasing\"\" the appearance preservation facilitate adequate image smoothing. In this paper, we call this manipulation as Erasing Appearance Preservation (EAP). We conduct an user study, allowing users to indicate the \"\"erasing\"\" positions by drawing scribbles interactively, to verify the correctness and effectiveness of EAP. We observe the characteristics of human-indicated \"\"erasing\"\" positions, and then formulate a simple and effective 0-1 knapsack to automatically synthesize the \"\"erasing\"\" positions. We test our synthesized erasing positions in a majority of image smoothing methods. Experimental results and large-scale perceptual human judgments show that the EAP solution tends to encourage the pattern separation or elimination capabilities of image smoothing algorithms. We further study the performance of the EAP solution in many image decomposition problems to decompose textures, shadows, and the challenging specular reflections. We also present examinations of diversiform image manipulation applications like texture removal, retexturing, intrinsic decomposition, layer extraction, recoloring, material manipulation, etc. Due to the widespread applicability of image smoothing, the EAP is also likely to be used in more image editing applications",

    "abstract": "Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) is a task where agents must decide how to move through a 3D environment to reach a goal by grounding natural language instructions to the visual surroundings. One of the problems of the VLN task is data scarcity since it is difficult to collect enough navigation paths with human-annotated instructions for interactive environments. In this paper, we explore the use of counterfactual thinking as a human-inspired data augmentation method that results in robust models. Counterfactual thinking is a concept that describes the human propensity to create possible alternatives to life events that have already occurred. We propose an adversarial-driven counterfactual reasoning model that can consider effective conditions instead of low-quality augmented data. In particular, we present a model-agnostic adversarial path sampler (APS) that learns to sample challenging paths that force the navigator to improve based on the navigation performance. APS also serves to do pre-exploration of unseen environments to strengthen the model's ability to generalize. We evaluate the influence of APS on the performance of different VLN baseline models using the room-to-room dataset (R2R). The results show that the adversarial training process with our proposed APS benefits VLN models under both seen and unseen environments. And the pre-exploration process can further gain additional improvements under unseen environments",

To address this limitation, in this study, we propose a guided deep decoder network as a general prior. The proposed network is composed of an encoder-decoder network that exploits multi-scale features of a guidance image and a deep decoder network that generates an output image. The two networks are connected by feature refinement units to embed the multi-scale features of the guidance image into the deep decoder network. The proposed network allows the network parameters to be optimized in an unsupervised way without training data.

    "abstract": "Over the past few years, image-to-image style transfer has risen to the frontiers of neural image processing. While conventional methods were successful in various tasks such as color and texture transfer between images, none could effectively work with the custom filter effects that are applied by users through various platforms like Instagram. In this paper, we introduce a new concept of style transfer, Filter Style Transfer (FST). Unlike conventional style transfer, new technique FST can extract and transfer custom filter style from a filtered style image to a content image. FST first infers the original image from a filtered reference via image-to-image translation. Then it estimates filter parameters from the difference between them. To resolve the ill-posed nature of reconstructing the original image from the reference, we represent each pixel color of an image to class mean and deviation. Besides, to handle the intra-class color variation, we propose an uncertainty based weighted least square method for restoring an original image. To the best of our knowledge, FST is the first style transfer method that can transfer custom filter effects between FHD image under 2ms on a mobile device without any textual context loss",

    "abstract": "State-of-the-art single depth image-based 3D hand pose estimation methods are based on dense predictions, including voxel-to-voxel predictions, point-to-point regression, and pixel-wise estimations. Despite the good performance, those methods have a few issues in nature, such as the poor trade-off between accuracy and efficiency, and plain feature representation learning with local convolutions. In this paper, a novel pixel-wise prediction-based method is proposed to address the above issues. The key ideas are two-fold: a) explicitly modeling the dependencies among joints and the relations between the pixels and the joints for better local feature representation learning; b) unifying the dense pixel-wise offset predictions and direct joint regression for end-to-end training. Specifically, we first propose a graph convolutional network (GCN) based joint graph reasoning module to model the complex dependencies among joints and augment the representation capability of each pixel. Then we densely estimate all pixels' offsets to joints in both image plane and depth space and calculate the joints' positions by a weighted average over all pixels' predictions, totally discarding the complex post-processing operations. The proposed model is implemented with an efficient 2D fully convolutional network (FCN) backbone and has only about 1.4M parameters. Extensive experiments on multiple 3D hand pose estimation benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed method achieves new state-of-the-art accuracy while running very efficiently with around a speed of 110fps on a single NVIDIA 1080Ti GPU",

    "abstract": "Replacing normal convolutions with group convolutions can significantly increase the computational efficiency of modern deep convolutional networks, which has been widely adopted in compact network architecture designs. However, existing group convolutions undermine the original network structures by cutting off some connections permanently resulting in significant accuracy degradation. In this paper, we propose dynamic group convolution (DGC) that adaptively selects which part of input channels to be connected within each group for individual samples on the fly. Specifically, we equip each group with a small feature selector to automatically select the most important input channels conditioned on the input images. Multiple groups can adaptively capture abundant and complementary visual/semantic features for each input image. The DGC preserves the original network structure and has similar computational efficiency as the conventional group convolution simultaneously. Extensive experiments on multiple image classification benchmarks including CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and ImageNet demonstrate its superiority over the existing group convolution techniques and dynamic execution methods.

Recently some GAN-based methods were proposed for style transfer; however, they treated Chinese characters as a whole, ignoring the structures and radicals that compose characters. In this paper, a novel radical decomposition-and-rendering-based GAN(RD-GAN) is proposed to utilize the radical-level compositions of Chinese characters and achieves few-shot/zero-shot Chinese character style transfer. The RD-GAN consists of three components: a radical extraction module (REM), radical rendering module (RRM), and multi-level discriminator (MLD). Experiments demonstrate that our method has a powerful few-shot/zero-shot generalization ability by using the radical-level compositions of Chinese characters",

Our motivation is that the label of a pixel is the category of the object that the pixel belongs to. We present a simple yet effective approach, object-contextual representations, characterizing a pixel by exploiting the representation of the corresponding object class. First, we learn object regions under the supervision of the ground-truth segmentation. Second, we compute the object region representation by aggregating the representations of the pixels lying in the object region. Last, % the representation similarity we compute the relation between each pixel and each object region, and augment the representation of each pixel with the object-contextual representation which is a weighted aggregation of all the object region representations according to their relations with the pixel. We empirically demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves competitive performance on various challenging semantic segmentation benchmarks: Cityscapes, ADE20K, LIP, PASCAL-Context, and COCO-Stuff.

To generate the proxies' textures, we learn a joint latent space allowing category-level appearance and geometry interpolation. The proxies are independently rasterized with their corresponding neural texture and composited using a U-Net, which generates an output photorealistic image including an alpha map. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by reconstructing complex objects from a sparse set of views.

How should an exploration policy decide which trajectory should be labeled? One possibility is to use a trained object detector's failure cases as an external reward. However, this will require labeling millions of frames required for training RL policies, which is infeasible. Instead, we explore a self-supervised approach for training our exploration policy by introducing a notion of semantic curiosity. Our semantic curiosity policy is based on a simple observation -- the detection outputs should be consistent. Therefore, our semantic curiosity rewards trajectories with inconsistent labeling behavior and encourages the exploration policy to explore such areas. The exploration policy trained via semantic curiosity generalizes to novel scenes and helps train an object detector that outperforms baselines trained with other possible alternatives such as random exploration, prediction-error curiosity, and coverage-maximizing exploration",

Multi-scale (MS) approach has been widely used for deblurring that sequentially recovers the downsampled original image in low spatial scale first and then further restores in high spatial scale using the result(s) from lower spatial scale(s). Here, we investigate a novel alternative approach to MS, called multi-temporal (MT), for non-uniform single image deblurring by exploiting time-resolved deblurring dataset from high-speed cameras. MT approach models severe blurs as a series of small blurs so that it deblurs small amount of blurs in the original spatial scale progressively instead of restoring the images in different spatial scales. To realize MT approach, we propose progressive deblurring over iterations and incremental temporal training with temporally augmented training data. Our MT approach, that can be seen as a form of curriculum learning in a wide sense, allows a number of state-of-the-art MS based deblurring methods to yield improved performances without using MS approach.

Moreover, we propose an auxiliary anchor-free enhancement module to facilitate the learning of small faces by supplying positive anchors that may be not covered according to the criterion of IoU overlap. Such anchor-free module will be removed during inference and hence no extra computation cost is introduced. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our method compared to the state-of-the-arts on the standard FDDB and WIDER FACE benchmarks. Especially, our ProgressFace-Light with MobileNet-0.25 backbone achieves 87.9% AP on the hard set of WIDER FACE, surpassing largely RetinaFace with the same backbone by 9.7%.

    "title": "Learning Multi-layer Latent Variable Model via Variational Optimization of Short Run MCMC for Approximate Inference",
    "abstract": "This paper studies the fundamental problem of learning deep generative models that consist of multiple layers of latent variables organized in top-down architectures. Such models have high expressivity and allow for learning hierarchical representations. Learning such a generative model requires inferring the latent variables for each training example based on the posterior distribution of these latent variables. The inference typically requires Markov chain Monte Caro (MCMC) that can be time consuming. In this paper, we propose to use noise initialized non-persistent short run MCMC, such as finite step Langevin dynamics initialized from the prior distribution of the latent variables, as an approximate inference engine, where the step size of the Langevin dynamics is variationally optimized by minimizing the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the distribution produced by the short run MCMC and the posterior distribution. Our experiments show that the proposed method outperforms variational auto-encoder (VAE) in terms of reconstruction error and synthesis quality. The advantage of the proposed method is that it is simple and automatic without the need to design an inference model",

    "abstract": "Modeling relations is crucial to understand videos for action and behavior recognition. Current relation models mainly reason about relations of invisibly implicit cues, while important relations of visually explicit cues are rarely considered, and the collaboration between them is usually ignored. In this paper, we propose a novel relation model that discovers relations of both implicit and explicit cues as well as their collaboration in videos. Our model concerns Collaborative Ternary Relations (CoTeRe), where the ternary relation involves channel (C, for implicit), temporal (T, for implicit), and spatial (S, for explicit) relation (R). We devise a flexible and effective CTSR module to collaborate ternary relations for 3D-CNNs, and then construct CoTeRe-Nets for action recognition. Extensive experiments on both ablation study and performance evaluation demonstrate that our CTSR module is significantly effective with approximate 3% gains and our CoTeRe-Nets outperform state-of-the-art approaches on three popular benchmarks. Boosts analysis and relations visualization also validate that relations of both implicit and explicit cues are discovered with efficacy by our method.

These distortion effects are surprisingly large and can not be explained by traditional camera models. Instead of using a generalized camera approach, we propose a novel approach to jointly optimize a traditional camera model, and a mathematical representation of the windshield’s surface. First, using the laws of geometric optics, the refraction is modeled using a local spherical approximation to the windshield’s geometry. Next, a spline-based model is proposed as a refinement to better adapt to deviations from the ideal shape and manufacturing variations. By jointly optimizing refraction and camera parameters, the projection error can be significantly reduced. The proposed models are validated on real windshield observations and custom setups to compare recordings with and without windshield, with accurate laser scan measurements as 3D ground truth",

    "title": "Unsupervised Domain Adaptation for Semantic Segmentation of NIR Images through Generative Latent Search",
    "abstract": "Segmentation of the pixels corresponding to human skin is an essential first step in multiple applications ranging from surveillance to heart-rate estimation from remote-photoplethysmography. However, the existing literature considers the problem only in the visible-range of the EM-spectrum which limits their utility in low or no light settings where the criticality of the application is higher. To alleviate this problem, we consider the problem of skin segmentation from the Near-infrared images. However, Deep learning based state-of-the-art segmentation techniques demands large amounts of labelled data that is unavailable for the current problem. Therefore we cast the skin segmentation problem as that of target-independent Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) where we use the data from the Red-channel of the visible-range to develop skin segmentation algorithm on NIR images. We propose a method for target-independent segmentation where the 'nearest-clone' of a target image in the source domain is searched and used as a proxy in the segmentation network trained only on the source domain. We prove the existence of 'nearest-clone' and propose a method to find it through an optimization algorithm over the latent space of a Deep generative model based on variational inference. We demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method for NIR skin segmentation over the state-of-the-art UDA segmentation methods on the two newly created skin segmentation datasets in NIR domain despite not having access to the target NIR data. Additionally, we report state-of-the-art results for adaption from Synthia to Cityscapes which is a popular setting in Unsupervised Domain Adaptation for semantic segmentation.

In this work, we report that the activation instability induced by weight quantization (AIWQ) is the key obstacle to sub-4-bit quantization of mobile networks. To alleviate the AIWQ problem, we propose a novel training method called PROgressive-Freezing Iterative Training (PROFIT), which attempts to freeze layers whose weights are affected by the instability problem stronger than the other layers. We also propose a differentiable and unified quantization method (DuQ) and a negative padding idea to support asymmetric activation functions such as h-swish. We evaluate the proposed methods by quantizing MobileNet-v1, v2, and v3 on ImageNet and report that 4-bit quantization offers comparable (within 1.48 % top-1 accuracy) accuracy to full precision baseline. In the ablation study of the 3-bit quantization of MobileNet-v3, our proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art method by a large margin, 12.86 % of top-1 accuracy.

The task aims at spatio-temporally localizing the given relations in the form of subject-predicate-object in the videos, so as to provide supportive visual facts for other high-level video-language tasks (e.g., video-language grounding and video question answering). The challenges in this task include but not limited to: (1) both the subject and object are required to be spatio-temporally localized to ground a query relation; (2) the temporal dynamic nature of visual relations in videos is difficult to capture; and (3) the grounding should be achieved without any direct supervision in space and time. To ground the relations, we tackle the challenges by collaboratively optimizing two sequences of regions over a constructed hierarchical spatio-temporal region graph through relation attending and reconstruction, in which we further propose a message passing mechanism by spatial attention shifting between visual entities. Experimental results demonstrate that our model can not only outperform baseline approaches significantly, but also produces visually meaningful facts to support visual grounding.

Essential to learning is leveraging effective 3D human priors, and the ability to work under weak supervision, at scale, by exploiting, to the largest extent, the detailed human body semantics in images. In this paper we present new priors as well as large-scale weakly supervised models for 3D human pose and shape estimation. Key to our formulation are new latent normalizing flow representations, as well as fully differentiable, structurally-sensitive, semantic body part alignment(re-projection) loss functions that ensure consistent estimates and sharp feedback signals for learning. In extensive experiments using both motion capture datasets like CMU, Human3.6M, 3DPW, or AMASS, and repositories like COCO, we show that our proposed methods outperform existing counterparts, supporting the construction of an increasingly more accurate family of models based on large-scale training with unlabeled image data",

We exploit sparse semantic maps to control object shapes and classes, as well as textual descriptions or attributes to control both local and global style. In order to condition our model on textual descriptions, we introduce a semantic attention module whose computational cost is independent of the image resolution. To further augment the controllability of the scene, we propose a two-step generation scheme that decomposes background and foreground. The label maps used to train our model are produced by a large-vocabulary object detector, which enables access to unlabeled data and provides structured instance information. In such a setting, we report better FID scores compared to fully-supervised settings where the model is trained on ground-truth semantic maps.

    "abstract": "We propose the first network to jointly learn visual motion and confidence from events in spatially local patches. Event-based sensors deliver high temporal resolution motion information in a sparse, non-redundant format. This creates the potential for low computation, low latency motion recognition. Neural networks which extract global motion information, however, are generally computationally expensive. Here, we introduce a novel shallow and compact neural architecture and learning approach to capture reliable visual motion information along with the corresponding confidence of inference. Our network makes a prediction of the visual motion at each spatial location using only local events. Our confidence network then identifies which of these predictions will be accurate. In the task of recovering pan-tilt ego velocities from events, we show that each individual confident local prediction of our network can be expected to be as accurate as state of the art optimization approaches which utilize the full image. Furthermore, on a publicly available dataset, we find our local predictions generalize to scenes with camera motions and the presence of independently moving objects. This makes the output of our network well suited for motion based tasks, such as the segmentation of independently moving objects. We demonstrate on a publicly available motion segmentation dataset that restricting predictions to confident regions is sufficient to achieve results that exceed state of the art methods",

    "abstract": "Dense Video Captioning (DVC) is a challenging task that localizes all events in a short video and describes them with natural language sentences. The main goal of DVC is video story description, that is, to generate a concise video story that supports human video comprehension without watching it. In recent years, DVC has attracted increasing attention in the research community of Vision and Language, and has been employed as a task of the workshop, ActivityNet Challenge. In the current research community, the official scorer provided by AcivityNet Challenge is the de-facto standard evaluation framework for DVC systems. It computes averaged METEOR scores for matched pairs between generated and reference captions whose Interval of Union (IoU) exceeds a specific threshold value. However, the current framework does not take into account the story of the video, the ordering of captions. It also tends to give high scores to systems that generate redundant, several hundred captions, that humans cannot read. This paper proposes a new evaluation framework, Story Oriented Dense video cAptioning evaluation framework (SODA), for measuring the performance of video story description systems. SODA first tries to find temporally optimal matching between generated and reference captions to capture a story for a video. Then, it computes METEOR scores for the matching and derives F-measure scores from the METEOR scores to penalize redundant captions. To demonstrate that SODA gives low scores for inadequate captions in terms of video story description, we evaluate two state-of-the-art systems with it, varying the number of captions. The results show that SODA can give low scores against too many or too few captions and high scores against captions whose number equals to that of a reference, while the current framework gives good scores for all the cases. Furthermore, we show that SODA tends to give lower scores than the current evaluation framework in evaluating captions with incorrect order",

    "title": "Sketch-Guided Object Localization in Natural Images",
    "abstract": "We introduce a novel problem of localizing all the instances of an object (seen or unseen during training) in a natural image via sketch query. We refer to this problem as sketch-guided object localization. This problem is distinctively different from the traditional sketch-based image retrieval task where the gallery set often contains images with only one object. The sketch-guided object localization proves to be more challenging when we consider the following: (i) the sketches used as queries are abstract representations with little information on the shape and salient attributes of the object, (ii) the sketches have significant variability as they are hand-drawn by a diverse set of untrained human subjects, and (iii) there exists a domain gap between sketch queries and target natural images as these are sampled from very different data distributions. To address the problem of sketch-guided object localization, we propose a novel mph{cross-modal attention} scheme that guides the region proposal network (RPN) to generate object proposals relevant to the sketch query. These object proposals are later scored against the query to obtain final localization. Our method is effective with as little as a single sketch query. Moreover, it also generalizes well to object categories not seen during training and is effective in localizing multiple object instances present in the image. Furthermore, we extend our framework to a multi-query setting using novel feature fusion and attention fusion strategies introduced in this paper. The localization performance is evaluated on publicly available object detection benchmarks, viz. MS-COCO and PASCAL-VOC, with sketch queries obtained from `Quick, Draw!'. The proposed method significantly outperforms related baselines on both single-query and multi-query localization tasks",

    "title": "A unifying mutual information view of metric learning: cross-entropy vs. pairwise losses",
    "abstract": "Recently, substantial research efforts in Deep Metric Learning (DML) focused on designing complex pairwise-distance losses, which require convoluted schemes to ease optimization, such as sample mining or pair weighting. The standard cross-entropy loss for classification has been largely overlooked in DML. On the surface, the cross-entropy may seem unrelated and irrelevant to metric learning as it does not explicitly involve pairwise distances. However, we provide a theoretical analysis that links the cross-entropy to several well-known and recent pairwise losses. Our connections are drawn from two different perspectives: one based on an explicit optimization insight; the other on discriminative and generative views of the mutual information between the labels and the learned features. First, we explicitly demonstrate that the cross-entropy is an upper bound on a new pairwise loss, which has a structure similar to various pairwise losses: it minimizes intra-class distances while maximizing inter-class distances. As a result, minimizing the cross-entropy can be seen as an approximate bound-optimization (or Majorize-Minimize) algorithm for minimizing this pairwise loss. Second, we show that, more generally,minimizing the cross-entropy is actually equivalent to maximizing the mutual information, to which we connect several well-known pairwise losses. Furthermore, we show that various standard pairwise losses can be explicitly related to one another via bound relationships. Our findings indicate that the cross-entropy represents a proxy for maximizing the mutual information – as pairwise losses do – without the need for convoluted sample-mining heuristics. Our experiments†over four standard DML benchmarks strongly support our findings. We obtain state-of-the-art results, outperforming recent and complex DML methods",

To reveal the secrets behind the scene, we present VALUE (Vision-And-Language Understanding Evaluation), a set of meticulously designed probing tasks (e.g., Visual Coreference Resolution, Visual Relation Detection) generalizable to standard pre-trained V+L models, to decipher the inner workings of multimodal pre-training (e.g., implicit knowledge garnered in individual attention heads, inherent cross-modal alignment learned through contextualized multimodal embeddings). Through extensive analysis of each archetypal model architecture via these probing tasks, our key observations are: (i) Pre-trained models exhibit a propensity for attending over text rather than images during inference. (ii) There exists a subset of attention heads that are tailored for capturing cross-modal interactions. (iii) Learned attention matrix in pre-trained models demonstrates patterns coherent with the latent alignment between image regions and textual words. (iv) Plotted attention patterns reveal visually-interpretable relations among image regions. (v) Pure linguistic knowledge is also effectively encoded in the attention heads.

    "abstract": "The SMPL body model is widely used for the estimation, synthesis, and analysis of 3D human pose and shape. While popular, we show that SMPL has several limitations and introduce STAR, which is quantitatively and qualitatively superior to SMPL. First, SMPL has a huge number of parameters resulting from its use of global blend shapes. These dense pose-corrective offsets relate every vertex on the mesh to all the joints in the kinematic tree, capturing spurious long-range cor- relations. To address this, we define per-joint pose correctives and learn the subset of mesh vertices that are influenced by each joint movement. This sparse formulation results in more realistic deformations and significantly reduces the number of model parameters to 20% of SMPL. When trained on the same data as SMPL, STAR generalizes better despite having many fewer parameters. Second, SMPL factors pose-dependent deformations from body shape while, in reality, people with different shapes deform differently. Consequently, we learn shape-dependent pose- corrective blendshapes that depend on both body pose and BMI. Third, we show that the shape space of SMPL is not rich enough to capture the variation in the human population. We address this by training STAR with an additional 10,000 scans of male and female subjects, and show that this results in better model generalization. STAR is compact, generalizes better to new bodies and is a drop-in replacement for SMPL. STAR is publicly available for research purposes at http://star.is.tue.mpg.de",

To boost the transfer stability across frames, optical flow is widely adopted, despite its high computational complexity, e.g., occupying over 97% inference time. This paper proposes to learn a lightweight video style transfer network via knowledge distillation paradigm. We adopt two teacher networks, one of which takes optical flow during inference while the other does not. The output difference between these two teacher networks highlights the improvements made by optical flow, which is then adopted to distill the target student network. Furthermore, a low-rank distillation loss is employed to stabilize the output of student network by mimicking the rank of input videos. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our student network without an optical flow module is still able to generate stable video and runs much faster than the teacher network",

To this end, we propose a self-coordinate knowledge amalgamation network (SOKA-Net) for learning the multi-talent student model. This is achieved via a dual-step adaptive competitive-cooperation training approach, where the knowledge of the heterogeneous teachers are in the first step amalgamated to guide the shared parameter learning of the student network, and followed by a gradient-based competition-balancing strategy to learn the multi-head prediction network as well as the loss weightings of the distinct tasks in the second step. The two steps, which we term as the collaboration and competition step respectively, are performed alternatively until the balance of the competition is reached for the ultimate collaboration.

For this task, several problems such as obstacle avoidance, motion planning, and actuator control have been extensively studied in robotics. However, when it comes to task specification, the space of possibilities remains under-explored. Towards this end, we introduce a novel problem,single-image-guided 3D part assembly, along with a learning-based solution. We study this problem in the setting of furniture assembly from a given complete set of parts and a single image depicting the entire assembled object. Multiple challenges exist in this setting, including handling ambiguity among parts (e.g., slats in a chair back and leg stretchers) and 3D pose prediction for parts and part subassemblies,whether visible or occluded. We address these issues by proposing a two-module pipeline that leverages strong 2D-3D correspondences and assembly-oriented graph message-passing to infer part relationships. In experiments with a PartNet-based synthetic benchmark, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework as compared with three baseline approaches",

    "abstract": "Generative 3D shape modeling is a fundamental research area in computer vision and interactive computer graphics, with many real-world applications. This paper investigates the novel problem of generating a 3D point cloud geometry for a shape from a symbolic part tree representation. In order to learn such a conditional shape generation procedure in an end-to-end fashion, we propose a conditional GAN “part tree”-to-“point cloud” model (PT2PC) that disentangles the structural and geometric factors. The proposed model incorporates the part tree condition into the architecture design by passing messages top-down and bottom-up along the part tree hierarchy. Experimental results and user study demonstrate the strengths of our method in generating perceptually plausible and diverse 3D point clouds, given the part tree condition. We also propose a novel structural measure for evaluating if the generated shape point clouds satisfy the part tree conditions",

    "abstract": "Salient object detection models often demand a considerable amount of computation cost to make precise prediction for each pixel, making them hardly applicable on low-power devices. In this paper, we aim to relieve the contradiction between computation cost and model performance by improving the network efficiency to a higher degree. We propose a flexible convolutional module, namely generalized OctConv (gOctConv), to efficiently utilize both in-stage and cross-stages multi-scale features, while reducing the representation redundancy by a novel dynamic weight decay scheme. The effective dynamic weight decay scheme stably boosts the sparsity of parameters during training, supports learnable number of channels for each scale in gOctConv, allowing 80% of parameters reduce with negligible performance drop. Utilizing gOctConv, we build an extremely light-weighted model, namely CSNet, which achieves comparable performance with about 0.2% parameters (100k) of large models on popular salient object detection benchmarks.

Most existing aging methods are limited to changing the texture, overlooking transformations in head shape that occur during the human aging and growth process. This limits the applicability of previous methods to aging of adults to slightly older adults, and application of those methods to photos of children does not produce quality results. We propose a new multi domain image-to-image generative adversarial network architecture, whose learned latent space accurately models the continuous aging process in both directions. The network is trained on the FFHQ dataset, which we labeled for ages, gender, and semantic segmentation, where fixed age classes are used as anchors to approximate the continuous age transformation. Our framework can predict a full head portrait in ages 0-70 from a single photo, modifying both texture and shape of the head. We demonstrate results on a wide variety of photos and datasets, and show significant improvement over the state of the art",

Between synthetic and real data, there is a two-level domain gap, i.e., content level and appearance level. While the latter has been widely studied, we focus on reducing the content gap in attributes like illumination and viewpoint. To reduce the problem complexity, we choose a smaller and more controllable application, vehicle re-identification (re-ID). We introduce a large-scale synthetic dataset VehicleX. Created in Unity, it contains 1,362 vehicles of various 3D models with fully editable attributes. We propose an attribute descent approach to let VehicleX approximate the attributes in real-world datasets. Specifically, we manipulate each attribute in VehicleX, aiming to minimize the discrepancy between VehicleX and real data in terms of the Fr ́echet Inception Distance (FID). This attribute descent algorithm allows content domain adaptation (DA) orthogonal to existing appearance DA methods. We mix the optimized VehicleX data with real-world vehicle re-ID datasets, and observe consistent improvement. With the augmented datasets, we report competitive accuracy.

    "title": "Multiview Detection with Feature Perspective Transformation",
    "abstract": "Incorporating multiple camera views for detection alleviates the impact of occlusions in crowded scenes. In a multiview detection system, we need to answer two important questions. First, how should we aggregate cues from multiple views? Second, how should we aggregate information from spatially neighboring locations? To address these questions, we introduce a novel multiview detector, MVDet. During multiview aggregation, for each location on the ground, existing methods use multiview anchor box features as representation, which potentially limits performance as pre-defined anchor boxes can be inaccurate. In contrast, via feature map perspective transformation, MVDet employs anchor-free representations with feature vectors directly sampled from corresponding pixels in multiple views. For spatial aggregation, different from previous methods that require design and operations outside of neural networks, MVDet takes a fully convolutional approach with large convolutional kernels on the multiview aggregated feature map. The proposed model is end-to-end learnable and achieves 88.2% MODA on Wildtrack dataset, outperforming the state-of-the-art by 14.1%. We also provide detailed analysis of MVDet on a newly introduced synthetic dataset, MultiviewX, which allows us to control the level of occlusion.

    "abstract": "We consider the problem of semi-supervised 3D action recognition which has been rarely explored before. Its major challenge lies in how to effectively learn motion representations from unlabeled data. Self-supervised learning (SSL) has been proved very effective at learning representations from unlabeled data in the image domain. However, few effective self-supervised approaches exist for 3D action recognition, and directly applying SSL for semi-supervised learning suffers from misalignment of representations learned from SSL and supervised learning tasks. To address these issues, we present Adversarial Self-Supervised Learning (ASSL), a novel framework that tightly couples SSL and the semi-supervised scheme via neighbor relation exploration and adversarial learning. Specifically, we design an effective SSL scheme to improve the discrimination capability of learned representations for 3D action recognition, through exploring the data relations within a neighborhood. We further propose an adversarial regularization to align the feature distributions of labeled and unlabeled samples. To demonstrate effectiveness of the proposed ASSL in semi-supervised 3D action recognition, we conduct extensive experiments on NTU and N-UCLA datasets. The results confirm its advantageous performance over state-of-the-art semi-supervised methods in the few label regime for 3D action recognition",

    "title": "Across Scales & Across Dimensions: Temporal Super-Resolution using Deep Internal Learning",
    "abstract": "When a very fast dynamic event is recorded with a low-framerate camera, the resulting video suffers from severe motion blur (due to exposure time) and motion aliasing (due to low sampling rate in time). True Temporal Super-Resolution (TSR) is more than just Temporal-Interpolation (increasing framerate). It can also recover new high temporal frequencies beyond the temporal Nyquist limit of the input video, thus resolving both motion-blur and motion aliasing – effects that temporal frame interpolation (as sophisticated as it may be) cannot undo. In this paper we propose a “Deep Internal Learning” approach for true TSR. We train a video-specific FCN on examples extracted directly from the low-framerate input video. Our method exploits the strong recurrence of small space-time patches inside a single video sequence, both within and across different spatio-temporal scales of the video.We further observe (for the first time) that small space-time patches recur also across-dimensions of the video sequence – i.e., by swapping the spatial and temporal dimensions. In particular, the higher spatial resolution of video frames provides strong examples as to how to increase the temporal resolution of that video. Such internal video-specific examples give rise to strong self-supervision, requiring no data but the input video itself. This results in Zero-Shot Temporal-SR of complex videos, which removes both motion blur and motion aliasing, outperforming previous supervised methods trained on external video datasets",

    "abstract": "Conditional GANs (cGANs) are widely used in translating an image from one category to another. Meaningful conditions on GANsprovide greater flexibility and control over the nature of the target domain synthetic data. Existing conditional GANs commonly encode target domain label information as hard-coded categorical vectors in the form of0s and 1s. The major drawbacks of such representations are inability to encode the high-order semantic information of target categories and their relative dependencies. We propose a novel end-to-end learning framework based on Graph Convolutional Networks to learn the attribute representations to condition the generator. The GAN losses, the discriminator and attribute classification loss, are fed back to the graph resulting in the synthetic images that are more natural and clearer with respect to the attributes generation. Moreover, prior-arts are mostly given priorities to condition on the generator side, not on the discriminator side of GANs.We apply the conditions on the discriminator side as well via multi-task learning. We enhanced four state-of-the-art cGANs architectures: Stargan, Stargan-JNT, AttGAN and STGAN. Our extensive qualitative and quantitative evaluations on challenging face attributes manipulation data set,CelebA, LFWA, and RaFD, show that the cGANs enhanced by our meth-ods outperform by a large margin, compared to their counter-parts and other conditioning methods, in terms of both target attributes recognition rates and quality measures such as PSNR and SSIM",

The refinement process is guided by a consistency loss, which combines stereo and temporal photo-consistency with a geometric term that couples disparity and 3D motion. To handle inherent modeling error in the consistency loss (e.g. Lambertian assumptions) and for better generalization, we further introduce a learned, output refinement network, which takes the initial predictions, the loss, and the gradient as input, and efficiently predicts a correlated output update.

These outputs can either be low-dimensional features for representation learning or output clusters corresponding to semantic labels for clustering. While masked convolutions are used during training, in inference, no masking is applied and we fall back to the standard convolution where the model has access to the full input.

We propose a circular and confocal non-line-of-sight (C$^2$NLOS) scan that involves illuminating and imaging a common point, and scanning this point in a circular path along a wall. We observe that (1) these C$^2$NLOS measurements consist of a superposition of sinusoids, which we refer to as a transient sinogram, (2) there exists computationally efficient reconstruction procedures that transform these sinusoidal measurements into 3D positions of hidden scatterers or NLOS images of hidden objects, and (3) despite operating on an order of magnitude fewer measurements than previous approaches, these C$^2$NLOS scans provide sufficient information about the hidden scene to solve these different NLOS imaging tasks.

However, previous single image super-resolution (SISR) methods would either lose textural details or introduce unpleasing artifacts. On the other hand, reference-based SR (Ref-SR) methods can transfer textures to some extent, but is still impractical to handle very large factors and keep fidelity with original input. To solve these problems, we propose an efficient high-resolution hallucination network for very large scaling factors with efficient network structure and feature transferring. To transfer more detailed textures, we design a wavelet texture loss, which helps to enhance more high-frequency components. At the same time, to reduce the smoothing effect brought by the image reconstruction loss, we further relax the reconstruction constraint with a degradation loss which ensures the consistency between downscaled super-resolution results and low-resolution inputs. We also collected a high-resolution (g 4K resolution) painting dataset PaintHD by considering both physical size and image resolution.

Specifically, we feed the network with the sequential joints encoded with the temporal information for spatial and temporal explorations. Second, to further exploit the inherent kinematic chains for better 3D structures, we apply a progressive-decoding strategy, which performs in a central-to-peripheral extension according to the structural connectivity. Last, in order to incorporate a general motion space for high-quality prediction, we build a memory-based dictionary, which aims to preserve the global motion patterns in training data to guide the predictions. We evaluate the proposed method on two challenging benchmark datasets (Human3.6M and CMU-Mocap). Experimental results show our superior performance compared with the state-of-the-art approaches",

Despite the high complexity of RS geometry, we focus in this paper on a special yet common input --- two consecutive frames from a video stream, wherein the inter-frame motion is restricted from being arbitrarily large. This allows us to adopt simpler differential motion model, leading to a straightforward and practical minimal solver. To deal with non-planar scene and camera parallax in stitching, we further propose an RS-aware spatially-varying homogarphy field in the principle of As-Projective-As-Possible (APAP). We show superior performance over state-of-the-art methods both in RS image stitching and rectification, especially for images captured by hand-held shaking cameras",

    "abstract": "Deep metric learning has yielded impressive results in tasks such as clustering and image retrieval by leveraging neural networks to obtain highly discriminative feature embeddings, which can be used to group samples into different classes. Much research has been devoted to the design of smart loss functions or data mining strategies for training such networks. Most methods consider only pairs or triplets of samples within a mini-batch to compute the loss function, which is commonly based on the distance between embeddings. We propose Group Loss, a loss function based on a differentiable label-propagation method that enforces embedding similarity across all samples of a group while promoting, at the same time, low-density regions amongst data points belonging to different groups. Guided by the smoothness assumption that ``\"\"similar objects should belong to the same group\"\", the proposed loss trains the neural network for a classification task, enforcing a consistent labelling amongst samples within a class. We show state-of-the-art results on clustering and image retrieval on several datasets, and show the potential of our method when combined with other techniques such as ensembles",

To leverage this progress in 3D applications, this paper addresses the problem of learning to estimate the depth of segmented objects given some measurement of camera motion (e.g., from robot kinematics or vehicle odometry). We achieve this by, first, introducing a diverse, extensible dataset and, second, designing a novel deep network that estimates the depth of objects using only segmentation masks and uncalibrated camera movement. Our data-generation framework creates artificial object segmentations that are scaled for changes in distance between the camera and object, and our network learns to estimate object depth even with segmentation errors.

    "abstract": "Data augmentation is one of the most important tools in training modern deep neural networks. Recently, great advances have been made in searching for optimal augmentation policies in the image classification domain. However, two key points related to data augmentation remain uncovered by the current methods. First is that most if not all modern augmentation search methods are extit{offline} where learning policies are isolated from their usage. The learned policies are mostly constant throughout the training process and are extit{not adapted} to the current training model state. Second, the policies rely on class-preserving image processing functions. Hence applying current offline methods to new tasks may require domain knowledge to specify such kind of operations. In this work, we offer an orthogonal extit{online} data augmentation scheme together with three new augmentation networks, co-trained with the target learning task. It is both more efficient, in the sense that it does not require expensive offline training when entering a new domain, and more adaptive as it adapts to the learner state. Our augmentation networks require less domain knowledge and are easily applicable to new tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed scheme alone performs on par with the state-of-the-art offline data augmentation methods, as well as improving upon the state-of-the-art in combination with those methods",

    "abstract": "Current state-of-the-art semantic segmentation methods usually require high computational resources for accurate segmentation. One promising way to achieve a good trade-off between segmentation accuracy and efficiency is knowledge distillation. In this paper, different from previous methods performing knowledge distillation for densely pairwise relations, we propose a novel intra-class feature variation distillation (IFVD) to transfer the intra-class feature variation (IFV) of the cumbersome model (teacher) to the compact model (student). Concretely, we compute the feature center (regarded as the prototype) of each class and characterize the IFV with the set of similarity between the feature on each pixel and its corresponding class-wise prototype. The teacher model usually learns more robust intra-class feature representation than the student model, making them have different IFV. Transferring such IFV from teacher to student could make the student mimic the teacher better in terms of feature distribution, and thus improve the segmentation accuracy. We evaluate the proposed approach on three widely adopted benchmarks: Cityscapes, CamVid and Pascal VOC 2012, consistently improving state-of-the-art methods",

    "abstract": "Motivated by the previous success of Two-Dimensional Convolutional Neural Network (2D CNN) on image recognition, researchers endeavor to leverage it to characterize videos. However, one limitation of applying 2D CNN to analyze videos is that different frames of a video share the same 2D CNN kernels, which may result in repeated and redundant information utilization, especially in the spatial semantics extraction process, hence neglecting the critical variations among frames. In this paper, we attempt to tackle this issue through two ways. 1) Design a sequential channel filtering mechanism, Progressive Enhancement Module (PEM), to excite the discriminative channels of features from different frames step by step, and thus avoid repeated information extraction. 2) Create a Temporal Diversity Loss (TD Loss) to force the kernels to concentrate on and capture the variations among frames rather than the image regions with similar appearance. Our method is evaluated on the temporal reasoning datasets Something-Something V1 and V2, and it achieves visible improvements against the best competitor by 2.4% and 1.3%.

The locations of representative nodes come from a learned spatial offset matrix. The RepGraph layer is flexible to integrate into many visual architectures and combine with other operations. With the application of semantic segmentation, without any bells and whistles, our RepGraph network can compete or perform favourably against the state-of-the-art methods on three challenging benchmarks: ADE20K, Cityscapes, and PASCAL-Context datasets.

    "abstract": "We introduce a new problem of mph{retrieving} 3D models that are mph{deformable} to a given query shape and present a novel deep mph{deformation-aware} embedding to solve this retrieval task. 3D model retrieval is a fundamental operation for recovering a clean and complete 3D model from a noisy and partial 3D scan. However, given a finite collection of 3D shapes, even the closest model to a query may not be satisfactory. This motivates us to apply 3D model deformation techniques to adapt the retrieved model so as to better fit the query. Yet, certain restrictions are enforced in most 3D deformation techniques to preserve important features of the original model that prevent a perfect fitting of the deformed model to the query. This gap between the deformed model and the query induces mph{asymmetric} relationships among the models, which cannot be handled by typical metric learning techniques. Thus, to retrieve the best models for fitting, we propose a novel deep embedding approach that learns the asymmetric relationships by leveraging location-dependent egocentric distance fields. We also propose two strategies for training the embedding network. We demonstrate that both of these approaches outperform other baselines in our experiments with both synthetic and real data.

    "abstract": "We present an end-to-end 3D reconstruction of a scene by directly regressing a truncated signed distance function (TSDF) from a set of posed RGB images. Traditional approaches to 3D reconstruction rely on an intermediate representation of depth maps prior to estimating a full 3D model of a scene. We hypothesize that a direct regression to 3D is more effective. A 2D CNN extracts features from each image independently which are then back-projected and accumulated into a voxel volume using the camera intrinsics and extrinsics. After accumulation, a 3D CNN refines the accumulated features and predicts the TSDF values. Additionally, semantic segmentation of the 3D model is obtained without significant computation. This approach is evaluated on Scannet dataset where we significantly outperform state-of-the-art baselines (deep multiview stereo followed by traditional TSDF fusion) both quantitatively and qualitatively. We compare our 3D semantic segmentation to prior methods that use a depth sensor since no previous work attempts the problem with only RGB input",

To this end, we consider the problem of multiple class novelty detection under dataset distribution shift to improve the novelty detection performance. Firstly, we discuss the problem setting in detail and show how it affects the performance of current novelty detection methods. Secondly, we show that one could improve those novelty detection methods with a simple integration of domain adversarial loss. Finally, we propose a method which brings together the techniques from novelty detection and domain adaptation to improve generalization of multiple class novelty detection on different domains.

    "title": "Colorization of Depth Map via Disentanglement",
    "abstract": "Vision perception is one of the most important components for a computer or robot to understand the surrounding scene and achieve autonomous applications. However, most of the vision models are based on the RGB sensors, which in general are vulnerable to the insufficient lighting condition. In contrast, the depth camera, another widely-used visual sensor, is capable of perceiving 3D information and being more robust to the lack of illumination, but unable to obtain appearance details of the surrounding environment compared to RGB cameras. To make RGB-based vision models workable for the low-lighting scenario, prior methods focus on learning the colorization on depth maps captured by depth cameras, such that the vision models can still achieve reasonable performance on colorized depth maps. However, the colorization produced in this manner is usually unrealistic and constrained to the specific vision model, thus being hard to generalize for other tasks to use. In this paper, we propose a depth map colorization method via disentangling appearance and structure factors, so that our model could 1) learn depth-invariant appearance features from an appearance reference and 2) generate colorized images by combining a given depth map and the appearance feature obtained from any reference. We conduct extensive experiments to show that our colorization results are more realistic and diverse in comparison to several image translation baselines",

Whilst various outdoor benchmarks exist that target lighting, weather and seasonal changes, far less attention has been paid to appearance changes that occur indoors. This has led to a mismatch between popular indoor benchmarks, which focus on static scenes, and indoor environments that are of interest for many real-world applications. In this paper, we adapt 3RScan -- a recently introduced indoor RGB-D dataset designed for object instance re-localization -- to create RIO10, a new long-term camera re-localization benchmark focused on indoor scenes. We propose new metrics for evaluating camera re-localization and explore how state-of-the-art camera re-localizers perform according to these metrics. We also examine in detail how different types of scene change affect the performance of different methods, based on novel ways of detecting such changes in a given RGB-D frame.

While number of techniques have been proposed for FSL, several factors have emerged as most important for FSL performance, awarding SOTA even to the simplest of techniques. These are: the backbone architecture (bigger is better), type of pre-training on the base classes (meta-training vs regular multi-class, currently regular wins), quantity and diversity of the base classes set (the more the merrier, resulting in richer and better adaptive features), and the use of self-supervised tasks during pre-training (serving as a proxy for increasing the diversity of the base set). In this paper we propose yet another simple technique that is important for the few shot learning performance - a search for a compact feature sub-space that is discriminative for a given few-shot test task. We show that the Task-Adaptive Feature Sub-Space Learning (TAFSSL) can significantly boost the performance in FSL scenarios when some additional unlabeled data accompanies the novel few-shot task, be it either the set of unlabeled queries (transductive FSL) or some additional set of unlabeled data samples (semi-supervised FSL). Specifically, we show that on the challenging extit{mini}ImageNet and extit{tiered}ImageNet benchmarks, TAFSSL can improve the current state-of-the-art in both transductive and semi-supervised FSL settings by more than $5\\%$, while increasing the benefit of using unlabeled data in FSL to above $10\\%$ performance gain",

To efficiently simulate deformation, existing approaches represent 3D objects using polygonal meshes and deform them using skinning techniques.

    "abstract": "Despite considerable progress, state of the art image captioning models produce generic captions, leaving out important image details. Furthermore, these systems may even misrepresent the image in order to produce a simpler caption consisting of common concepts. In this paper, we first analyze both modern captioning systems and evaluation metrics through empirical experiments to quantify these phenomena. We find that modern captioning systems return higher likelihoods for incorrect distractor sentences compared to ground truth captions, and that evaluation metrics like SPICE can be 'topped' using simple captioning systems relying on object detectors. Inspired by these observations, we design a new metric (SPICE-U) by introducing a notion of uniqueness over the concepts generated in a caption. We show that SPICE-U is better correlated with human judgements compared to SPICE, and effectively captures notions of diversity and descriptiveness. Finally, we also demonstrate a general technique to improve any existing captioning model -- by using mutual information as a re-ranking objective during decoding. Empirically, this results in more unique and informative captions, and improves three different state-of-the-art models on SPICE-U as well as average score over existing metrics",

Although recent research has shown the benefits of SSL on large unlabeled datasets, its utility on small datasets is relatively unexplored. We find that SSL reduces the relative error rate of few-shot meta-learners by 4%-27%, even when the datasets are small and only utilizing images within the datasets. The improvements are greater when the training set is smaller or the task is more challenging. Although the benefits of SSL may increase with larger training sets, we observe that SSL can hurt the performance when the distributions of images used for meta-learning and SSL are different. We conduct a systematic study by varying the degree of domain shift and analyzing the performance of several meta-learners on a multitude of domains. Based on this analysis we present a technique that automatically selects images for SSL from a large, generic pool of unlabeled images for a given dataset that provides further improvements",

    "abstract": "The current spike of hyper-realistic faces artificially generated using deepfakes calls for media forensics solutions that are tailored to video streams and work reliably with a low false alarm rate at the video level. We present a method for deepfake detection based on a two-branch network structure that isolates digitally manipulated faces by learning to amplify artifacts while suppressing the high-level face content. Unlike current methods that extract spatial frequencies as a preprocessing step, we propose a two-branch structure: one branch propagates the original information, while the other branch suppresses the face content yet amplifies multi-band frequencies using a Laplacian of Gaussian (LoG) as a bottleneck layer. To better isolate manipulated faces, we derive a novel cost function that, unlike regular classification, compresses the variability of natural faces and pushes away the unrealistic facial samples in the feature space. Our two novel components show promising results on the FaceForensics++, Celeb-DF, and Facebook's DFDC preview benchmarks, when compared to prior work. We then offer a full, detailed ablation study of our network architecture and cost function. Finally, although the bar is still high to get very remarkable figures at a very low false alarm rate, our study shows that we can achieve good video-level performance when cross-testing in terms of video-level AUC",

    "abstract": "We propose a method to train a model so it can learn new classification tasks while improving with each task solved. This amounts to combining meta-learning with incremental learning. Different tasks can have disjoint classes, so one cannot directly align different classifiers as done in model distillation. On the other hand, simply aligning features shared by all classes does not allow the base model sufficient flexibility to evolve to solve new tasks. We therefore indirectly align features relative to a minimal set of anchor classes. Such indirect discriminant alignment (IDA) adapts a new model to old classes without the need to re-process old data, while leaving maximum flexibility for the model to adapt to new tasks. This process enables incrementally improving the model by processing multiple learning episodes, each representing a different learning task, even with few training examples. Experiments on few-shot learning benchmarks show that this incremental approach performs favorably compared to training the model with the entire dataset at once",

    "abstract": "Neural architecture search (NAS) methods have shown promising results discovering models that are both accurate and fast. For NAS, training a one-shot model has became a popular strategy to rank the relative quality of different architectures (child models) using a single set of shared weights. However, while one-shot model weights can effectively rank different network architectures, the absolute accuracies from these shared weights are typically far below those obtained from stand-alone training. To compensate, existing methods assume that the weights must be retrained, finetuned, or otherwise post-processed after the search is completed. These steps significantly increase the compute requirements and complexity of the architecture search and model deployment. In this work, we propose BigNAS, an approach that challenges the conventional wisdom that post-processing of the weights is necessary to get good prediction accuracies. Without extra retraining or post-processing steps, we are able to train a single set of shared weights on ImageNet and use these weights to obtain child models whose sizes range from 200 to 1000 MFLOPs. Our discovered model family, BigNASModels, achieve top-1 accuracies ranging from 76.5% to 80.9%, surpassing state-of-the-art models in this range including EfficientNets and Once-for-All networks without extra retraining or post-processing.

    "title": "Differentiable Hierarchical Graph Grouping for Multi-Person Pose Estimation",
    "abstract": "Multi-person pose estimation is challenging because it localizes body keypoints for multiple persons simultaneously. Previous methods can be divided into two streams, \\ie top-down and bottom-up methods. The top-down methods localize keypoints after human detection, while the bottom-up methods localize keypoints directly and then cluster/group them for different persons, which are generally more efficient than top-down methods. However, in existing bottom-up methods, the keypoint grouping is usually solved independently from keypoint detection, making them not end-to-end trainable and have sub-optimal performance. In this paper, we investigate a new perspective of human part grouping and reformulate it as a graph clustering task. Especially, we propose a novel differentiable Hierarchical Graph Grouping (HGG) method to learn the graph grouping in bottom-up multi-person pose estimation task. Moreover, HGG is easily embedded into main-stream bottom-up methods. It takes human keypoint candidates as graph nodes and clusters keypoints in a multi-layer graph neural network model. The modules of HGG can be trained end-to-end with the keypoint detection network and is able to supervise the grouping process in a hierarchical manner. To improve the discrimination of the clustering, we add a set of edge discriminators and macro-node discriminators. Extensive experiments on both COCO and OCHuman datasets demonstrate that the proposed method improves the performance of bottom-up pose estimation methods",

    "abstract": "Supervised person re-identification (ReID) often has poor scalability and usability in real-world deployments due to domain gaps and the lack of annotations for the target domain data. Unsupervised person ReID through domain adaptation is attractive yet challenging. Existing unsupervised ReID approaches often fail in correctly identifying the positive samples and negative samples through the distance-based matching/ranking. The two distributions of distances for positive sample pairs (Pos-distr) and negative sample pairs (Neg-distr) are often not well separated, having large overlap. To address this problem, we introduce a global distance-distributions separation (GDS) constraint over the two distributions to encourage the clear separation of positive and negative samples from a global view. We model the two global distance distributions as Gaussian distributions and push apart the two distributions while encouraging their sharpness in the unsupervised training process. Particularly, to model the distributions from a global view and facilitate the timely updating of the distributions and the GDS related losses, we leverage a momentum update mechanism for building and maintaining the distribution parameters (mean and variance) and calculate the loss on the fly during the training. Distribution-based hard mining is proposed to further promote the separation of the two distributions. We validate the effectiveness of the GDS constraint in unsupervised ReID networks. Extensive experiments on multiple ReID benchmark datasets show our method leads to significant improvement over the baselines and achieves the state-of-the-art performance",

    "abstract": "Most of the previous image-based 3D human pose and mesh estimation methods estimate parameters of the human mesh model from an input image. However, directly regressing the parameters from the input image is a highly non-linear mapping because it breaks the spatial relationship between pixels in the input image. In addition, it cannot model the prediction uncertainty, which can make training harder. To resolve the above issues, we propose I2L-MeshNet, an image-to-lixel (line+pixel) prediction network. The proposed I2L-MeshNet predicts the per-lixel likelihood on 1D heatmaps for each mesh vertex coordinate instead of directly regressing the parameters. Our lixel-based 1D heatmap preserves the spatial relationship in the input image and models the prediction uncertainty.

    "abstract": "Most of the recent deep learning-based 3D human pose and mesh estimation methods regress the pose and shape parameters of human mesh models, such as SMPL and MANO, from an input image. The first weakness of these methods is the overfitting to image appearance, due to the domain gap between the training data captured from controlled settings such as a lab, and in-the-wild data in inference time. The second weakness is that the estimation of the pose parameters is quite challenging due to the representation issues of 3D rotations. To overcome the above weaknesses, we propose Pose2Mesh, a novel graph convolutional neural network (GraphCNN)-based system that estimates the 3D coordinates of human {m mesh vertices} directly from the {m 2D human pose}. The 2D human pose as an input provides essential human body articulation information without image appearance. Also, the proposed system avoids the representation issues, while fully exploiting the mesh topology using GraphCNN in a coarse-to-fine manner.

    "abstract": "Guided refinement is a popular procedure of various image post-processing applications. It produces output image based on input and guided images. Input images are usually flawed estimates containing kinds of noises and outliers, which undermine the edge consistency between input and guided images. As improvements, they are refined into output images with similar intensities of input images and consistent edges of guided images. However, outliers are usually untraceable and simply treated as zero-mean noises, limiting the quality of such refinement. In this paper, we propose a general outlier detection method for guided refinement. We assume local linear relationship between output and guided images to express the expected edge consistency, based on which, the outlier likelihoods of input pixels are measured. The metric is termed as ALRe (anchored linear residual) since it is essentially the residual of local linear regression with an equality constraint exerted on the measured pixel. Valuable features of the ALRe are discussed. Its effectiveness is proven by applications and experiment",

    "abstract": "We are interested in reconstructing the mesh representation of object surfaces from a point cloud. Surface reconstruction is a prerequisite for down-stream applications such as rendering, collision avoidance for planning, animation, etc. However, the task is challenging if the input point cloud has a low resolution, which is common in real-world scenarios (e.g., from LiDAR or Kinect sensors). Existing learning-based mesh generative methods mostly predict the surface by first building a shape embedding that is at the whole object level, a design that causes issues in generating fine-grained details and generalizing to unseen categories. Instead, we propose to leverage the input point cloud as much as possible, by only adding connectivity information to existing points. Particularly, we predict which triplets of points should form faces. Our key innovation is a surrogate of local connectivity, calculated by comparing the intrinsic/extrinsic metrics. We learn to predict this surrogate using a deep point cloud network and then feed it to an efficient post-processing module for high-quality mesh generation. We demonstrate that our method can not only preserve details, handle ambiguous structures, but also possess strong generalizability to unseen categories by experiments on synthetic and real data",

DRealSR establishes a new SR benchmark with diverse real-world degradation processes, mitigating the limitations of conventional simulated image degradation. In general, the targets of SR vary with image regions with different low-level image components, e.g., smoothness preserving for flat regions, sharpening for edges, and detail enhancing for textures. Learning an SR model with conventional pixel-wise loss usually is easily dominated by flat regions and edges, and fails to infer realistic details of complex textures. We propose a Component Divide-and-Conquer (CDC) model and a Gradient-Weighted (GW) loss for SR. Our CDC parses an image with three components, employs three Component-Attentive Blocks (CABs) to learn attentive masks and intermediate SR predictions with an intermediate supervision learning strategy, and trains an SR model following a divide-and-conquer learning principle. Our GW loss also provides a feasible way to balance the difficulties of image components for SR. Extensive experiments validate the superior performance of our CDC and the challenging aspects of our DRealSR dataset related to diverse real-world scenarios.

Whilst deep residual networks such as ResNet and DenseNet have become the standard backbones for many computer vision tasks, the cutting-edge WSOD methods still rely on plain networks, e.g., VGG, as backbones. It is indeed not trivial to employ deep residual networks for WSOD, which even shows significant deterioration of detection accuracy and non-convergence. In this paper, we discover the intrinsic root with sophisticated analysis and propose a sequence of design principles to take full advantages of deep residual learning for WSOD from the perspectives of adding redundancy, improving robustness and aligning features. First, a redundant adaptation neck is key for effective object instance localization and discriminative feature learning. Second, small-kernel convolutions and MaxPool down-samplings help improve the robustness of information flow, which gives finer object boundaries and make the detector more sensitivity to small objects. Third, dilated convolution is essential to align the proposal features and exploit diverse local information by extracting high-resolution feature maps.

Near-light photometric stereo methods address near-light conditions but previous works are limited to over-simplified reflectances, such as Lambertian reflectance. The proposed method takes a hybrid approach of distant- and near-light models, where the surface normal of a small area (corresponding to a pixel) is computed locally with a distant light assumption, and the reconstruction error is assessed based on a near-light image formation model. This paper is the first work to solve unknown, spatially varying, diverse reflectances in near-light photometric stereo",

    "title": "Learning Visual Representations with Caption Annotations",
    "abstract": "Pretraining general-purpose visual features has become a crucial part of tackling many computer vision tasks. While one can learn such features on the extensively-annotated ImageNet dataset, recent approaches have looked at ways to allow for noisy, fewer, or even no annotations to perform such pretraining. Starting from the observation that captioned images are easily crawlable, we argue that this overlooked source of information can be exploited to supervise the training of visual representations. To do so, motivated by the recent progresses in language models, we introduce {m image-conditioned masked language modeling} (ICMLM) -- a proxy task to learn visual representations over image-caption pairs. ICMLM consists in predicting masked words in captions by relying on visual cues. To tackle this task, we propose hybrid models, with dedicated visual and textual encoders, and we show that the visual representations learned as a by-product of solving this task transfer well to a variety of target tasks. Our experiments confirm that image captions can be leveraged to inject global and localized semantic information into visual representations. Project website: https://europe.naverlabs.com/ICMLM",

    "title": "Solving Long-tailed Recognition with Deep Realistic Taxonomic Classifier",
    "abstract": "Long-tail recognition tackles the natural non-uniformly distributed data in real-world scenarios. While modern classifiers perform well on populated classes, its performance degrades significantly on tail classes. Humans, however, are less affected by this since, when confronted with uncertain examples, they simply opt to provide coarser predictions. Motivated by this, a deep realistic taxonomic classifier (Deep-RTC) is proposed as a new solution to the long-tail problem, combining realism with hierarchical predictions. The model has the option to reject classifying samples at different levels of the taxonomy, once it cannot guarantee the desired performance. Deep-RTC is implemented with a stochastic tree sampling during training to simulate all possible classification conditions at finer or coarser levels and a rejection mechanism at inference time. Experiments on the long-tailed version of four datasets, CIFAR100, AWA2, Imagenet, and iNaturalist, demonstrate that the proposed approach preserves more information on all classes with different popularity levels. Deep-RTC also outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in longtailed recognition, hierarchical classification, and learning with rejection literature using the proposed correctly predicted bits (CPB) metric",

The network seamlessly combines standard convolution neural network (CNN) with Attention Refinement Module (ARM) and Graph Convolution Network (GCN). By iteratively and hierarchically fusing the features across different layers of the CNN, our approach gains sufficient semantic information from the input image and pays special attention to the local boundaries with the help of ARM and GCN. In particular, thanks to the proposed aggregation GCN, our network benefits from direct feature learning of the instances’ boundary locations and the spatial information propagation across the image.

    "abstract": "We present an effective method to progressively integrate and refine the cross-modality complementarities for RGB-D salient object detection (SOD). The proposed network mainly solves two challenging issues: 1) how to effectively integrate the complementary information from RGB image and its corresponding depth map, and 2) how to adaptively select more saliency-related features. First, we propose a cross-modality feature modulation (cmFM) module to enhance feature representations by taking the depth features as prior, which models the complementary relations of RGB-D data. Second, we propose an adaptive feature selection (AFS) module to select saliency-related features and suppress the inferior ones. The AFS module exploits multi-modality spatial feature fusion with the self-modality and cross-modality interdependencies of channel features are considered. Third, we employ a saliency-guided position-edge attention (sg-PEA) module to encourage our network to focus more on saliency-related regions. The above modules as a whole, called cmMS block, facilitates the refinement of saliency features in a coarse-to-fine fashion. Coupled with a bottom-up inference, the refined saliency features enable accurate and edge-preserving SOD. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our network outperforms state-of-the-art saliency detectors on six popular RGB-D SOD benchmarks",

These designs include not only a new input pattern to improve the spatial utilization but also a novel learning objective to expand the effective receptive field of the pre-trained model.

    "title": "Faster Person Re-Identification",
    "abstract": "Fast person re-identification (ReID) aims to search person images quickly and accurately. The main idea of recent fast ReID methods is the hashing algorithm, which learns compact binary codes and performs fast Hamming distance and counting sort. However, a very long code is needed for high accuracy (e.g. 2048), which compromises search speed. In this work, we introduce a new solution for fast ReID by formulating a novel Coarse-to-Fine (CtF) hashing code search strategy, which complementarily uses short and long codes, achieving both faster speed and better accuracy. It uses shorter codes to coarsely rank broad matching similarities and longer codes to refine only a few top candidates for more accurate instance ReID. Specifically, we design an All-in-One (AiO) framework together with a Distance Threshold Optimization (DTO) algorithm. In AiO, we simultaneously learn and enhance multiple codes of different lengths in a single model. It learns multiple codes in a pyramid structure, and encourage shorter codes to mimic longer codes by self-distillation. DTO solves a complex threshold search problem by a simple optimization process, and the balance between accuracy and speed is easily controlled by a single parameter. It formulates the optimization target as a $F_{eta}$ score that can be optimised by Gaussian cumulative distribution functions. Experimental results on 2 datasets show that our proposed method (CtF) is not only 8% more accurate but also 5x faster than contemporary hashing ReID methods. Compared with non-hashing ReID methods, CtF is 50x faster with comparable accuracy. Code is available at https://github.com/wangguanan/light-reid",

However, most of their training data is constructed by 3D Morphable Model, whose space spanned is only a small part of the shape space. As a result, the reconstruction results lose the fine-grained geometry and look different from real faces. To alleviate this issue, we first propose a solution to construct large-scale fine-grained 3D data from RGB-D images, which are expected to be massively collected as the proceeding of hand-held depth camera. A new dataset Fine-Grained 3D face (FG3D) with 200k samples is constructed to provide sufficient data for neural network training. Secondly, we propose a Fine-Grained reconstruction Network (FGNet) that can concentrate on shape modification by warping the network input and output to the UV space. Through FG3D and FGNet, we successfully generate reconstruction results with fine-grained geometry.

    "abstract": "Event cameras are bio-inspired sensors that respond to per-pixel brightness changes in the form of asynchronous and sparse “events”. Recently, pattern recognition algorithms, such as learning-based methods, have made significant progress with event cameras by converting events into synchronous dense, image-like representations and applying traditional machine learning methods developed for standard cameras. However, these approaches discard the spatial and temporal sparsity inherent in event data at the cost of higher computational complexity and latency. In this work, we present a general framework for converting models trained on synchronous image-like event representations into asynchronous models with identical output, thus directly leveraging the intrinsic asynchronous and sparse nature of the event data. We show both theoretically and experimentally that this drastically reduces the computational complexity and latency of high-capacity, synchronous neural networks without sacrificing accuracy. In addition, our framework has several desirable characteristics: (i) it exploits spatial and temporal sparsity in the event data explicitly, (ii) it is agnostic to the event representation, network architecture, and task, and (iii) it does not require any train-time change, since it is compatible with the standard neural net-works’ training process. We thoroughly validate the proposed framework on two computer vision tasks: object detection and object recognition. In these tasks, we reduce the computational complexity up to 20 times with respect to high-latency neural networks.

Numerous studies over the past decade have demonstrated the feasibility of QIS for low-light imaging, but their usage for image classification has not been studied. This paper fills the gap by presenting a novel student-teacher learning scheme which allows us to classify the noisy QIS raw data.

To solve this problem, we propose a few-shot transfer learning paradigm for saliency prediction, which enables efficient transfer of knowledge learned from the existing large-scale saliency datasets to a target domain with limited labeled examples. Specifically, very few target domain examples are used as the reference to train a model with a source domain dataset such that the training process can converge to a local minimum in favor of the target domain. Then, the learned model is further fine-tuned with the reference. The proposed framework is gradient-based and model-agnostic. We conduct comprehensive experiments and ablation study on various source domain and target domain pairs. The results show that the proposed framework achieves a significant performance improvement.

    "abstract": "In this paper, we aim to develop an efficient and compact deep network for RGB-D salient object detection, where the depth image provides complementary information to boost performance in complex scenarios. Starting from a coarse initial prediction by a multi-scale residual block, we propose a progressively guided alternate refinement network to refine it. Instead of using ImageNet pre-trained backbone network, we first construct a lightweight depth stream by learning from scratch, which can extract complementary features more efficiently with less redundancy. Then, different from the existing fusion based methods, RGB and depth features are fed into proposed guided residual (GR) blocks alternately to reduce their mutual degradation. By assigning progressive guidance in the stacked GR blocks within each side-output, the false detection and missing parts can be well remedied. Extensive experiments on seven benchmark datasets demonstrate that our model outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches by a large margin, and also shows superiority in efficiency (71 FPS) and model size (64.9 MB)",

    "title": "Bottom-Up Temporal Action Localization with Mutual Regularization",
    "abstract": "Recently, temporal action localization (TAL), extit{i.e.}, finding specific action segments in untrimmed videos, has attracted increasing attentions of the computer vision community. State-of-the-art solutions for TAL involves evaluating the frame-level probabilities of three action-indicating phases, extit{i.e.} starting, continuing, and ending; and then post-processing these predictions for the final localization. This paper delves deep into this mechanism, and argues that existing methods, by modeling these phases as individual classification tasks, ignored the potential temporal constraints between them. This can lead to incorrect and/or inconsistent predictions when some frames of the video input lack sufficient discriminative information. To alleviate this problem, we introduce two regularization terms to mutually regularize the learning procedure: the Intra-phase Consistency (IntraC) regularization is proposed to make the predictions verified inside each phase; and the Inter-phase Consistency (InterC) regularization is proposed to keep consistency between these phases. Jointly optimizing these two terms, the entire framework is aware of these potential constraints during an end-to-end optimization process. Experiments are performed on two popular TAL datasets, THUMOS14 and ActivityNet1.3. Our approach clearly outperforms the baseline both quantitatively and qualitatively. The proposed regularization also generalizes to other TAL methods ( extit{e.g.}, TSA-Net and PGCN). code: https://github.com/PeisenZhao/Bottom-Up-TAL-with-MR",

Image-to-image translation approaches with disentangled representations have been shown effective for style transfer between two image categories.

For addressing this issue, this paper leverages domain-specific mappings for remapping latent features in the shared content space to domain-specific content spaces. This way, images can be encoded more properly for style transfer. Experiments show that the proposed method outperforms previous style transfer methods, particularly on challenging scenarios that would require semantic correspondences between images.

To this end, we propose and study multiple complementary learning tasks, targeting conceptually different data relationships by only resorting to the available training samples and labels of a standard DML setting.

    "title": "DHP: Differentiable Meta Pruning via HyperNetworks",
    "abstract": "Network pruning has been the driving force for the acceleration of neural networks and the alleviation of model storage/transmission burden. With the advent of AutoML and neural architecture search (NAS), pruning has become topical with automatic mechanism and searching based architecture optimization. Yet, current automatic designs rely on either reinforcement learning or evolutionary algorithm. Due to the non-differentiability of those algorithms, the pruning algorithm needs a long searching stage before reaching the convergence.  To circumvent this problem, this paper introduces a differentiable pruning method via hypernetworks for automatic network pruning. The specifically designed hypernetworks take latent vectors as input and generate the weight parameters of the backbone network. The latent vectors control the output channels of the convolutional layers in the backbone network and act as a handle for the pruning of the layers. By enforcing $ll_1$ sparsity regularization to the latent vectors and utilizing proximal gradient solver, sparse latent vectors can be obtained. Passing the sparsified latent vectors through the hypernetworks, the corresponding slices of the generated weight parameters can be removed, achieving the effect of network pruning. The latent vectors of all the layers are pruned together, resulting in an automatic layer configuration. Extensive experiments are conducted on various networks for image classification, single image super-resolution, and denoising. And the experimental results validate the proposed method.

With limited training data, fine-tuning methods may suffer from the overfitting issue and substantial accuracy loss. To alleviate these issues, we introduce transfer learning into network quantization to obtain an accurate low-precision model. Specifically, we propose a method named deep transferring quantization (DTQ) to effectively exploit the knowledge in a pre-trained full-precision model. To this end, we propose a learnable attentive transfer module to identify the informative channels for alignment.

Specifically, we disentangle the video representation into the temporal coherence and motion parts and randomly change the scale of the temporal motion features as the adversarial noise. The proposed AFA method is a general lightweight component that can be readily incorporated into various methods with negligible cost.

By a careful study, we find the root cause is that the ideal predictions are beyond the defined range. We design a new rotation detection baseline, to address the boundary problem by transforming angular prediction from a regression problem to a classification task with little accuracy loss, whereby high-precision angle classification is devised in contrast to previous works using coarse-granularity in rotation detection. We also propose a circular smooth label (CSL) technique to handle the periodicity of the angle and increase the error tolerance to adjacent angles. We further introduce four window functions in CSL and explore the effect of different window radius sizes on detection performance.

To mitigate this problem, self-labeled supervised loss $\\mathcal{L}_s$ is utilized together with webly supervised loss $\\mathcal{L}_w$ in recent works. $\\mathcal{L}_s$ relies on machine labels predicted by the model itself.

Learning to find an optimal mixed precision model that can preserve accuracy and satisfy the specific constraints on model size and computation is extremely challenge due to the difficult in training a mixed precision model and the huge space of all possible bit quantizations. In this paper, we propose a novel soft Barrier Penalty based NAS (BP-NAS) for mixed precision quantization, which ensures all the searched models are inside the valid domain defined by the complexity constraint, thus could return an optimal model under the given constraint by conducting search only one time. The proposed soft Barrier Penalty is differentiable and can impose very large losses to those models outside the valid domain while almost no punishment for models inside the valid domain, thus constraining the search only in the feasible domain. In addition, a differentiable Prob-1 regularizer is proposed to ensure learning with NAS is reasonable. A distribution reshaping training strategy is also used to make training more stable. BP-NAS sets new state of the arts on both classification (Cifar-10, ImageNet) and detection (COCO), surpassing all the efficient mixed precision methods designed manually and automatically. Particularly, BP-NAS achieves higher mAP (up to 2.7% mAP improvement) together with lower bit computation cost compared with the existing best mixed precision model on COCO detection",

Therefore, ADL may look very similar and often necessitate to look at their fine-grained details to distinguish them. Because the recent spatio-temporal 3D ConvNets are too rigid to capture the subtle visual patterns across an action, we propose a novel Video-Pose Network: VPN. The 2 key components of this VPN are a spatial embedding and an attention network. The spatial embedding projects the 3D poses and RGB cues in a common semantic space. This enables the action recognition framework to learn better spatio-temporal features exploiting both modalities. In order to discriminate similar actions, the attention network provides two functionalities - (i) an end-to-end learnable pose backbone exploiting the topology of human body, and (ii) a coupler to provide joint spatio-temporal attention weights across a video. Experiments show that VPN outperforms the state-of-the-art results for action classification on a large scale human activity dataset: NTU-RGB+D 120, its subset NTU-RGB+D 60, a real-world challenging human activity dataset: Toyota Smarthome and a small scale human-object interaction dataset Northwestern UCLA",

    "title": "Soft Anchor-Point Object Detection",
    "abstract": "Recently, anchor-free detection methods have been through great progress. The major two families, anchor-point detection and key-point detection, are at opposite edges of the speed-accuracy trade-off, with anchor-point detectors having the speed advantage. In this work, we boost the performance of the anchor-point detector over the key-point counterparts while maintaining the speed advantage. To achieve this, we formulate the detection problem from the anchor point's perspective and identify ineffective training as the main problem. Our key insight is that anchor points should be optimized jointly as a group both within and across feature pyramid levels. We propose a simple yet effective training strategy with soft-weighted anchor points and soft-selected pyramid levels to address the false attention issue within each pyramid level and the feature selection issue across all the pyramid levels, respectively. To evaluate the effectiveness, we train a single-stage anchor-free detector called Soft Anchor-Point Detector (SAPD). Experiments show that our concise SAPD pushes the envelope of speed/accuracy trade-off to a new level, outperforming recent state-of-the-art anchor-free and anchor-based detectors. Without bells and whistles, our best model can achieve a single-model single-scale AP of 47.4% on COCO",

    "title": "Beyond Fixed Grid: Learning Geometric Image Representation with a Deformable Grid",
    "abstract": "In modern computer vision, images are typically represented as a fixed uniform grid with some stride and processed via a deep convolutional neural network. We argue that deforming the grid to better align with the high-frequency image content is a more effective strategy. We introduce mph{Deformable Grid} (Defgrid), a learnable neural network module that predicts location offsets of vertices of a 2-dimensional triangular grid such that the edges of the deformed grid align with image boundaries. We showcase our Defgrid in a variety of use cases, i.e., by inserting it as a module at various levels of processing. We utilize Defgrid as an end-to-end mph{learnable geometric downsampling} layer that replaces standard pooling methods for reducing feature resolution when feeding images into a deep CNN. We show significantly improved results at the same grid resolution compared to using CNNs on uniform grids for the task of semantic segmentation. We also utilize Defgrid at the output layers for the task of object mask annotation, and show that reasoning about object boundaries on our predicted polygonal grid leads to more accurate results over existing pixel-wise and curve-based approaches. We finally showcase DefGrid as a standalone module for unsupervised image segmentation, showing superior performance over existing superpixel-based approaches.

There are scenarios where people are best to be split into sub-groups, which we call social groups, and each social group may be engaged in a different social activity.

    "abstract": "This paper investigates the task of 2D human whole-body pose estimation, which aims to localize dense landmarks on the entire human body including face, hands, body, and feet. As existing datasets do not have whole-body annotations, previous methods have to assemble different deep models trained independently on different datasets of the human face, hand, and body, struggling with dataset biases and large model complexity. To fill in this blank, we introduce COCO-WholeBody which extends COCO dataset with whole-body annotations. To our best knowledge, it is the first benchmark that has manual annotations on the entire human body, including 133 dense landmarks with 68 on the face, 42 on hands and 23 on the body and feet. A single-network model, named ZoomNet, is devised to take into account the hierarchical structure of the full human body to solve the scale variation of different body parts of the same person. ZoomNet is able to significantly outperform existing methods on the proposed COCO-WholeBody dataset. Extensive experiments show that COCO-WholeBody not only can be used to train deep models from scratch for whole-body pose estimation but also can serve as a powerful pre-training dataset for many different tasks such as facial landmark detection and hand keypoint estimation.

In this paper, we present a complete comprehensive study of the relative pose estimation problem for a calibrated camera constrained by known $\\mathrm{SE}(3)$ invariant, which involves 5 minimal problems in total. These problems reduces the minimal number of point pairs for relative pose estimation and improves the estimation efficiency and robustness. The $\\mathrm{SE}(3)$ invariant constraints can come from extra sensor measurements or motion assumption. Different from conventional relative pose estimation with extra constraints, no extrinsic calibration is required to transform the constraints to the camera frame. This advantage comes from the invariance of $\\mathrm{SE}(3)$ invariants cross different coordinate systems on a rigid body and makes the solvers more convenient and flexible in practical applications. Besides proposing the concept of relative pose estimation constrained by $\\mathrm{SE}(3)$ invariants, we present a comprehensive study of existing polynomial formulations for relative pose estimation and discover their relationship. Different formulations are carefully chosen for each proposed problems to achieve best efficiency.

    "abstract": "In recent years, Deep Neural Networks (DNN) have empowered Compressed Sensing (CS) substantially and have achieved high reconstruction quality and speed far exceeding traditional CS methods. However, there are still lots of issues to be further explored before it can be practical enough. There are mainly two challenging problems in CS, one is to achieve efficient data sampling, and the other is to reconstruct images with high-quality. To address the two challenges, this paper proposes a novel Runge-Kutta Convolutional Compressed Sensing Network (RK-CCSNet). In the sensing stage, RK-CCSNet applies Sequential Convolutional Module (SCM) to gradually compact measurements through a series of convolution filters. In the reconstruction stage, RK-CCSNet establishes a novel Learned Runge-Kutta Block (LRKB) based on the famous Runge-Kutta methods, reformulating the process of image reconstruction as a discrete dynamical system.

Prior methods take line detection as a special case of object detection, while neglect the inherent characteristics of lines, leading to less efficient and suboptimal results. We propose a one-shot end-to-end framework by incorporating the classical Hough transform into deeply learned representations. By parameterizing lines with slopes and biases, we perform Hough transform to translate deep representations to the parametric space and then directly detect lines in the parametric space. More concretely, we aggregate features along candidate lines on the feature map plane and then assign the aggregated features to corresponding locations in the parametric domain. Consequently, the problem of detecting semantic lines in the spatial domain is transformed to spotting individual points in the parametric domain, making the post-processing steps, i.e. non-maximal suppression, more efficient. Furthermore, our method makes it easy to extract contextual line features, that are critical to accurate line detection.

    "title": "3D Human Shape and Pose from a Single Low-Resolution Image with Self-Supervised Learning",
    "abstract": "3D human shape and pose estimation from monocular images has been an active area of research in computer vision, having a substantial impact on the development of new applications, from activity recognition to creating virtual avatars. Existing deep learning methods for 3D human shape and pose estimation rely on relatively high-resolution input images; however, high-resolution visual content is not always available in several practical scenarios such as video surveillance and sports broadcasting. Low-resolution images in real scenarios can vary in a wide range of sizes, and a model trained in one resolution does not typically degrade gracefully across resolutions. Two common approaches to solve the problem of low-resolution input are applying super-resolution techniques to the input images which may result in visual artifacts, or simply training one model for each resolution, which is impractical in many realistic applications. To address the above issues, this paper proposes a novel algorithm called RSC-Net, which consists of a Resolution-aware network, a Self-supervision loss, and a Contrastive learning scheme. The proposed network is able to learn the 3D body shape and pose across different resolutions with a single model. The self-supervision loss encourages scale-consistency of the output, and the contrastive learning scheme enforces scale-consistency of the deep features. We show that both these new training losses provide robustness when learning 3D shape and pose in a weakly-supervised manner. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the RSC-Net can achieve consistently better results than the state-of-the-art methods for challenging low-resolution images",

As such, many prior approaches focus on learning representations which persist across all source domains with the assumption that these domain agnostic representations will generalize well. However, often individual domains contain characteristics which are unique and when leveraged can significantly aid in-domain recognition performance. To produce a model which best generalizes to both seen and unseen domains, we propose learning domain specific masks. The masks are encouraged to learn a balance of domain-invariant and domain-specific features, thus enabling a model which can benefit from the predictive power of specialized features while retaining the universal applicability of domain-invariant features.

    "title": "DLow: Diversifying Latent Flows for Diverse Human Motion Prediction",
    "abstract": "Deep generative models are often used for human motion prediction as they are able to model multi-modal data distributions and characterize diverse human behavior. While much care has been taken into designing and learning deep generative models, how to efficiently produce diverse samples from a deep generative model after it has been trained is still an under-explored problem. To obtain samples from a pretrained generative model, most existing generative human motion prediction methods draw a set of independent Gaussian latent codes and convert them to motion samples. Clearly, this random sampling strategy is not guaranteed to produce diverse samples for two reasons: (1) The independent sampling cannot force the samples to be diverse; (2) The sampling is based solely on likelihood which may only produce samples that correspond to the major modes of the data distribution. To address these problems, we propose a novel sampling method, Diversifying Latent Flows (DLow), to produce a diverse set of samples from a pretrained deep generative model. Unlike random (independent) sampling, the proposed DLow sampling method samples a single random variable and then maps it with a set of learnable mapping functions to a set of correlated latent codes. The correlated latent codes are then decoded into a set of correlated samples. During training, DLow uses a diversity-promoting prior over samples as an objective to optimize the latent mappings to improve sample diversity. The design of the prior is highly flexible and can be customized to generate diverse motions with common features (e.g., similar leg motion but diverse upper-body motion). Our experiments demonstrate that DLow outperforms state-of-the-art baseline methods in terms of sample diversity and accuracy",

To solve this problem, we introduce 3D grids as intermediate representations to regularize unordered point clouds. We therefore propose a novel Gridding Residual Network (GRNet) for point cloud completion. In particular, we devise two novel differentiable layers, named Gridding and Gridding Reverse, to convert between point clouds and 3D grids without losing structural information. We also present the differentiable Cubic Feature Sampling layer to extract features of neighboring points, which preserves context information. In addition, we design a new loss function, namely Gridding Loss, to calculate the L1 distance between the 3D grids of the predicted and ground truth point clouds, which is helpful to recover details.

    "abstract": "Gait recognition aims at identifying different people by the walking patterns, which can be conducted at a long distance without the cooperation of subjects. A key challenge for gait recognition is to learn representations from the silhouettes that are invariant to the factors such as clothing, carrying conditions and camera viewpoints. Besides being discriminative for identification, the gait representations should also be compact for storage to keep millions of subjects registered in the gallery. In this work, we propose a novel network named Gait Lateral Network (GLN) which can learn both discriminative and compact representations from the silhouettes for gait recognition. Specifically, GLN leverages the inherent feature pyramid in deep convolutional neural networks to enhance the gait representations. The silhouette-level and set-level features extracted by different stages are merged with the lateral connections in a top-down manner. Besides, GLN is equipped with a Compact Block which can significantly reduce the dimension of the gait representations without hindering the accuracy. Extensive experiments on CASIA-B and OUMVLP show that GLN can achieve state-of-the-art performance using the $256$-dimensional representations.

    "abstract": "Recent reference-based face restoration methods have received considerable attention due to their great capability in recovering high-frequency details on real low-quality images. However, most of these methods require a high-quality reference image of the same identity, making them only applicable in limited scenes. To address this issue, this paper suggests a deep face dictionary network (termed as DFDNet) to guide the restoration process of degraded observations. To begin with, we use K-means to generate deep dictionaries for perceptually significant face components (i.e., left/right eyes, nose and mouth) from high-quality images. Next, with the degraded input, we match and select the most similar component features from their corresponding dictionaries and transfer the high-quality details to the input via the proposed dictionary feature transfer (DFT) block. In particular, component AdaIN is leveraged to eliminate the style diversity between the input and dictionary features (e.g., illumination), and a confidence score is proposed to adaptively fuse the dictionary feature to the input. Finally, multi-scale dictionaries are adopted in a progressive manner to enable the coarse-to-fine restoration. Experiments show that our proposed method can achieve plausible performance in both quantitative and qualitative evaluation, and more importantly, can generate realistic and promising results on real degraded images without requiring an identity-belonging reference.

    "title": "Inequality-Constrained and Robust 3D Face Model Fitting",
    "abstract": "Fitting 3D morphable models (3DMMs) on faces is a well-studied problem, motivated by various industrial and research applications. 3DMMs express a 3D facial shape as a linear sum of basis functions. The resulting shape, however, is a plausible face only when the basis coefficients take values within limited intervals. Methods based on unconstrained optimization address this issue with a weighted $ll_2$ penalty on coefficients; however, determining the weight of this penalty is difficult, and the existence of a unique weight that works universally is questionable. We propose a new formulation that does not require the tuning of any weight parameter. Specifically, we formulate 3DMM fitting as an inequality-constrained optimization problem, where the primary constraint is that basis coefficients should not exceed the interval that is learned when the 3DMM is constructed. We employ additional constraints to exploit sparse landmark detectors by enforcing the facial shape to be within the error bounds of a reliable detector. To enable operation ``in-the-wild'', we use a robust objective function, namely gradient correlation. Our approach performs comparably with deep learning (DL) methods on ``in-the-wild'' data, which have inexact ground truth, and better than DL methods on more controlled data with exact ground truth. Since our formulation does not require any learning, it enjoys a versatility that allows it to operate with multiple frames of arbitrary sizes. This study's results encourage further research on 3DMM fitting with inequality-constrained optimization methods, which remained unexplored compared to unconstrained methods",

In particular, we explore the effect of replacing the first layers of various deep architectures with Gabor layers (i.e. convolutional layers with filters that are based on learnable Gabor parameters) on robustness against adversarial attacks. We observe that architectures with Gabor layers gain a consistent boost in robustness over regular models and maintain high generalizing test performance. We then exploit the analytical expression of Gabor filters to derive a compact expression for a Lipschitz constant of such filters, and harness this theoretical result to develop a regularizer we use during training to further enhance network robustness. We conduct extensive experiments with various architectures (LeNet, AlexNet, VGG16, and WideResNet) on several datasets (MNIST, SVHN, CIFAR10 and CIFAR100) and demonstrate large empirical robustness gains. Furthermore, we experimentally show how our regularizer provides consistent robustness improvements",

    "abstract": "We study conditional image repainting where a model is trained to generate visual content conditioned on user inputs, and composite the generated content seamlessly onto a user provided image while preserving the semantics of users' inputs. The content generation community have been pursuing to lower the skill barriers. The usage of human language is the rose among horns for this purpose, because the language is friendly to users but poses great difficulties for the model in associating relevant words with the semantically ambiguous regions. To resolve this issue, we propose a delicate mechanism which bridges the semantic chasm between the language input and the generated visual content. The state-of-the-art image compositing techniques pose a latent ceiling of fidelity for the composited content during the adversarial training process. In this work, we improve the compositing by breaking through the latent ceiling using a novel piecewise value function. We demonstrate on two datasets that the proposed techniques can better assist tackling conditional image repainting compared to the existing ones",

    "title": "Learnable Cost Volume Using the Cayley Representation",
    "abstract": "Cost volume is an essential component of recent deep models for optical flow estimation and is usually constructed by calculating the inner product between two feature vectors. However, the standard inner product in the commonly-used cost volume may limit the representation capacity of flow models because it neglects the correlation among different channel dimensions and weighs each dimension equally. To address this issue, we propose a learnable cost volume (LCV) using an elliptical inner product, which generalizes the standard inner product by a positive definite kernel matrix. To guarantee its positive definiteness, we perform spectral decomposition on the kernel matrix and re-parameterize it via the Cayley representation. The proposed LCV is a lightweight module and can be easily plugged into existing models to replace the vanilla cost volume. Experimental results show that the LCV module not only improves the accuracy of state-of-the-art models on standard benchmarks, but also promotes their robustness against illumination change, noises, and adversarial perturbations of the input signals",

    "title": "HALO: Hardware-Aware Learning to Optimize",
    "abstract": "There has been an explosive demand for bringing machine learning (ML) powered intelligence into numerous Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices. However, the effectiveness of such intelligent functionality requires in-situ continuous model adaptation for adapting to new data and environments, while the on-device computing and energy resources are usually extremely constrained. Neither traditional hand-crafted (e.g., SGD, Adagrad, and Adam) nor existing meta optimizers are specifically designed to meet those challenges, as the former requires tedious hyper-parameter tuning while the latter are often costly due to the meta algorithms’ own overhead. To this end, we propose hardware-aware learning to optimize (HALO), a practical meta optimizer dedicated to resource-efficient on-device adaptation. Our HALO optimizer features the following highlights: (1) faster adaptation speed (i.e., taking fewer data or iterations to reach a specified accuracy) by introducing a new regularizer to promote empirical generalization; and (2) lower per-iteration complexity, thanks to a stochastic structural sparsity regularizer being enforced. Furthermore, the optimizer itself is designed as a very light-weight RNN and thus incurs negligible overhead. Ablation studies and experiments on five datasets, six optimizees, and two state-of-the-art (SOTA) edge AI devices validate that, while always achieving a better accuracy (↑0.46% - ↑20.28%), HALO can greatly trim down the energy cost (up to ↓60%) in adaptation, quantified using an IoT device or SOTA simulator.

    "abstract": "Recently, there has been growing interest in developing learning-based methods to detect and utilize salient semi-global or global structures, such as junctions, lines, planes, cuboids, smooth surfaces, and all types of symmetries, for 3D scene modeling and understanding. However, the ground truth annotations are often obtained via human labor, which is particularly challenging and inefficient for such tasks due to the large number of 3D structure instances (e.g., line segments) and other factors such as viewpoints and occlusions. In this paper, we present a new synthetic dataset, Structured3D, with the aim of providing large-scale photo-realistic images with rich 3D structure annotations for a wide spectrum of structured 3D modeling tasks. We take advantage of the availability of professional interior designs and automatically extract 3D structures from them. We generate high-quality images with an industry-leading rendering engine.

    "abstract": "The datasets of face recognition contain an enormous number of identities and instances. However, conventional methods have difficulty in reflecting the entire distribution of the datasets because a mini-batch of small size contains only a small portion of all identities. To overcome this difficulty, we propose a novel method called BroadFace, which is a learning process to consider a massive set of identities, comprehensively. In BroadFace, a linear classifier learns optimal decision boundaries among identities from a large number of embedding vectors accumulated over past iterations. By referring more instances at once, the optimality of the classifier is naturally increased on the entire datasets. Thus, the encoder is also globally optimized by referring the weight matrix of the classifier. Moreover, we propose a novel compensation method to increase the number of referenced instances in the training stage. BroadFace can be easily applied on many existing methods to accelerate a learning process and obtain a significant improvement in accuracy without extra computational burden at inference stage. We perform extensive ablation studies and experiments on various datasets to show the effectiveness of BroadFace, and also empirically prove the validity of our compensation method. BroadFace achieves the state-of-the-art results with significant improvements on nine datasets in 1:1 face verification and 1:N face identification tasks, and is also effective in image retrieval",

Accordingly, we derive a Temporal Reasoning Network (TRN) framework which models the implicit reasoning process as sequential planning in latent space. Our model is interpretable on both model design in probabilist and reasoning process via visualization. We experimentally demonstrate that TRN can support implicit reasoning across various datasets.

    "abstract": "We propose a novel framework for domain adaptation in semantic segmentation with image-level weak labels in the target domain. The weak labels may be obtained based on a model prediction for unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA), or from a human oracle in a new weakly-supervised domain adaptation (WDA) paradigm for semantic segmentation. Using weak labels is both practical and useful, since (i) collecting image-level target annotations is comparably cheap in WDA and incurs no cost in UDA, and (ii) it opens the opportunity for category-wise domain alignment. Our framework uses weak labels to enable the interplay between feature alignment and pseudo-labeling, improving both in the process of domain adaptation. Specifically, we develop a weak-label classification module to enforce the network to attend to certain categories, and then use such training signals to guide the proposed category-wise alignment method. In experiments, we show considerable improvements with respect to the existing state-of-the-arts in UDA and present a new benchmark in the WDA setting",

    "title": "Knowledge Distillation Meets Self-Supervision",
    "abstract": "Knowledge distillation, which involves extracting the \"\"dark knowledge\"\" from a teacher network to guide the learning of a student network, has emerged as an important technique for model compression and transfer learning. Unlike previous works that exploit architecture-specific cues such as activation and attention for distillation, here we wish to explore a more general and model-agnostic approach for extracting \"\"richer dark knowledge\"\" from the pre-trained teacher model. We show that the seemingly different self-supervision task can serve as a simple yet powerful solution. For example, when performing contrastive learning between transformed entities, the noisy predictions of the teacher network reflect its intrinsic composition of semantic and pose information. By exploiting the similarity between those self-supervision signals as an auxiliary task, one can effectively transfer the hidden information from the teacher to the student. In this paper, we discuss practical ways to exploit those noisy self-supervision signals with selective transfer for distillation. We further show that self-supervision signals improve conventional distillation with substantial gains under few-shot and noisy-label scenarios. Given the richer knowledge mined from self-supervision, our knowledge distillation approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on standard benchmarks, i.e., CIFAR100 and ImageNet, under both similar-architecture and cross-architecture settings. The advantage is even more pronounced under the cross-architecture setting, where our method outperforms the state of the art CRD by an average of 2.3% in accuracy rate on CIFAR100 across six different teacher-student pairs",

This is achieved by sparsifying the correlation tensor containing tentative matches, and its subsequent processing with a 4D CNN using submanifold sparse convolutions. Localisation accuracy is significantly improved by processing the input images in higher resolution, which is possible due to the reduced memory footprint, and by a novel two-stage correspondence relocalisation module.

    "abstract": "Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have been successfully used in many low-level vision problems like image denoising. Although the conditional image generation techniques have led to large improvements in this task, there has been little effort in providing conditional generative adversarial networks (cGANs) with an explicit way of understanding the image noise for object-independent denoising reliable for real-world applications. The task of leveraging structures in the target space is unstable due to the complexity of patterns in natural scenes, so the presence of unnatural artifacts or over-smoothed image areas cannot be avoided. To fill the gap, in this work we introduce the idea of a cGAN which explicitly leverages structure in the image noise variance space. By learning directly a low dimensional manifold of the image noise variance, the generator promotes the removal from the noisy image only that information which spans this manifold. This idea brings many advantages while it can be appended at the end of any denoiser to significantly improve its performance. Based on our experiments, our model substantially outperforms existing state-of-the-art architectures, resulting in denoised images with less oversmoothing and better detail",

    "abstract": "We present a new learning-based method for multi-frame depth estimation from a color video, which is a fundamental problem in scene understanding, robot navigation or handheld 3D reconstruction. While recent learning-based methods estimate depth at high accuracy, 3D point clouds exported from their depth maps often fail to preserve important geometric feature (e.g., corners, edges, planes) of man-made scenes. Widely-used pixel-wise depth errors do not specifically penalize inconsistency on these features. These inaccuracies are particularly severe when subsequent depth reconstructions are accumulated in an attempt to scan a full environment with man-made objects with this kind of features. Our depth estimation algorithm therefore introduces a Combined Normal Map (CNM) constraint, which is designed to better preserve high-curvature features and global planar regions. In order to further improve the depth estimation accuracy, we introduce a new occlusion-aware strategy that aggregates initial depth predictions from multiple adjacent views into one final depth map and occlusion probability map for the current reference view. With the CNM constraint and the occlusion-aware loss, our method outperforms the state-of-the-art in terms of depth estimation accuracy, and preserves essential geometric features of man-made indoor scenes much better than other algorithms",

    "abstract": "Supervised learning in large discriminative models is a mainstay for modern computer vision. Such an approach necessitates investing in large-scale human-annotated datasets for achieving state-of-the-art results. In turn, the efficacy of supervised learning may be limited by the size of the human annotated dataset. This limitation is particularly notable for image segmentation tasks, where the expense of human annotation is especially large, yet large amounts of unlabeled data may exist. In this work, we ask if we may leverage semi-supervised learning in unlabeled video sequences and extra images to improve the performance on urban scene segmentation, simultaneously tackling semantic, instance, and panoptic segmentation. The goal of this work is to avoid the construction of sophisticated, learned architectures specific to label propagation (e.g., patch matching and optical flow). Instead, we simply predict pseudo-labels for the unlabeled data and train subsequent models with both human-annotated and pseudo-labeled data. The procedure is iterated for several times. As a result, our Naive-Student model, trained with such simple yet effective iterative semi-supervised learning, attains state-of-the-art results at all three Cityscapes benchmarks, reaching the performance of 67.8% PQ, 42.6% AP, and 85.2% mIOU on the test set.

    "title": "SPL-MLL: Selecting Predictable Landmarks for Multi-Label Learning",
    "abstract": "Although significant progress achieved, multi-label classification is still challenging due to the complexity of correlations among different labels. Furthermore, modeling the relationships between input and some (dull) classes further increases the difficulty of accurately predicting all possible labels. In this work, we propose to select a small subset of labels as landmarks which are easy to predict according to input (predictable) and can well recover the other possible labels (representative). Different from existing methods which separate the landmark selection and landmark prediction in the 2-step manner, the proposed algorithm, termed Selecting Predictable Landmarks for MultiLabel Learning (SPL-MLL), jointly conducts landmark selection, landmark prediction, and label recovery in a unified framework, to ensure both the representativeness and predictableness for selected landmarks. We employ the Alternating Direction Method (ADM) to solve our problem. Empirical studies on real-world datasets show that our method achieves superior classification performance over other state-of-the-art methods",

    "title": "Unpaired Image-to-Image Translation using Adversarial Consistency Loss",
    "abstract": "Unpaired image-to-image translation is a class of vision problems whose goal is to find the mapping between different image domains using unpaired training data. Cycle-consistency loss is a widely used constraint for such problems. However, due to the strict pixel-level constraint, it cannot perform geometric changes, remove large objects, or ignore irrelevant texture. In this paper, we propose a novel adversarial-consistency loss for image-to-image translation. This loss does not require the translated image to be translated back to be a specific source image but can encourage the translated images to retain important features of the source images and overcome the drawbacks of cycle-consistency loss noted above. Our method achieves state-of-the-art results on three challenging tasks: glasses removal, male-to-female translation, and selfie-to-anime translation",

    "title": "Discriminability Distillation in Group Representation Learning",
    "abstract": "Learning group representation is a commonly concerned issue in tasks where the basic unit is a group, set, or sequence. Previously, the research community tries to tackle it by aggregating the elements in a group based on an extit{indicator} either defined by humans such as the extit{quality} and extit{saliency}, or generated by a black box such as the attention score. This article provides a more essential and explicable view. We claim the most significant indicator to show whether the group representation can be benefited from one of its element is not the quality or an inexplicable score, but the extit{discriminability w.r.t.} the model. We explicitly design the extit{discrimiability} using embedded class centroids on a proxy set. We show the discrimiability knowledge has good properties that can be distilled by a light-weight distillation network and can be generalized on the unseen target set. The whole procedure is denoted as extit{discriminability distillation learning} (DDL). The proposed DDL can be flexibly plugged into many group-based recognition tasks without influencing the original training procedures. Comprehensive experiments on various tasks have proven the effectiveness of DDL for both accuracy and efficiency. Moreover, it pushes forward the state-of-the-art results on these tasks by an impressive margin",

    "title": "Monocular Expressive Body Regression through Body-Driven Attention",
    "abstract": "To understand how people look, interact, or perform tasks, we need to quickly and accurately capture their 3D body, face, and hands together from an RGB image. Most existing methods focus only on parts of the body. A few recent approaches reconstruct full expressive 3D humans from images using 3D body models that include the face and hands. These methods are optimization-based and thus slow, prone to local optima, and require 2D keypoints as input. We address these limitations by introducing ExPose (EXpressive POse and Shape rEgression), which directly regresses the body, face, and hands, in SMPL-X format, from an RGB image. This is a hard problem due to the high dimensionality of the body and the lack of expressive training data. Additionally, hands and faces are much smaller than the body, occupying very few image pixels. This makes hand and face estimation hard when body images are downscaled for neural networks. We make three main contributions. First, we account for the lack of training data by curating a dataset of SMPL-X fits on in-the-wild images. Second, we observe that body estimation localizes the face and hands reasonably well. We introduce body-driven attention for face and hand regions in the original image to extract higher-resolution crops that are fed to dedicated refinement modules. Third, these modules exploit part-specific knowledge from existing face and hand-only datasets. ExPose estimates expressive 3D humans more accurately than existing optimization methods at a small fraction of the computational cost.

    "abstract": "Real-world image noise removal is a long-standing yet very challenging task in computer vision. The success of deep neural network in denoising stimulates the research of noise generation, aiming at synthesizing more pairs of clean-noisy images to facilitate the training of deep. In this work, we propose a novel unified framework to simultaneously deal with the noise removal and noise generation tasks. Instead of only inferring the posterior distribution of the latent clean image conditioned on the observed noisy image in traditional MAP framework, it learns the joint distribution of the clean-noisy image pairs. Specifically, we approximate the joint distribution with two different factorized forms, which can be formulated as a denoiser mapping the noisy image to the clean one and a generator mapping the clean to the noisy one. The learned joint distribution implicitly contains all the information between the noisy and clean images, avoiding the necessity of manually designing the image priors and noise assumptions as traditional. Besides, the performance of our denoiser can be further improved by augmenting the original training dataset with the learned generator. Moreover, we propose two metrics to assess the quality of the generated noisy image, for which, to the best of our knowledge, such metrics are first proposed along this research line. Extensive experiments have conducted to demonstrate the superiority of our method over the state-of-the-arts in terms of both the real noise removal and noise generation tasks",

Furthermore, differing quantities of data are typically available at each device (imbalance). In this work, we characterize the effect these real-world data distributions have on distributed learning, using as a benchmark the standard Federated Averaging (FedAvg) algorithm.

    "abstract": "To achieve robustness in Re-Identification, standard methods leverage tracking information in a Video-To-Video fashion. However, these solutions face a large drop in performance for single image queries (e.g., Image-To-Video setting). Recent works address this severe degradation by transferring temporal information from a Video-based network to an Image-based one. In this work, we devise a training strategy that allows the transfer of a superior knowledge, arising from a set of views depicting the target object. Our proposal - Views Knowledge Distillation (VKD) - pins this visual variety as a supervision signal within a teacher-student framework, where the teacher educates a student who observes fewer views. As a result, the student outperforms not only its teacher but also the current state-of-the-art in Image-To-Video by a wide margin (6.3% mAP on MARS, 8.6% on Duke-Video-ReId and 5% on VeRi-776).

    "abstract": "Defocus blur arises in images that are captured with a shallow depth of field due to the use of a wide aperture. Correcting defocus blur is challenging because the blur is spatially varying and difficult to estimate. We propose an effective defocus deblurring method that exploits data available on dual-pixel (DP) sensors found on most modern cameras. DP sensors are used to assist a camera's auto-focus by capturing two sub-aperture views of the scene in a single image shot. The two sub-aperture images are used to calculate the appropriate lens position to focus on a particular scene region and are discarded afterwards. We introduce a deep neural network (DNN) architecture that uses these discarded sub-aperture images to reduce defocus blur. A key contribution of our effort is a carefully captured dataset of 500 scenes (2000 images) where each scene has: (i) an image with defocus blur captured at a large aperture; (ii) the two associated DP sub-aperture views; and (iii) the corresponding all-in-focus image captured with a small aperture. Our proposed DNN produces results that are significantly better than conventional single image methods in terms of both quantitative and perceptual metrics -- all from data that is already available on the camera but ignored",

    "abstract": "Though many successful approaches have been proposed for recognizing events in short and homogeneous videos, doing so with long and complex videos remains a challenge. One particular reason is that events in long and complex videos can consist of multiple heterogeneous sub-activities (in terms of rhythms, activity variants, composition order, etc.) within quite a long period. This fact brings about two main difficulties: excessive/varying length and complex video dynamic/rhythm. To address this, we propose Rhythmic RNN (RhyRNN) which is capable of handling long video sequences (up to 3,000 frames) as well as capturing rhythms at different scales. We also propose two novel modules: diversity-driven pooling (DivPool) and bilinear reweighting (BR), which consistently and hierarchically abstract higher-level information. We study the behavior of RhyRNN and empirically show that our method works well even when mph{only event-level labels are available} in the training stage (compared to algorithms requiring sub-activity labels for recognition), and thus is more practical when the sub-activity labels are missing or difficult to obtain. Extensive experiments on several public datasets demonstrate that, even mph{without fine-tuning the feature backbones}, our method can achieve promising performance for long and complex videos that contain multiple sub-activities",

    "abstract": "We present an autoencoder-based semi-supervised approach to classify perceived human emotions from walking styles obtained from videos or motion-captured data and represented as sequences of 3D poses. Given the motion on each joint in the pose at each time step extracted from 3D pose sequences, we hierarchically pool these joint motions in a bottom-up manner in the encoder, following the kinematic chains in the human body. We also constrain the latent embeddings of the encoder to contain the space of psychologically-motivated affective features underlying the gaits. We train the decoder to reconstruct the motions per joint per time step in a top-down manner from the latent embeddings. For the annotated data, we also train a classifier to map the latent embeddings to emotion labels. Our semi-supervised approach achieves a mean average precision of 0.84 on the Emotion-Gait benchmark dataset, which contains both labeled and unlabeled gaits collected from multiple sources. We outperform current state-of-art algorithms for both emotion recognition and action recognition from 3D gaits by 7%-23% on the absolute.

In contrast to existing counting models that directly output count values, we divide one-step estimation into a sequence of much easier and more tractable sub-decision problems. Such sequential decision nature corresponds exactly to a physical process in reality|scale weighing. Inspired by scale weighing, we propose a novel ‘counting scale’ termed LibraNet where the count value is analogized by weight. By virtually placing a crowd image on one side of a scale, LibraNet (agent) sequentially learns to place appropriate weights on the other side to match the crowd count. At each step, LibraNet chooses one weight (action) from the weight box (the pre-defined action pool) according to the current crowd image features and weights placed on the scale pan (state). LibraNet is required to learn to balance the scale according to the feedback of the needle (Q values). We show that LibraNet exactly implements scale weighing by visualizing the decision process how LibraNet chooses actions. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our design choices and report state-of-the-art results on a few crowd counting benchmarks, including ShanghaiTech, UCF_CC_50 and UCF-QNRF.

    "abstract": "Recent studies have shown that DNNs can be compromised by backdoor attacks crafted at training time. A backdoor attack installs a backdoor into the victim model by injecting a backdoor pattern into a small set of training examples. The victim model behaves normally on clean test data, yet consistently predicts a specific (likely incorrect) target class whenever the backdoor pattern is present in an input example. While existing backdoor attacks are effective, they are not stealthy. The modifications made on training data or labels are often suspicious and can be easily detected by simple data filtering or human inspection. In this paper, we present a new type of backdoor attack inspired by an important natural phenomenon: reflection. Using mathematical modeling of physical reflection models, we propose reflection backdoor (Refool) to plant reflections as backdoor into a victim model. We demonstrate on 3 computer vision tasks and 5 datasets that, Refool can attack state-of-the-art DNNs with high success rate, and is more resistant to state-of-the-art backdoor defenses than existing attacks",

To deal with domain shift, we learn domain-invariant representations by the proposed principle of meta variational information bottleneck, we call MetaVIB. MetaVIB is derived from novel variational bounds of mutual information, by leveraging the meta-learning setting of domain generalization. Through episodic training, MetaVIB learns to gradually narrow domain gaps to establish domain-invariant representations, while simultaneously maximizing prediction accuracy. We conduct experiments on three benchmarks for cross-domain visual recognition. Comprehensive ablation studies validate the benefits of MetaVIB for domain generalization.

Then depth first search is performed to update the overall pairwise matchings.

First, a self-supervised task from representation learning is employed to obtain semantically meaningful features. Second, we use the obtained features as a prior in a learnable clustering approach. In doing so, we remove the ability for cluster learning to depend on low-level features, which is present in current end-to-end learning approaches. Experimental evaluation shows that we outperform state-of-the-art methods by large margins, in particular +26.6% on CIFAR10, +25.0% on CIFAR100-20 and +21.3% on STL10 in terms of classification accuracy.

The GCN-inferred \"\"clean\"\" probability is then exploited as a relevance measure. Each noisy example is weighted by its relevance when learning a classifier for the end task. We evaluate our method on an extended version of a few-shot learning problem, where the few clean examples of novel classes are supplemented with additional noisy data.

    "title": "Object-and-Action Aware Model for Visual Language Navigation",
    "abstract": "Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) is unique in that it requires turning relatively general natural-language instructions into robot agent actions, on the basis of visible environments. This requires to extract value from two very different types of natural-language information. The first is object description (e.g., `table', `door'), each presenting as a tip for the agent to determine the next action by finding the item visible in the environment, and the second is action specification (e.g., `go straight', `turn left') which allows the robot to directly predict the next movements without relying on visual perceptions. However, most existing methods pay few attention to distinguish these information from each other during instruction encoding and mix together the matching between textual object/action encoding and visual perception/orientation features of candidate viewpoints. In this paper, we propose an Object-and-Action Aware Model (OAAM) that processes these two different forms of natural language based instruction separately. This enables each process to match object-centered/action-centered instruction to their own counterpart visual perception/action orientation flexibly. However, one side-issue caused by above solution is that an object mentioned in instructions may be observed in the direction of two or more candidate viewpoints, thus the OAAM may not predict the viewpoint on the shortest path as the next action. To handle this problem, we design a simple but effective path loss to penalize trajectories deviating from the ground truth path. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model and path loss, and the superiority of their combination with a 50% SPL score on the R2R dataset and a 40% CLS score on the R4R dataset in unseen environments, outperforming the previous state-of-the-art",

    "title": "A Comprehensive Study of Weight Sharing in Graph Networks for 3D Human Pose Estimation",
    "abstract": "Graph convolutional networks (GCNs) have been applied to 3D human pose estimation (HPE) from 2D body joint detections and have shown encouraging performance. One limitation of the vanilla graph convolution is that it models the relationships between neighboring nodes via a shared weight matrix. This is suboptimal for articulated body modeling as the relations between different body joints are different. The objective of this paper is to have a comprehensive and systematic study of weight sharing in GCNs for 3D HPE. We first show there are two different ways to interpret a GCN depending on whether feature transformation occurs before or after feature aggregation. These two interpretations lead to five different weight sharing methods, and three more variants can be derived by decoupling the self-connections with other edges. We conduct extensive ablation study on these weight sharing methods under controlled settings and obtain new conclusions that will benefit the community",

    "abstract": "Video super-resolution (VSR) aims to utilize multiple low-resolution frames to generate a high-resolution prediction for each frame. In this process, inter- and intra-frames are the key sources for exploiting temporal and spatial information. However, there are a couple of limitations for existing VSR methods. First, optical flow is often used to establish one-on-one temporal correspondences. But flow estimation itself is error-prone and hence largely affects the ultimate recovery result. Second, similar patterns existing in natural images are rarely exploited for the VSR task. Motivated by these findings, we propose a temporal multi-correspondence aggregation strategy to leverage most similar patches across frames, and also a cross-scale nonlocal-correspondence aggregation scheme to explore self-similarity of images across scales. Based on these two novel modules, we build an effective multi-correspondence aggregation network (MuCAN) for VSR. Our method achieves state-of-the-art results on multiple benchmark datasets. Extensive experiments justify the effectiveness of our method",

    "title": "Efficient Semantic Video Segmentation with Per-frame Inference",
    "abstract": "For semantic segmentation, most existing real-time deep mod-els trained with each frame independently may produce inconsistent results when tested on a video sequence. A few methods take the correlations in the video sequence into account, e.g., by propagating the results to the neighboring frames using optical flow or extracting frame representations using multi-frame information, which may lead to inaccurate results or unbalanced latency. In contrast, here we explicitly consider the temporal consistency among frames as extra constraints during training and process each frame independently in the inference phase. Thus no computation overhead is introduced for inference. Compact models are employed for real-time execution. To narrow the performance gap between compact models and large models, new temporal knowledge distillation methods are designed. Weighing among accuracy, temporal smoothness, and efficiency, our proposed method outperforms previous keyframe based methods and corresponding baselines which are trained with each frame independently on benchmark datasets including cityscapes and Camvid",

    "title": "Increasing the Robustness of Semantic Segmentation Models with Painting-by-Numbers",
    "abstract": "For safety-critical applications such as autonomous driving, CNNs have to be robust with respect to unavoidable image corruptions, such as image noise. While previous works addressed the task of robust prediction in the context of full-image classification, we consider it for dense semantic segmentation. We build upon an insight from image classification that output robustness can be improved by increasing the network-bias towards object shapes. We present a new training schema that increases this shape bias. Our basic idea is to alpha-blend a portion of the RGB training images with faked images, where each class-label is given a fixed, randomly chosen color that is not likely to appear in real imagery. This forces the network to rely more strongly on shape cues. We call this data augmentation technique \"\"Painting-by-Numbers''. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our training schema for DeepLabv3$+$ with various network backbones, MobileNet-V2, ResNets, and Xception, and evaluate it on the Cityscapes dataset. With respect to our 16 different types of image corruptions and 5 different network backbones, we are in 74% better than training with clean data. For cases where we are worse than a model trained without our training schema, it is mostly only marginally worse. However, for some image corruptions such as images with noise, we see a considerable performance gain of up to 25%",

    "title": "Deep Spiking Neural Network: Energy Efficiency Through Time based Coding",
    "abstract": "Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) are promising for enabling low-power event-driven data analytics. The best performing SNNs for image recognition tasks are obtained by converting a trained deep learning Analog Neural Network (ANN) composed of Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) activation to SNN consisting of Integrate-and-Fire (IF) neurons with \"\"proper\"\" firing thresholds. However, this has come at the cost of accuracy loss and higher inference latency due to lack of a notion of time. In this work, we propose an ANN to SNN conversion methodology that uses a time-based coding scheme, named Temporal-Switch-Coding (TSC), and a corresponding TSC spiking neuron model. Each input image pixel is presented using two spikes and the timing between the two spiking instants is proportional to the pixel intensity. The real-valued ReLU activations in ANN are encoded using the spike-times of the TSC neurons in the converted TSC-SNN. At most two memory accesses and two addition operations are performed for each synapse during the whole inference, which significantly improves the SNN energy efficiency. We demonstrate the proposed TSC-SNN for VGG-16, ResNet-20 and ResNet-34 SNNs on datasets including CIFAR-10 (93.63% top-1), CIFAR-100 (70.97% top-1) and ImageNet (73.46% top-1 accuracy). It surpasses the best inference accuracy of the converted rate-encoded SNN with 7-14.5 times lesser inference latency, and 30-60 times fewer addition operations and memory accesses per inference across datasets",

To address this issue, we propose a novel 3D object detection framework with dynamic information modeling. The proposed framework is designed in a coarse-to-fine manner. Coarse predictions are generated in the first stage via a voxel-based region proposal network. We introduce InfoFocus, which improves the coarse detections by adaptively refining features guided by the information of point cloud density.

Specifically, during training one branch performs traditional classification (referred to as global inference), and the other branch provides patch-level information to keep track of the class-specific activation patterns (referred to as local inference). Both global and local branch information are combined to train a novelty detection network, which is used during inference to identify novel classes.

Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that the learned pointwise features through our framework benefits various point cloud analysis tasks, e.g. partial shape registration and keypoint transfer.

In pool-based active learning, accessible unlabeled data are not used for model training in most conventional methods.

First, we exploit both labeled and unlabeled data using semi-supervised learning (SSL) to distill information from unlabeled data during the training stage. Second, we propose a consistency-based sample selection metric that is coherent with the training objective such that the selected samples are effective at improving model performance. We conduct extensive experiments on image classification tasks. The experimental results on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and ImageNet demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed method with limited labeled data, compared to the existing methods and the alternative AL and SSL combinations. Additionally, we also study an important yet under-explored problem -- ``When can we start learning-based AL selection?\"\".

    "abstract": "Instance Segmentation and Pose Estimation\",\"A recent approach for object detection and human pose estimation is to regress bounding boxes or human keypoints from a central point on the object or person. While this center-point regression is simple and efficient, we argue that the image features extracted at a central point contain limited information for predicting distant keypoints or bounding box boundaries, due to object deformation and scale/orientation variation. To facilitate inference, we propose to instead perform regression from a set of points placed at more advantageous positions. This point set is arranged to reflect a good initialization for the given task, such as modes in the training data for pose estimation, which lie closer to the ground truth than the central point and provide more informative features for regression. As the utility of a point set depends on how well its scale, aspect ratio and rotation matches the target, we adopt the anchor box technique of sampling these transformations to generate additional point-set candidates. We apply this proposed framework, called Point-Set Anchors, to object detection, instance segmentation, and human pose estimation. Our results show that this general-purpose approach can achieve performance competitive with state-of-the-art methods for each of these tasks",

Inspired by such artist-based modeling, we propose a two-step neural framework based on RL to learn 3D modeling policies. By taking actions and collecting rewards in an interactive environment, the agents first learn to parse a target shape into primitives and then to edit the geometry. To effectively train the modeling agents, we introduce a novel training algorithm that combines heuristic policy, imitation learning and reinforcement learning. Our experiments show that the agents can learn good policies to produce regular and structure-aware mesh models, which demonstrates the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed RL framework",

It has recently attracted attention focusing on designing complex convolutional neural networks (CNN) which make full use of both low level features and high level semantic information. The heavy networks used in these methods lead to low processing speed, resulting difficulty in applying to real-time applications. In this work, we propose novel perspectives on the DBD problem and design convenient approach to build a real-time cost-effective DBD model. First, we observe that the semantic information does not always relate to and sometimes mislead the blur detection. We start from the essential characteristics of the DBD problem and propose a data augmentation method accordingly to destroy the semantic information and enforce the model to learn image blur related features rather than the semantic features. A novel self-supervision training objective is proposed to enhance the model training consistency and stability. Second, by rethinking the relationship between defocus blur detection and salience detection, we identify two previously ignored but common scenarios, based on which we design a hard mining strategy to enhance the DBD model. By using the proposed techniques, our model that uses a slightly modified U-Net as backbone, improves the processing speed by more than 3 times and performs competitively against state of the art methods.

    "abstract": "Low-resolution text images are often seen in natural scenes such as documents captured by mobile phones. Recognizing low-resolution text images is challenging because they lose detailed content information, leading to poor recognition accuracy. An intuitive solution is to introduce super-resolution (SR) techniques as pre-processing. However, previous single image super-resolution (SISR) methods are trained on synthetic low resolution images (e.g.Bicubic down-sampling), which is simple and not suitable for real low-resolution text recognition. To this end, we propose a real scene text SR dataset, termed TextZoom. It contains paired real low-resolution and high-resolution images which are captured by cameras with different focal length in the wild. It is more authentic and challenging than synthetic data, as shown in Fig. 1. We argue improving the recognition accuracy is the ultimate goal for SceneText SR. In this purpose, a new Text Super-Resolution Network, termed TSRN, with three novel modules is developed. (1) A sequential residual block is proposed to extract the sequential information of the text images. (2) A boundary-aware loss is designed to sharpen the character boundaries.(3) A central alignment module is proposed to relieve the misalignment problem in TextZoom. Extensive experiments on TextZoom demonstrate that our TSRN largely improves the recognition accuracy by over 13%of CRNN, and by nearly 9.0% of ASTER and MORAN compared to synthetic SR data. Furthermore, our TSRN clearly outperforms 7 state-of-the-art SR methods in boosting the recognition accuracy of LR images in TextZoom. For example, it outperforms LapSRN by over 5% and 8%on the recognition accuracy of ASTER and CRNN. Our results suggest that low-resolution text recognition in the wild is far from being solved, thus more research effort is needed",

We make these two representations synergistic by introducing novel consistency losses that ensure that the surface created from the atlas aligns with the level-set of the implicit function. Our hybrid architecture outputs results which are superior to the output of the two equivalent single-representation networks, yielding smoother explicit surfaces with more accurate normals, and a more accurate implicit occupancy function. Additionally, our surface reconstruction step can directly leverage the explicit atlas-based representation. This process is computationally efficient, and can be directly used by differentiable rasterizers, enabling training our hybrid representation with image-based losses",

    "title": "Learning Disentangled Representations with Latent Variation Predictability",
    "abstract": "Latent traversal is a popular approach to visualize the disentangled latent representations. Given a bunch of variations in a single unit of the latent representation, it is expected that there is a change in a single factor of variation of the data while others are fixed. However, this impressive experimental observation is rarely explicitly encoded in the objective function of learning disentangled representations. This paper defines the variation predictability of latent disentangled representations. Given image pairs generated by latent codes varying in a single dimension, this varied dimension could be closely correlated with these image pairs if the representation is well disentangled. Within an adversarial generation process, we encourage variation predictability by maximizing the mutual information between latent variations and corresponding image pairs. We further develop an evaluation metric that does not rely on the ground-truth generative factors to measure the disentanglement of latent representations. The proposed variation predictability is a general constraint that is applicable to the VAE and GAN frameworks for boosting disentanglement of latent representations. Experiments show that the proposed variation predictability correlates well with existing ground-truth-required metrics and the proposed algorithm is effective for disentanglement learning",

    "title": "Deep Space-Time Video Upsampling Networks",
    "abstract": "Video super-resolution (VSR) and frame interpolation (FI) are traditional computer vision problems, and the performance have been improving by incorporating deep learning recently. In this paper, we investigate the problem of jointly upsampling videos both in space and time, which is becoming more important with advances in display systems. One solution for this is to run VSR and FI, one by one, independently. This is highly inefficient as heavy deep neural networks (DNN) are involved in each solution. To this end, we propose an end-to-end DNN framework for the space-time video upsampling by efficiently merging VSR and FI into a joint framework. In our framework, a novel weighting scheme is proposed to fuse input frames effectively without explicit motion compensation for efficient processing of videos. The results show better results both quantitatively and qualitatively, while reducing the computation time (x7 faster) and the number of parameters (30%) compared to baselines.

It is a challenging problem since (1) the identifying process is susceptible to over-fitting with limited samples of an object, and (2) the sample imbalance between a base (known knowledge) category and a novel category is easy to bias the recognition results. To solve these problems, we propose a method based on multi-modal knowledge discovery. First, we use the visual knowledge to help the feature extractors focus on different visual parts. Second, we design a classifier to learn the distribution over all categories. In the second stage, we develop three schemes to minimize the prediction error and balance the training procedure: (1) Hard labels are used to provide precise supervision. (2) Semantic textual knowledge is utilized as weak supervision to find the potential relations between the novel and the base categories. (3) An imbalance control is presented from the data distribution to alleviate the recognition bias towards the base categories.

Its accuracy is on par with the most accurate, time-consuming online-learning model, while its speed is similar to the fastest template-matching method with sub-optimal accuracy. The core component of the model is a novel global context module that effectively summarizes and propagates information through the entire video. Compared to previous approaches that only use one frame or a few frames to guide the segmentation of the current frame, the global context module uses all past frames. Unlike the previous state-of-the-art space-time memory network that caches a memory at each spatio-temporal position, the global context module uses a fixed-size feature representation. Therefore, it uses constant memory regardless of the video length and costs substantially less memory and computation. With the novel module, our model achieves top performance on standard benchmarks at a real-time speed",

As different scale and movement types of shots can express different emotions and contents, recognizing shots and their attributes is important to the understanding of movies as well as general videos. Classifying shot type is challenging due to the additional information required beyond the video content, such as the spatial composition of a frame and the video camera movement. To address these issues, we propose a learning framework Subject Guidance Network (SGNet) for shot type recognition. SGNet separates the subject and background of a shot into two streams, serving as maps to guide scale and movement type classification respectively. To facilitate shot type analysis and model evaluations, we build a large-scale dataset MovieShots, which contains 46K shots from 7K movie trailers with annotations of their scale and movement types.

A key stumbling block in making progress towards this goal is a lack of appropriate training data, stemming from the high complexity of sign annotation and a limited supply of qualified annotators. In this work, we introduce a new scalable approach to data collection for sign recognition in continuous videos. We make use of weakly-aligned subtitles for broadcast footage together with a keyword spotting method to automatically localise sign-instances for a vocabulary of 1,000 signs in 1,000 hours of video. We make the following contributions: (1) We show how to use mouthing cues from signers to obtain high-quality annotations from video data - the result is the BSL-1K dataset, a collection of British Sign Language (BSL) signs of unprecedented scale; (2) We show that we can use BSL-1K to train strong sign recognition models for co-articulated signs in BSL and that these models additionally form excellent pretraining for other sign languages and benchmarks---we exceed the state of the art on both the MSASL and WLASL benchmarks. Finally, (3) we propose new large-scale evaluation sets for the tasks of sign recognition and sign spotting and provide baselines which we hope will serve to stimulate research in this area",

Although several 3D hand reconstruction approaches leverage hand models as a strong prior to resolve ambiguities and achieve more robust results, most existing models account only for the hand shape and poses and do not model the texture. To fill this gap, in this work we present HTML, the first parametric texture model of human hands. Our model spans several dimensions of hand appearance variability (e.g. related to gender, ethnicity, or age) and only requires a commodity camera for data acquisition. Experimentally, we demonstrate that our appearance model can be used to tackle a range of challenging problems such as 3D hand reconstruction from a single monocular image. Furthermore, our appearance model can be used to define a neural rendering layer that enables training with a self-supervised photometric loss. We make our model publicly available",

    "abstract": "This paper proposes a self-supervised learning method for the person re-identification (re-ID) problem, where existing unsupervised methods usually rely on pseudo labels, such as those from video tracklets or clustering. A potential drawback of using pseudo labels is that errors may accumulate and it is challenging to estimate the number of pseudo IDs. We introduce a different unsupervised method that allows us to learn pedestrian embeddings from raw videos, without resorting to pseudo labels. The goal is to construct a self-supervised pretext task that matches the person re-ID objective. Inspired by the mph{data association} concept in multi-object tracking, we propose the extbf{Cyc}le extbf{As}sociation ( extbf{CycAs}) task: after performing data association between a pair of video frames forward and then backward, a pedestrian instance is supposed to be associated to itself. To fulfill this goal, the model must learn a meaningful representation that can well describe correspondences between instances in frame pairs. We adapt the discrete association process to a differentiable form, such that end-to-end training becomes feasible. Experiments are conducted in two aspects: We first compare our method with existing unsupervised re-ID methods on seven benchmarks and demonstrate CycAs' superiority. Then, to further validate the practical value of CycAs in real-world applications, we perform training on self-collected videos and report promising performance on the standard test sets",

    "title": "Towards Real-Time Multi-Object Tracking",
    "abstract": "Modern multiple object tracking (MOT) systems usually follow the tracking-by-detection paradigm. It has 1) a detection model for target localization and 2) an appearance embedding model for data association. Having the two models separately executed might lead to efficiency problems, as the running time is simply a sum of the two steps without investigating potential structures that can be shared between them. Existing research efforts on real-time MOT usually focus on the association step, so they are essentially real-time association methods but not real-time MOT system. In this paper, we propose an MOT system that allows target detection and appearance embedding to be learned in a shared model. Specifically, we incorporate the appearance embedding model into a single-shot detector, such that the model can simultaneously output detections and the corresponding embeddings. We further propose a simple and fast association method that works in conjunction with the joint model. In both components the computation cost is significantly reduced compared with former MOT systems, resulting in a neat and fast baseline for future follow-ups on real-time MOT algorithm design. To our knowledge, this work reports the first (near) real-time MOT system, with a running speed of 22 to 40 FPS depending on the input resolution. Meanwhile, its tracking accuracy is comparable to the state-of-the-art trackers embodying separate detection and embedding (SDE) learning ($64.4\\%$ MOTA s $66.1\\%$ MOTA on MOT-16 challenge).

    "abstract": "This work addresses the unsupervised domain adaptation problem, especially in the case of class labels in the target domain being only a subset of those in the source domain. Such a partial transfer setting is realistic but challenging and existing methods always suffer from two key problems, negative transfer and uncertainty propagation. In this paper, we build on domain adversarial learning and propose a novel domain adaptation method BA$^3$US with two new techniques termed Balanced Adversarial Alignment (BAA) and Adaptive Uncertainty Suppression (AUS), respectively. On one hand, negative transfer results in misclassification of target samples to the classes only present in the source domain. To address this issue, BAA pursues the balance between label distributions across domains in a fairly simple manner. Specifically, it randomly leverages a few source samples to augment the smaller target domain during domain alignment so that classes in different domains are symmetric. On the other hand, a source sample would be denoted as uncertain if there is an incorrect class that has a relatively high prediction score, and such uncertainty easily propagates to unlabeled target data around it during alignment, which severely deteriorates adaptation performance. Thus we present AUS that emphasizes uncertain samples and exploits an adaptive weighted complement entropy objective to encourage incorrect classes to have uniform and low prediction scores. Experimental results on multiple benchmarks demonstrate our BA$^3$US surpasses state-of-the-arts for partial domain adaptation tasks. Code is available at \\url{https://github.com/tim-learn/BA3US}",

    "abstract": "Existing approaches for unsupervised metric learning focus on exploring self-supervision information within the input image itself. We observe that, when analyzing images, human eyes often compare images against each other instead of examining images individually. In addition, they often pay attention to certain keypoints, image regions, or objects which are discriminative between image classes but highly consistent within classes. Even if the image is being transformed, the attention pattern will be consistent. Motivated by this observation, we develop a new approach to unsupervised deep metric learning where the network is learned based on self-supervision information across images instead of within one single image. To characterize the consistent pattern of human attention during image comparisons, we introduce the idea of transformed attention consistency. It assumes that visually similar images, even undergoing different image transforms, should share the same consistent visual attention map. This consistency leads to a pairwise self-supervision loss, allowing us to learn a Siamese deep neural network to encode and compare images against their transformed or matched pairs. To further enhance the inter-class discriminative power of the feature generated by this network, we adapt the concept of triplet loss from supervised metric learning to our unsupervised case and introduce the contrastive clustering loss.

In particular, we model a video clip as a single 3D spatio-temporal volume, and propose a novel approach that segments and tracks instances across space and time in a single stage. Our problem formulation is centered around the idea of spatio-temporal embeddings which are trained to cluster pixels belonging to a specific object instance over an entire video clip. To this end, we introduce (i) novel mixing functions that enhance the feature representation of spatio-temporal embeddings, and (ii) a single-stage, proposal-free network that can reason about temporal context.

Our proposed method learns to model the motion of human by decomposing a long-range generation task in a hierarchical manner. Given the starting and ending states, a memory bank is used to retrieve motion references as source material for short-range clip generation. We first propose to explicitly disentangle the provided motion material into style and content counterparts via bi-linear transformation modelling, where diverse synthesis is achieved by free-form combination of these two components. The short-range clips are then connected to form a long-range motion sequence.

On large-scale skeleton dataset, we show that the proposed method is able to synthesise long-range, diverse and plausible motion, which is also generalizable to unseen motion data during testing.

    "title": "Explainable Face Recognition",
    "abstract": "Explainable face recognition (XFR) is the problem of explaining the matches returned by a facial matcher, in order to provide insight into why a probe was matched with one identity over another. In this paper, we provide the first comprehensive benchmark and baseline evaluation for XFR. We define a new evaluation protocol called the ``inpainting game'', which is a curated set of 3648 triplets (probe, mate, nonmate) of 95 subjects, which differ by synthetically inpainting a chosen facial characteristic like the nose, eyebrows or mouth creating an inpainted nonmate. An XFR algorithm is tasked with generating a network attention map which best explains which regions in a probe image match with a mated image, and not with an inpainted nonmate for each triplet. This provides ground truth for quantifying what image regions contribute to face matching. Finally, we provide a comprehensive benchmark on this dataset comparing five state-of-the-art XFR algorithms on three facial matchers. This benchmark includes two new algorithms called subtree EBP and Density-based Input Sampling for Explanation (DISE) which outperform the state-of-the-art XFR by a wide margin",

We propose a shadow removal method that can be trained using only shadow and non-shadow patches cropped from the shadow images themselves. Our method is trained via an adversarial framework, following a physical model of shadow formation. Our central contribution is a set of physics-based constraints that enables this adversarial training. Our method achieves competitive shadow removal results compared to state-of-the-art methods that are trained with fully paired shadow and shadow-free images. The advantages of our training regime are even more pronounced in shadow removal for videos. Our method can be fine-tuned on a testing video with only the shadow masks generated by a pre-trained shadow detector and outperforms state-of-the-art methods on this challenging test. We illustrate the advantages of our method on our proposed video shadow removal dataset",

    "title": "Diverse and Admissible Trajectory Prediction through Multimodal Context Understanding",
    "abstract": "Multi-agent trajectory forecasting in autonomous driving requires an agent to accurately anticipate the behaviors of the surrounding vehicles and pedestrians, for safe and reliable decision-making. Due to partial observability in these dynamical scenes, directly obtaining the posterior distribution over future agent trajectories remains a challenging problem. In realistic embodied environments, each agent's future trajectories should be both diverse since multiple plausible sequences of actions can be used to reach its intended goals, and admissible since they must obey physical constraints and stay in drivable areas. In this paper, we propose a model that synthesizes multiple input signals from the multimodal world|the environment's scene context and interactions between multiple surrounding agents|to best model all diverse and admissible trajectories. We compare our model with strong baselines and ablations across two public datasets and show a significant performance improvement over previous state-of-the-art methods.

    "abstract": "Our ability to sample realistic natural images, particularly faces, has advanced by leaps and bounds in recent years, yet our ability to exert fine-tuned control over the generative process has lagged behind. If this new technology is to find practical uses, we need to achieve a level of control over generative networks which, without sacrificing realism, is on par with that seen in computer graphics and character animation. To this end we propose ConfigNet, a neural face model that allows for controlling individual aspects of output images in semantically meaningful ways and that is a significant step on the path towards finely-controllable neural rendering. ConfigNet is trained on real face images as well as synthetic face renders. Our novel method uses synthetic data to factorize the latent space into elements that correspond to the inputs of a traditional rendering pipeline, separating aspects such as head pose, facial expression, hair style, illumination, and many others which are very hard to annotate in real data. The real images, which are presented to the network without labels, extend the variety of the generated images and encourage realism. Finally, we propose an evaluation criterion using an attribute detection network combined with a user study and demonstrate state-of-the-art individual control over attributes in the output images",

The key technical challenge is how to learn structured and plannable state and action spaces directly from unstructured real videos. We address this challenge by proposing Dual Dynamics Networks (DDN), a framework that explicitly leverages the structured priors imposed by the conjugate relationships between states and actions in a learned plannable latent space. We evaluate our method on real-world instructional videos. Our experiments show that DDN learns plannable representations that lead to better planning performance compared to existing planning approaches and neural network policies",

    "abstract": "Real-world object detectors are often challenged by the domain gaps between different datasets. In this work, we present the Conditional Domain Normalization (CDN) to bridge the domain distribution gap. CDN is designed to encode different domain inputs into a shared latent space, where the features from different domains carry the same domain attribute. To achieve this, we first disentangle the domain-specific attribute out of the semantic features from source domain via a domain embedding module, which learns a domain-vector to characterize the domain attribute information. Then this domain-vector is used to encode the features from target domain through a conditional normalization, resulting in different domains' features carrying the same domain attribute. We incorporate CDN into various convolution stages of an object detector to adaptively address the domain shifts of different level's representation. In contrast to existing adaptation works that conduct domain confusion learning on semantic features to remove domain-specific factors, CDN aligns different domain distributions by modulating the semantic features of target domains conditioned on the learned domain-vector of the source domain. Extensive experiments show that CDN outperforms existing methods remarkably on both real-to-real and synthetic-to-real adaptation benchmarks, including 2D image detection and 3D point cloud detection",

In this paper, we demonstrate that the coupling of these two by leveraging the strengths of each mitigates the other’s shortcomings. Specifically, we propose a joint narrow and wide baseline based self-improving framework, where on the one hand the CNN-predicted depth is leveraged to perform $ extit{pseudo}$ RGB-D feature-based SLAM, leading to better accuracy and robustness than the monocular RGB SLAM baseline. On the other hand, the bundle-adjusted 3D scene structures and camera poses from the more principled geometric SLAM are injected back into the depth network through novel wide baseline losses proposed for improving the depth prediction network, which then continues to contribute towards better pose and 3D structure estimation in the next iteration. We emphasize that our framework only requires $ extit{ unlabeled monocular}$ videos in both training and inference stages, and yet is able to outperform state-of-the-art self-supervised $ extit{monocular}$ and $ extit{stereo}$ depth prediction networks (e.g, Monodepth2) and feature based monocular SLAM system (i.e, ORB-SLAM).

    "abstract": "For person re-identification, existing deep networks often focus on representation learning. However, without transfer learning, the learned model is fixed as is, which is not adaptable for handling various unseen scenarios. In this paper, beyond representation learning, we consider how to formulate person image matching directly in deep feature maps. We treat image matching as finding local correspondences in feature maps, and construct query-adaptive convolution kernels on the fly to achieve local matching. In this way, the matching process and results are interpretable, and this explicit matching is more generalizable than representation features to unseen scenarios, such as unknown misalignments, pose or viewpoint changes. To facilitate end-to-end training of this architecture, we further build a class memory module to cache feature maps of the most recent samples of each class, so as to compute image matching losses for metric learning. Through direct cross-dataset evaluation, the proposed Query-Adaptive Convolution (QAConv) method gains large improvements over popular learning methods (about 10%+ mAP), and achieves comparable results to many transfer learning methods. Besides, a model-free temporal cooccurrence based score weighting method called TLift is proposed, which improves the performance to a further extent, achieving state-of-the-art results in cross-dataset person re-identification.

Such uncertainty enables the prediction of the target image with small mean squared error by averaging multiple predictions.

Specifically, we propose a two-stage graph-based and model-agnostic framework, called Graph-PCNN, with a localization subnet and a graph pose refinement module added onto the original heatmap regression network. In the first stage, heatmap regression network is applied to obtain a rough localization result, and a set of proposal keypoints, called guided points, are sampled. In the second stage, for each guided point, different visual feature is extracted by the localization subnet. The relationship between guided points is explored by the graph pose refinement module to get more accurate localization results.

In many applications of vision algorithms, the precise recognition of visual attributes of objects is important but still challenging. This is because defining a class hierarchy of attributes is ambiguous, so training data inevitably suffer from class imbalance and label sparsity, leading to a lack of effective annotations. An intuitive solution is to find a method to effectively learn image representations by utilizing unlabeled images. With that in mind, we propose a multi-teacher-single-student (MTSS) approach inspired by the multi-task learning and the distillation of semi-supervised learning. Our MTSS learns task-specific domain experts called teacher networks using the label embedding technique and learns a unified model called a student network by forcing a model to mimic the distributions learned by domain experts.

To depress noises in pseudo-labels, this paper proposes a Noise Resistible Mutual-Training (NRMT) method, which maintains two networks during training to perform collaborative clustering and mutual instance selection. On one hand, collaborative clustering eases the fitting to noisy instances by allowing the two networks to use pseudo-labels provided by each other as an additional supervision. On the other hand, mutual instance selection further selects reliable and informative instances for training according to the peer-confidence and relationship disagreement of the networks.

    "abstract": "Depth information has proven to be a useful cue in the semantic segmentation of RGB-D images for providing a geometric counterpart to the RGB representation. Most existing works simply assume that depth measurements are accurate and well-aligned with the RGB pixels and models the problem as a cross-modal feature fusion to obtain better feature representations to achieve more accurate segmentation. This, however, may not lead to satisfactory results as actual depth data are generally noisy, which might worsen the accuracy as the networks go deeper.  In this paper, we propose a unified and efficient Cross-modality Guided Encoder to not only effectively recalibrate RGB feature responses, but also to distill accurate depth information via multiple stages and aggregate the two recalibrated representations alternatively. The key of the proposed architecture is a novel Separation-and-Aggregation Gating operation that jointly filters and recalibrates both representations before cross-modality aggregation. Meanwhile, a Bi-direction Multi-step Propagation strategy is introduced, on the one hand, to help to propagate and fuse information between the two modalities, and on the other hand, to preserve their specificity along the long-term propagation process. Besides, our proposed encoder can be easily injected into the previous encoder-decoder structures to boost their performance on RGB-D semantic segmentation.

    "abstract": "Deep neural networks are widely deployed on edge devices (g, for computer vision and speech recognition).

However, both solutions have their limitations: edge devices are heavily constrained by insufficient hardware resources and cannot afford to run large models; cloud servers, if not trustworthy, will raise serious privacy issues. In this paper, we mediate between the resource-constrained edge devices and the privacy-invasive cloud servers by introducing a novel extit{privacy-preserving edge-cloud inference} framework, \\method. We off-load the majority of the computations to the cloud and leverage a pair of mixing and de-mixing operation, inspired by mixup, to protect the privacy of the data transmitted to the cloud. Our framework has three advantages. First, it is extit{privacy-preserving} as the mixing cannot be inverted without the user's private mixing coefficients. Second, our framework is extit{accuracy-preserving} because our framework takes advantage of the space spanned by images, and we train the model in a mixing-aware manner to maintain accuracy. Third, our solution is extit{efficient} on the edge since the majority of the workload is delegated to the cloud, and our mixing and de-mixing processes introduce very few extra computations. Also, our framework introduces small communication overhead and maintains high hardware utilization on the cloud. Extensive experiments on multiple computer vision and speech recognition datasets demonstrate that our framework can greatly reduce the local computations on the edge (to fewer than 20% of FLOPs) with negligible loss of accuracy and no leakages of private information",

To ad-dress these challenges, we propose a new method for neural re-renderingof a human under a novel user-defined pose and viewpoint given oneinput image. Our algorithm represents body pose and shape as a para-metric mesh which can be reconstructed from a single image and easilyreposed. Instead of a color-based UV texture-map, our approach furtheremploys a learned high-dimensional UV feature-map to encode appear-ance.

    "title": "Reversing the cycle: self-supervised deep stereo through enhanced monocular distillation",
    "abstract": "In many fields, self-supervised learning solutions are rapidly evolving and filling the gap with supervised approaches. This fact occurs for depth estimation based on either monocular or stereo, with the latter often providing a valid source of self-supervision for the former. In contrast, to soften typical stereo artefacts, we propose a novel self-supervised paradigm reversing the link between the two. Purposely, in order to train deep stereo networks, we distill knowledge through a monocular completion network. This architecture exploits single-image clues and few sparse points, sourced by traditional stereo algorithms, to estimate dense yet accurate disparity maps by means of a consensus mechanism over multiple estimations. We thoroughly evaluate with popular stereo datasets the impact of different supervisory signals showing how stereo networks trained with our paradigm outperform existing self-supervised frameworks. Finally, our proposal achieves notable generalization capabilities dealing with domain shift issues. Code available at https://github.com/FilippoAleotti/Reversing",

    "abstract": "Image quality assessment (IQA) is the key factor for the fast development of image restoration (IR) algorithms. The most recent IR methods based on Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have achieved significant improvement in visual performance, but also presented great challenges for quantitative evaluation. Notably, we observe an increasing inconsistency between perceptual quality and the evaluation results. Then we raise two questions: (1) Can existing IQA methods objectively evaluate recent IR algorithms? (2) When focus on beating current benchmarks, are we getting better IR algorithms? To answer these questions and promote the development of IQA methods, we contribute a large-scale IQA dataset, called Perceptual Image Processing Algorithms (PIPAL) dataset. Especially, this dataset includes the results of GAN-based methods, which are missing in previous datasets. We collect more than 1.13 million human judgments to assign subjective scores for PIPAL images using the more reliable ``Elo system''. Based on PIPAL, we present new benchmarks for both IQA and super-resolution methods. Our results indicate that existing IQA methods cannot fairly evaluate GAN-based IR algorithms. While using appropriate evaluation methods is important, IQA methods should also be updated along with the development of IR algorithms. At last, we improve the performance of IQA networks on GAN-based distortions by introducing anti-aliasing pooling. Experiments show the effectiveness of the proposed method",

Recent work has primarily focused on explaining models for tasks like image classification or visual question answering. In this paper, we introduce Salient Attributes for Network Explanation (SANE) to explain image similarity models, where a model's output is a score measuring the similarity of two inputs rather than a classification score. In this task, an explanation depends on both of the input images, so standard methods do not apply. Our SANE explanations pairs a saliency map identifying important image regions with an attribute that best explains the match. We find that our explanations provide additional information not typically captured by saliency maps alone, and can also improve performance on the classic task of attribute recognition.

    "abstract": "In contrast to great success of memory-consuming face editing methods at a low resolution, to manipulate high-resolution (HR) facial images, \\ie, typically larger than $768^2$ pixels, with very limited memory is still challenging. This is due to the reasons of 1) intractable huge demand of memory; 2) inefficient multi-scale features fusion. To address these issues, we propose a NOVEL pixel translation framework called mph{Cooperative GAN (CooGAN)} for HR facial image editing. This framework features a local path for fine-grained local facial patch generation (\\ie, patch-level HR, LOW memory) and a global path for global low-resolution (LR) facial structure monitoring (\\ie, image-level LR, LOW memory), which largely reduce memory requirements. Both paths work in a cooperative manner under a local-to-global consistency objective (\\ie, for smooth stitching). In addition, we propose a lighter selective transfer unit for more efficient multi-scale features fusion, yielding higher fidelity facial attributes manipulation. Extensive experiments on CelebA-HQ well demonstrate the memory efficiency as well as the high image generation quality of the proposed framework. \\keywords{Generative Adversarial Networks, Conditional GANs, Face Attributes Editing",

    "abstract": "The goal of automatic Sign Language Production (SLP) is to translate spoken language to a continuous stream of sign language video at a level comparable to a human translator. If this was achievable, then it would revolutionise Deaf hearing communications. Previous work on predominantly isolated SLP has shown the need for architectures that are better suited to the continuous domain of full sign sequences.  In this paper, we propose Progressive Transformers, the first SLP model to translate from discrete spoken language sentences to continuous 3D sign pose sequences in an end-to-end manner. A novel counter decoding technique is introduced, that enables continuous sequence generation at training and inference. We present two model configurations, an end-to-end network that produces sign direct from text and a stacked network that utilises a gloss intermediary. We also provide several data augmentation processes to overcome the problem of drift and drastically improve the performance of SLP models. We propose a back translation evaluation mechanism for SLP, presenting benchmark quantitative results on the challenging RWTH-PHOENIX-Weather-2014T (PHOENIX14T) dataset and setting baselines for future research.

    "title": "Mask TextSpotter v3: Segmentation Proposal Network for Robust Scene Text Spotting",
    "abstract": "Recent end-to-end trainable methods for scene text spotting, integrating detection and recognition, showed much progress. However, most of the current arbitrary-shape scene text spotters use region proposal networks (RPN) to produce proposals. RPN relies heavily on manually designed anchors and its proposals are represented with axis-aligned rectangles. The former presents difficulties in handling text instances of extreme aspect ratios or irregular shapes, and the latter often includes multiple neighboring instances into a single proposal, in cases of densely oriented text. To tackle these problems, we propose Mask TextSpotter v3, an end-to-end trainable scene text spotter that adopts a Segmentation Proposal Network (SPN) instead of an RPN. Our SPN is anchor-free and gives accurate representations of arbitrary-shape proposals. It is therefore superior to RPN in detecting text instances of extreme aspect ratios or irregular shapes. Furthermore, the accurate proposals produced by SPN allow masked RoI features to be used for decoupling neighboring text instances. As a result, our Mask TextSpotter v3 can handle text instances of extreme aspect ratios or irregular shapes, and its recognition accuracy won't be affected by nearby text or background noise. Specifically, we outperform state-of-the-art methods by 21.9 percent on the Rotated ICDAR 2013 dataset (rotation robustness), 5.9 percent on the Total-Text dataset (shape robustness), and achieve state-of-the-art performance on the MSRA-TD500 dataset (aspect ratio robustness).

    "abstract": "Local features such as SIFT and its affine and learned variants provide region-to-region rather than point-to-point correspondences. It has recently been exploited to create new minimal solvers for classical problems such as homography, essential and fundamental matrix estimation. The main argument in favor of such solvers is that their minimal sample size is smaller, e.g., only two instead of four matches are required to estimate a homography. Works proposing such solvers often claim a significant improvement in run-time thanks to fewer RANSAC iterations. We show that this argument is not valid in practice if the solvers are used naively as noise in the local feature geometries often causes RANSAC to fail to find an accurate solution. To overcome this, we propose guidelines for effective use of region-to-region matches in the course of a full model estimation pipeline. We propose a method for refining the local feature geometries by symmetric intensity-based matching, combine uncertainty propagation inside RANSAC with preemptive model verification, show a general scheme for computing uncertainty of minimal solvers results, and adapt the sample cheirality check for homography estimation to region-to-region correspondences. Our experiments show that affine solvers can achieve accuracy comparable to point-based solvers at faster run-times when following our guidelines",

    "abstract": "Margin-based deep face recognition methods (e.g. SphereFace, CosFace, and ArcFace) have achieved remarkable success in unconstrained face recognition. However, these methods are susceptible to the massive label noise in the training data and thus require laborious human effort to clean the datasets. In this paper, we relax the intra-class constraint of ArcFace to improve the robustness to label noise. More specifically, we design $K$ sub-centers for each class and the training sample only needs to be close to any of the $K$ positive sub-centers instead of the only one positive center. The proposed sub-center ArcFace encourages one dominant sub-class that contains the majority of clean faces and non-dominant sub-classes that include hard or noisy faces. Extensive experiments confirm the robustness of sub-center ArcFace under massive real-world noise. After the model achieves enough discriminative power, we directly drop non-dominant sub-centers and high-confident noisy samples, which helps recapture intra-compactness, decrease the influence from noise, and achieve comparable performance compared to ArcFace trained on the manually cleaned dataset. By taking advantage of the large-scale raw web faces (Celeb500K), sub-center Arcface achieves state-of-the-art performance on IJB-B, IJB-C, MegaFace, and FRVT",

Experimental results show that our model outperforms several existing systems in generating music that is pleasant to listen to.

Each view is noisy and incomplete, but important factors, such as physics, geometry, and semantics, tend to be shared between all views (e.g., a ``dog\"\" can be seen, heard, and felt). We investigate the classic hypothesis that a powerful representation is one that models view-invariant factors. We study this hypothesis under the framework of multiview contrastive learning, where we learn a representation that aims to maximize mutual information between different views of the same scene but is otherwise compact. Our approach scales to any number of views, and is view-agnostic. We analyze key properties of the approach that make it work, finding that the contrastive loss outperforms a popular alternative based on cross-view prediction, and that the more views we learn from, the better the resulting representation captures underlying scene semantics",

    "abstract": "This paper focuses on learning transferable adversarial examples specifically against defense models (models to defense adversarial attacks). In particular, we show that a simple universal perturbation can fool a series of state-of-the-art defenses.Adversarial examples generated by existing attacks are generally hard to transfer to defense models. We observe the property of regional homogeneity in adversarial perturbations and suggest that the defenses are less robust to regionally homogeneous perturbations. Therefore, we propose an effective transforming paradigm and a customized gradient transformer module to transform existing perturbations into regionally homogeneous ones. Without explicitly forcing the perturbations to be universal, we observe that a well-trained gradient transformer module tends to output input-independent gradients (hence universal) benefiting from the under-fitting phenomenon. Thorough experiments demonstrate that our work significantly outperforms the prior art attacking algorithms (either image-dependent or universal ones) by an average improvement of 14.0% when attacking 9 defenses in the transfer-based attack setting. In addition to the cross-model transferability, we also verify that regionally homogeneous perturbations can well transfer across different vision tasks (attacking with the semantic segmentation task and testing on the object detection task).

    "abstract": "Neural network quantization is an effective way to compress deep models and improve their execution latency and energy efficiency, so that they can be deployed on mobile or embedded devices. Existingquantization methods require original data for calibration or fine-tuning to get better performance. However, in many real-world scenarios, the data may not be available due to confidential or private issues, thereby making existing quantization methods not applicable. Moreover, due to the absence of original data, the recently developed generative adversarial networks (GANs) cannot be applied to generate data. Although the full-precision model may contain rich data information, such information alone is hard to exploit for recovering the original data or generating new meaningful data. In this paper, we investigate a simple-yet-effective method called Generative Low-bitwidth Data Free Quantization(GDFQ) to remove the data dependence burden. Specifically, we propose a knowledge matching generator to produce meaningful fake data by exploiting classification boundary knowledge and distribution information in the pre-trained model. With the help of generated data, we can quantize a model by learning knowledge from the pre-trained model. Extensive experiments on three data sets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. More critically, our method achieves much higher accuracy on4-bit quantization than the existing data free quantization method. Code is available at https://github.com/xushoukai/GDFQ",

Moreover, to make the student focus on those informative local regions of the teacher's feature maps, we propose a novel class-aware attention module to highlight the class-relevant regions and remove the confusing class-irrelevant regions, which makes the local correlation knowledge more accurate and valuable.

Notably, our method runs on datasets without any scene- or object-level 3D supervision. Our key insight is that considering humans and objects jointly gives rise to ``3D common sense\"\" constraints that can be used to resolve ambiguity. In particular, we introduce a scale loss that learns the distribution of object size from data; an occlusion-aware silhouette re-projection loss to optimize object pose; and a human-object interaction loss to capture the spatial layout of objects with which humans interact. We empirically validate that our constraints dramatically reduce the space of likely 3D spatial configurations. We demonstrate our approach on challenging, in-the-wild images of humans interacting with large objects (such as bicycles, motorcycles, and surfboards) and handheld objects (such as laptops, tennis rackets, and skateboards).

However, this fully supervised paradigm suffers from an inherent drawback: the recording of stereophonic audio usually requires delicate devices that are expensive for wide accessibility. To overcome this challenge, we propose to leverage the vastly available mono data to facilitate the generation of stereophonic audio. Our key observation is that the task of visually indicated audio separation also maps independent audios to their corresponding visual positions, which shares a similar objective with stereophonic audio generation. We integrate both stereo generation and source separation into a unified framework, Sep-Stereo, by considering source separation as a particular type of audio spatialization. Specifically, a novel associative pyramid network architecture is carefully designed for audio-visual feature fusion. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework can improve the stereophonic audio generation results while performing accurate sound separation with a shared backbone",

However, it is extremely challenging since recent advances are able to forge faces beyond the perception ability of human eyes, especially in compressed images and videos. We find that mining forgery patterns with the awareness of frequency could be a cure, as frequency provides a complementary viewpoint where either subtle forgery artifacts or compression errors could be well described. To introduce frequency into the face forgery detection, we propose a novel Frequency in Face Forgery Network (F$^3$-Net), taking advantages of two different but complementary frequency-aware clues, 1) frequency-aware decomposed image components, and 2) local frequency statistics, to deeply mine the forgery patterns via our two-stream collaborative learning framework. We apply DCT as the applied frequency-domain transformation.

We propose a novel method that generates a synthetic dataset that mimics natural human hand movements by re-engineering annotations of an extant static hand pose dataset into pose-flows. With the generated dataset, we train a newly proposed recurrent framework, exploiting visuo-temporal features from sequential images of synthetic hands in motion and emphasizing temporal smoothness of estimations with a temporal consistency constraint. Our novel training strategy of detaching the recurrent layer of the framework during domain finetuning from synthetic to real allows preservation of the visuo-temporal features learned from sequential synthetic hand images. Hand poses that are sequentially estimated consequently produce natural and smooth hand movements which lead to more robust estimations. We show that utilizing temporal information for 3D hand pose estimation significantly enhances general pose estimations by outperforming state-of-the-art methods in experiments on hand pose estimation benchmarks",

    "title": "Rethinking the Distribution Gap of Person Re-identification with Camera-based Batch Normalization",
    "abstract": "The fundamental difficulty in person re-identification (ReID) lies in learning the correspondence among individual cameras. It strongly demands costly inter-camera annotations, yet the trained models are not guaranteed to transfer well to previously unseen cameras. These problems significantly limit the application of ReID. This paper rethinks the working mechanism of conventional ReID approaches and puts forward a new solution. With an effective operator named Camera-based Batch Normalization (CBN), we force the image data of all cameras to fall onto the same subspace, so that the distribution gap between any camera pair is largely shrunk. This alignment brings two benefits. First, the trained model enjoys better abilities to generalize across scenarios with unseen cameras as well as transfer across multiple training sets. Second, we can rely on intra-camera annotations, which have been undervalued before due to the lack of cross-camera information, to achieve competitive ReID performance. Experiments on a wide range of ReID tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. The code is available at https://github.com/automan000/Camera-based-Person-ReID",

    "abstract": "Online knowledge distillation has attracted increasing interest recently, which jointly learns teacher and student models or an ensemble of student models simultaneously and collaboratively. On the other hand, existing works focus more on outcome-driven learning according to knowledge like classification probabilities whereas the distilling processes which capture rich and useful intermediate features and information are largely neglected. In this work, we propose an innovative adversarial-based mutual learning network (AMLN) that introduces process-driven learning beyond outcome-driven learning for augmented online knowledge distillation. A block-wise training module is designed which guides the information flow and mutual learning among peer networks adversarially throughout different learning stages, and this spreads until the final network layer which captures more high-level information. AMLN has been evaluated under a variety of network architectures over three widely used benchmark datasets. Extensive experiments show that AMLN achieves superior performance consistently against state-of-the-art knowledge transfer methods",

Most existing approaches are devised to work in an offline manner, where identifies can only be inferred after an entire video is examined. This working manner precludes such methods from being applied to online services or those applications that require real-time responses. In this paper, we propose an online person search framework, which can recognize people in a video on the fly. This framework maintains a multi-modal memory bank at its heart as the basis for person recognition, and updates it dynamically with a policy obtained by reinforcement learning.

Channel attention has been demonstrated to be effective for preserving information-rich features in each layer. However, channel attention treats each convolution layer as a separate process, which is kind of missing the correlation among different layers. To address this problem, we propose a new holistic attention network (HAN), which consists of a layer attention module (LAM) and a channel-spatial attention module (CSAM), to model the holistic interdependencies among layers, channels, and positions. Specifically, the proposed LAM adaptively emphasizes hierarchical features by considering correlations among layers. Meanwhile, CSAM learns the confidence at all the positions of each channel to selectively capture more informative features.

    "abstract": "The ubiquity of smartphone cameras has led to more and more documents being captured by cameras rather than scanned. Unlike flatbed scanners, photographed documents are often folded and crumpled, resulting in large local variance in text structure. The problem of document rectification is fundamental to the Optical Character Recognition (OCR) process on documents, and its ability to overcome geometric distortions significantly affects recognition accuracy. Despite the great progress in recent OCR systems, most still rely on a pre-process that ensures the text lines are straight and axis aligned. Recent works have tackled the problem of rectifying document images taken in-the-wild using various supervision signals and alignment means. However, they focused on global features that can be extracted from the document's boundaries, ignoring various signals that could be obtained from the document's content. We present CREASE: Content Aware Rectification using Angle Supervision, the first learned method for document rectification that relies on the document's content, the location of the words and specifically their orientation, as hints to assist in the rectification process. We utilize a novel pixel-wise angle regression approach and a curvature estimation side-task for optimizing our rectification model.

    "abstract": "Normalization layers play an important role in deep network training. As one of the most popular normalization techniques, batch normalization (BN) has shown its eﬀectiveness in accelerating the model training speed and improving model generalization capability. The success of BN has been explained from diﬀerent views, such as reducing internal covariate shift, allowing the use of large learning rate, smoothing optimization landscape, etc. To make a deeper understanding of BN, in this work we prove that BN actually introduces a certain level of noise into the sample mean and variance during the training process, while the noise level depends only on the batch size. Such a noise generation mechanism of BN regularizes the training process, and we present an explicit regularizer formulation of BN. Since the regularization strength of BN is determined by the batch size, a small batch size may cause the under-ﬁtting problem, resulting in a less eﬀective model. To reduce the dependency of BN on batch size, we propose a momentum BN (MBN) scheme by averaging the mean and variance of current mini-batch with the historical means and variances. With a dynamic momentum parameter, we can automatically control the noise level in the training process. As a result, MBN works very well even when the batch size is very small (e.g., 2), which is hard to achieve by traditional BN",

    "abstract": "Deep neural networks are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, in which imperceptible perturbations to their input lead to erroneous network predictions. This phenomenon has been extensively studied in the image domain, and has only recently been extended to 3D point clouds. In this work, we present novel data-driven adversarial attacks against 3D point cloud networks. We aim to address the following problems in current 3D point cloud adversarial attacks: they do not transfer well between different networks, and they are easy to defend against via simple statistical methods. To this extent, we develop a new point cloud attack (dubbed AdvPC) that exploits the input data distribution by adding an adversarial loss, after Auto-Encoder reconstruction, to the objective it optimizes. AdvPC leads to perturbations that are resilient against current defenses, while remaining highly transferable compared to state-of-the-art attacks. We test AdvPC using four popular point cloud networks: PointNet, PointNet++ (MSG and SSG), and DGCNN. Our proposed attack increases the attack success rate by up to 40% for those transferred to unseen networks (transferability), while maintaining a high success rate on the attacked network. AdvPC also increases the ability to break defenses by up to 38% as compared to other baselines on the ModelNet40 dataset. The code is available at https://github.com/ajhamdi/AdvPC",

    "abstract": "Face parsing infers a pixel-wise label to each facial component, which has drawn much attention recently. Previous methods have shown their efficiency in face parsing, which however overlook the correlation among different face regions. The correlation is a critical clue about the facial appearance, pose, expression etc., and should be taken into account for face parsing. To this end, we propose to model and reason the region-wise relations by learning graph representations, and leverage the edge information between regions for optimized abstraction. Specifically, we encode a facial image onto a global graph representation where a collection of pixels (\"\"regions\"\") with similar features are projected to each vertex. Our model learns and reasons over relations between the regions by propagating information across vertices on the graph. Furthermore, we incorporate the edge information to aggregate the pixel-wise features onto vertices, which emphasizes on the features around edges for fine segmentation along edges. The finally learned graph representation is projected back to pixel grids for parsing. Experiments demonstrate that our model outperforms state-of-the-art methods on the widely used Helen dataset, and also exhibits the superior performance on the large-scale CelebAMask-HQ dataset",

In particular, we 1) propose a bifurcated backbone strategy (BBS) to split the multi-level features into teacher and student features, and 2) utilize a depth-enhanced module (DEM) to excavate informative parts of depth cues from the channel and spatial views. This fuses RGB and depth modalities in a complementary way.

The non-linear low-dimensional manifold discovery of data is done through describing a joint distribution over observations, and their low-dimensional representations (i.e. manifold coordinates). Our model, called generative low-dimensional background model (G-LBM) admits variational operations on the distribution of the manifold coordinates and simultaneously generates a low-rank structure of the latent manifold given the data. Therefore, our probabilistic model contains the intuition of the non-probabilistic low-dimensional manifold learning. G-LBM selects the intrinsic dimensionality of the underling manifold of the observations, and its probabilistic nature models the noise in the observation data. G-LBM has direct application in the background scenes model estimation from video sequences and we have evaluated its performance on SBMnet-2016 and BMC2012 datasets, where it achieved a performance higher or comparable to other state-of-the-art methods while being agnostic to the background scenes in videos. Besides, in challenges such as camera jitter and background motion, G-LBM is able to robustly estimate the background by effectively modeling the uncertainties in video observations in these scenarios",

The critical idea of H3DNet is to predict a hybrid set of geometric primitives, i.e., BB centers, BB face centers, and BB edge centers. We show how to convert the predicted geometric primitives into object proposals by defining a distance function between an object and the geometric primitives. This distance function enables continuous optimization of object proposals, and its local minimums provide high-fidelity object proposals. H3DNet then utilizes a matching and refinement module to classify object proposals into detected objects and fine-tune the geometric parameters of the detected objects. The hybrid set of geometric primitives not only provides more accurate signals for object detection than using a single type of geometric primitives, but it also provides an overcomplete set of constraints on the resulting 3D layout. Therefore, H3DNet can tolerate outliers in predicted geometric primitives. Our model achieves state-of-the-art 3D detection results on two large datasets with real 3D scans, ScanNet and SUN RGB-D",

It is important to note that traditional person-specific CAs are learned from few training samples, and typically lack robustness as well as limited expressiveness when transferring facial expressions. MCAs solve these issues by learning a modulated adaptive blending of different facial components as well as an exemplar-based latent alignment.

The existing works either simply distill prior knowledge from the corresponding depth map to handle the RGB-image or blindly fuse color and geometric information to generate the depth-aware representations, hindering the performance of RGB-D saliency detectors. In this work, we introduce Cascade Graph Neural Networks (Cas-Gnn), a unified framework which is capable of comprehensively distilling and reasoning the mutual benefit between these two data sources through a set of cascade graphs, to learn powerful representations for RGB-D salient object detection. Cas-Gnn processes the two data sources separately and employs a novel Cascade Graph Reasoning (CGR) module to learn the powerful dense feature embeddings so that the saliency map can be easily inferred. Different from previous approaches, Cas-Gnn, by explicitly modeling and reasoning high-level relations between complementary data sources, can overcome many challenges like occlusions and ambiguities. Extensive experiments on several widely-used benchmarks demonstrate that CasGnn achieves significantly better performance than all existing RGB-D SOD approaches",

An interesting topic is the study of mechanisms via which the de novo design or training of the model can be informed by fairness measures. Here, we study mechanisms that impose fairness concurrently while training the model. While existing fairness based approaches in vision have largely relied on training adversarial modules together with the primary classification/regression task, in an effort to remove the influence of the protected attribute or variable, we show how ideas based on well-known optimization concepts can provide a simpler alternative. In our proposed scheme, imposing fairness just requires specifying the protected attribute and utilizing our optimization routine.

    "abstract": "In this paper, we address the problem of nighttime defogging from a single image. We propose a framework consisting of two main modules: grayscale and color modules. Given an RGB foggy nighttime image, our grayscale module takes the grayscale version of the image as input, and decomposes it into high and low frequency layers. The high frequency layer contains the scene texture information, which is less affected by fog; and, the low frequency layer contains the scene layout/structure information including fog and glow. Our grayscale module then enhances the visibility of the textures in the high frequency layers, and removes the presence of glow and fog in the low frequency layers. Having processed the high/low frequency information, it fuses the layers to obtain a grayscale defogged image. Our second module, the color module, takes the original RGB image as input. The module has similar operations to those of the grayscale module. However, to obtain fog-free high and low frequency information, the module is guided by the grayscale module. The reason of doing this is because grayscale images are less affected by multiple colors of atmospheric light, which are commonly present in nighttime scenes. Moreover, having the grayscale module allows us to have consistency losses between the outputs of the two modules, which is critical to our framework, since we do not have paired ground-truths for our real data. Our extensive experiments on real foggy nighttime images show the effectiveness of our method",

    "title": "SegFix: Model-Agnostic Boundary Refinement for Segmentation",
    "abstract": "We present a model-agnostic post-processing scheme to improve the boundary quality for the segmentation result that is generated by any existing segmentation model. Motivated by the empirical observation that the label predictions of interior pixels are more reliable, we propose to replace the originally unreliable predictions of boundary pixels by the predictions of interior pixels. Our approach processes only the input image through two steps: (i) localize the boundary pixels and (ii) identify the corresponding interior pixel for each boundary pixel. We build the correspondence by learning a direction away from the boundary pixel to an interior pixel. Our method requires no prior information of the segmentation models and achieves nearly real-time speed. We empirically verify that our SegFix consistently reduces the boundary errors for segmentation results generated from various state-of-the-art models on Cityscapes, ADE20K and GTA5",

    "title": "Spatio-Temporal Graph Transformer Networks for Pedestrian Trajectory Prediction",
    "abstract": "Understanding crowd motion dynamics is critical to real-world applications, e.g., surveillance systems and autonomous driving. This is challenging because it requires effectively modeling the socially aware crowd spatial interaction and complex temporal dependencies. We believe attention is the most important factor for trajectory prediction. In this paper, we present STAR, a Spatio-Temporal grAph tRansformer framework, which tackles trajectory prediction by only attention mechanisms. STAR models intra-graph crowd interaction by TGConv, a novel Transformer-based graph convolution mechanism. The inter-graph temporal dependencies are modeled by separate temporal Transformers. STAR captures complex spatio-temporal interactions by interleaving between spatial and temporal Transformers. To calibrate the temporal prediction for the long-lasting effect of disappeared pedestrians, we introduce a read-writable external memory module, consistently being updated by the temporal Transformer. We show STAR outperforms the state-of-the-art models on 4 out of 5 real-world pedestrian trajectory prediction datasets and achieves comparable performance on the rest",

    "title": "Fast Bi-layer Neural Synthesis of One-Shot Realistic Head Avatars",
    "abstract": "We propose a neural rendering-based system that creates head avatars from a single photograph. Our approach models a person's appearance by decomposing it into two layers. The first layer is a pose-dependent coarse image that is synthesized by a small neural network. The second layer is defined by a pose-independent texture image that contains high-frequency details. The texture image is generated offline, warped and added to the coarse image to ensure a high effective resolution of synthesized head views. We compare our system to analogous state-of-the-art systems in terms of visual quality and speed. The experiments show significant inference speedup over previous neural head avatar models for a given visual quality. We also report on a real-time smartphone-based implementation of our system",

    "title": "Neural Geometric Parser for Single Image Camera Calibration",
    "abstract": "We propose a neural geometric parser learning single image camera calibration for man-made scenes. Unlike previous neural approaches that rely only on semantic cues obtained from neural networks, our approach considers both semantic and geometric cues, resulting in significant accuracy improvement. The proposed framework consists of two networks. Using line segments of an image as geometric cues, the first network estimates the zenith vanishing point and generates several candidates consisting of the camera rotation and focal length. The second network evaluates each candidate based on the given image and the geometric cues, where prior knowledge of man-made scenes is used for the evaluation. With the supervision of datasets consisting of the horizontal line and focal length of the images, our networks can be trained to estimate the same camera parameters. Based on the Manhattan world assumption, we can further estimate the camera rotation and focal length in a weakly supervised manner. The experimental results reveal that the performance of our neural approach is significantly higher than that of existing state-of-the-art camera calibration techniques for single images of indoor and outdoor scenes",

    "title": "Learning Flow-based Feature Warping for Face Frontalization with Illumination Inconsistent Supervision",
    "abstract": "Despite recent advances in deep learning-based face frontalization methods, photo-realistic and illumination preserving frontal face synthesis is still challenging due to large pose and illumination discrepancy during training. We propose a novel Flow-based Feature Warping Model (FFWM) which can learn to synthesize photo-realistic and illumination preserving frontal images with illumination inconsistent supervision. Specifically, an Illumination Preserving Module (IPM) is proposed to learn illumination preserving image synthesis from illumination inconsistent image pairs. IPM includes two pathways which collaborate to ensure the synthesized frontal images are illumination preserving and with fine details. Moreover, a Warp Attention Module (WAM) is introduced to reduce the pose discrepancy in the feature level, and hence to synthesize frontal images more effectively and preserve more details of profile images. The attention mechanism in WAM helps reduce the artifacts caused by the displacements between the profile and the frontal images. Quantitative and qualitative experimental results show that our FFWM can synthesize photo-realistic and illumination preserving frontal images and performs favorably against state-of-the-art results",

    "title": "Learning Architectures for Binary Networks",
    "abstract": "Backbone architectures of most binary networks are well-known floating point architectures such as the ResNet family. Questioning that the architectures designed for floating point networks would not be the best for binary networks, we propose to search architectures for binary networks (BNAS) by defining a new search space for binary architectures and a novel search objective. Specifically, based on the cell based search method, we define the new search space of binary layer types, design a new cell template, and rediscover the utility of and propose to use the Zeroise layer instead of using it as a placeholder. The novel search objective diversifies early search to learn better performing binary architectures. We show that our proposed method searches architectures with stable training curves despite the quantization error inherent in binary networks. Quantitative analyses demonstrate that our searched architectures outperform the architectures used in state-of-the-art binary networks and outperform or perform on par with state-of-the-art binary networks that employ various techniques other than architectural changes",

    "title": "Semantic View Synthesis",
    "abstract": "We tackle a new problem of semantic view synthesis --- generating free-viewpoint rendering of a synthesized scene using a semantic label map as input. We build upon recent advances in semantic image synthesis and view synthesis for handling photographic image content generation and view extrapolation. Direct application of existing image/view synthesis methods, however, results in severe ghosting/blurry artifacts. To address the drawbacks, we propose a two-step approach. First, we focus on synthesizing the color and depth of the visible surface of the 3D scene. We then use the synthesized color and depth to impose explicit constraints on the multiple-plane image (MPI) representation prediction process. Our method produces sharp contents at the original view and geometrically consistent renderings across novel viewpoints. The experiments on numerous indoor and outdoor images show favorable results against several strong baselines and validate the effectiveness of our approach",

This is a common problem in a wide range of computer vision applications where a linear system has a lot more equations than unknowns and we wish to find the maximum feasible set of equations by discarding unreliable ones. We show that one of the most popular solution methods, iteratively reweighted least squares (IRLS), can be significantly accelerated by the use of matrix sketching.
