    "volume": "oral",
    "abstract": "To achieve the highest perceptual quality, state-of-the-art diffusion models are optimized with objectives that typically look very different from the maximum likelihood and the Evidence Lower Bound (ELBO) objectives. In this work, we reveal that diffusion model objectives are actually closely related to the ELBO. Specifically, we show that all commonly used diffusion model objectives equate to a weighted integral of ELBOs over different noise levels, where the weighting depends on the specific objective used. Under the condition of monotonic weighting, the connection is even closer: the diffusion objective then equals the ELBO, combined with simple data augmentation, namely Gaussian noise perturbation. We show that this condition holds for a number of state-of-the-art diffusion models. In experiments, we explore new monotonic weightings and demonstrate their effectiveness, achieving state-of-the-art FID scores on the high-resolution ImageNet benchmark",

    "title": "Improved Algorithms for Stochastic Linear Bandits Using Tail Bounds for Martingale Mixtures",
    "volume": "oral",
    "abstract": "We present improved algorithms with worst-case regret guarantees for the stochastic linear bandit problem. The widely used \"optimism in the face of uncertainty\" principle reduces a stochastic bandit problem to the construction of a confidence sequence for the unknown reward function. The performance of the resulting bandit algorithm depends on the size of the confidence sequence, with smaller confidence sets yielding better empirical performance and stronger regret guarantees. In this work, we use a novel tail bound for adaptive martingale mixtures to construct confidence sequences which are suitable for stochastic bandits. These confidence sequences allow for efficient action selection via convex programming. We prove that a linear bandit algorithm based on our confidence sequences is guaranteed to achieve competitive worst-case regret. We show that our confidence sequences are tighter than competitors, both empirically and theoretically. Finally, we demonstrate that our tighter confidence sequences give improved performance in several hyperparameter tuning tasks",

    "title": "Spatial-frequency channels, shape bias, and adversarial robustness",
    "volume": "oral",
    "abstract": "What spatial frequency information do humans and neural networks use to recognize objects? In neuroscience, critical band masking is an established tool that can reveal the frequency-selective filters used for object recognition. Critical band masking measures the sensitivity of recognition performance to noise added at each spatial frequency. Existing critical band masking studies show that humans recognize periodic patterns (gratings) and letters by means of a spatial-frequency filter (or \"channel\") that has a frequency bandwidth of one octave (doubling of frequency). Here, we introduce critical band masking as a task for network-human comparison and test 14 humans and 76 neural networks on 16-way ImageNet categorization in the presence of narrowband noise. We find that humans recognize objects in natural images using the same one-octave-wide channel that they use for letters and gratings, making it a canonical feature of human object recognition. Unlike humans, the neural network channel is very broad, 2-4 times wider than the human channel. This means that the network channel extends to frequencies higher and lower than those that humans are sensitive to. Thus, noise at those frequencies will impair network performance and spare human performance. Adversarial and augmented-image training are commonly used to increase network robustness and shape bias. Does this training align network and human object recognition channels? Three network channel properties (bandwidth, center frequency, peak noise sensitivity) correlate strongly with shape bias (51% variance explained) and robustness of adversarially-trained networks (66% variance explained). Adversarial training increases robustness but expands the channel bandwidth even further beyond the human bandwidth. Thus, critical band masking reveals that the network channel is more than twice as wide as the human channel, and that adversarial training only makes it worse. Networks with narrower channels might be more robust",

    "title": "Linguistic Binding in Diffusion Models: Enhancing Attribute Correspondence through Attention Map Alignment",
    "volume": "oral",
    "abstract": "Text-conditioned image generation models often generate incorrect associations between entities and their visual attributes. This reflects an impaired mapping between linguistic binding of entities and modifiers in the prompt and visual binding of the corresponding elements in the generated image. As one example, a query like ``a pink sunflower and a yellow flamingo'' may incorrectly produce an image of a yellow sunflower and a pink flamingo. To remedy this issue, we propose SynGen, an approach which first syntactically analyses the prompt to identify entities and their modifiers, and then uses a novel loss function that encourages the cross-attention maps to agree with the linguistic binding reflected by the syntax. Specifically, we encourage large overlap between attention maps of entities and their modifiers, and small overlap with other entities and modifier words. The loss is optimized during inference, without retraining or fine-tuning the model. Human evaluation on three datasets, including one new and challenging set, demonstrate significant improvements of SynGen compared with current state of the art methods. This work highlights how making use of sentence structure during inference can efficiently and substantially improve the faithfulness of text-to-image generation",

    "abstract": "Denoising diffusion probabilistic models have transformed image generation with their impressive fidelity and diversity. We show that they also excel in estimating optical flow and monocular depth, surprisingly without task-specific architectures and loss functions that are predominant for these tasks. Compared to the point estimates of conventional regression-based methods, diffusion models also enable Monte Carlo inference, e.g., capturing uncertainty and ambiguity in flow and depth. With self-supervised pre-training, the combined use of synthetic and real data for supervised training, and technical innovations (infilling and step-unrolled denoising diffusion training) to handle noisy-incomplete training data, one can train state-of-the-art diffusion models for depth and optical flow estimation, with additional zero-shot coarse-to-fine refinement for high resolution estimates. Extensive experiments focus on quantitative performance against benchmarks, ablations, and the model's ability to capture uncertainty and multimodality, and impute missing values.

    "volume": "oral",
    "abstract": "While large-scale unsupervised language models (LMs) learn broad world knowledge and some reasoning skills, achieving precise control of their behavior is difficult due to the completely unsupervised nature of their training. Existing methods for gaining such steerability collect human labels of the relative quality of model generations and fine-tune the unsupervised LM to align with these preferences, often with reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). However, RLHF is a complex and often unstable procedure, first fitting a reward model that reflects the human preferences, and then fine-tuning the large unsupervised LM using reinforcement learning to maximize this estimated reward without drifting too far from the original model. In this paper, we leverage a mapping between reward functions and optimal policies to show that this constrained reward maximization problem can be optimized exactly with a single stage of policy training, essentially solving a classification problem on the human preference data. The resulting algorithm, which we call Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), is stable, performant, and computationally lightweight, eliminating the need for fitting a reward model, sampling from the LM during fine-tuning, or performing significant hyperparameter tuning. Our experiments show that DPO can fine-tune LMs to align with human preferences as well as or better than existing methods. Notably, fine-tuning with DPO exceeds RLHF's ability to control sentiment of generations and improves response quality in summarization and single-turn dialogue while being substantially simpler to implement and train",

In contrast to prior work on testable learning, our tester is not tailored to any single target distribution but rather succeeds for an entire target class of distributions. The class of Poincare distributions includes all strongly log-concave distributions, and, assuming the Kannan--Lovasz--Simonovits (KLS) conjecture, includes all log-concave distributions. In the special case where the label noise is known to be Massart, our tester-learner achieves error $\\mathrm{opt} + \\epsilon$ while accepting all log-concave distributions unconditionally (without assuming KLS).

    "abstract": "We investigate the problem of machine learning-based (ML) predictive inference on individual treatment effects (ITEs). Previous work has focused primarily on developing ML-based \"meta-learners\" that can provide point estimates of the conditional average treatment effect (CATE)—these are model-agnostic approaches for combining intermediate nuisance estimates to produce estimates of CATE. In this paper, we develop conformal meta-learners, a general framework for issuing predictive intervals for ITEs by applying the standard conformal prediction (CP) procedure on top of CATE meta-learners. We focus on a broad class of meta-learners based on two-stage pseudo-outcome regression and develop a stochastic ordering framework to study their validity. We show that inference with conformal meta-learners is marginally valid if their (pseudo-outcome) conformity scores stochastically dominate \"oracle\" conformity scores evaluated on the unobserved ITEs. Additionally, we prove that commonly used CATE meta-learners, such as the doubly-robust learner, satisfy a model- and distribution-free stochastic (or convex) dominance condition, making their conformal inferences valid for practically-relevant levels of target coverage. Whereas existing procedures conduct inference on nuisance parameters (i.e., potential outcomes) via weighted CP, conformal meta-learners enable direct inference on the target parameter (ITE). Numerical experiments show that conformal meta-learners provide valid intervals with competitive efficiency while retaining the favorable point estimation properties of CATE meta-learners",

We ask whether there exist generative models that (i) are expressive enough to generate approximately optimal solutions; (ii) have a tractable, i.e, polynomial in the size of the input, number of parameters; (iii) their optimization landscape is benign in the sense that it does not contain sub-optimal stationary points. Our main contribution is a positive answer to this question. Our result holds for a broad class of combinatorial problems including Max- and Min-Cut, Max-$k$-CSP, Maximum-Weight-Bipartite-Matching, and the Traveling Salesman Problem.

    "abstract": "Recent research in mechanistic interpretability has attempted to reverse-engineer Transformer models by carefully inspecting network weights and activations. However, these approaches require considerable manual effort and still fall short of providing complete, faithful descriptions of the underlying algorithms. In this work, we introduce a procedure for training Transformers that are mechanistically interpretable by design. We build on RASP [Weiss et al., 2021], a programming language that can be compiled into Transformer weights. Instead of compiling human-written programs into Transformers, we design a modified Transformer that can be trained using gradient-based optimization and then automatically converted into a discrete, human-readable program. We refer to these models as Transformer Programs. To validate our approach, we learn Transformer Programs for a variety of problems, including an in-context learning task, a suite of algorithmic problems (e.g. sorting, recognizing Dyck languages), and NLP tasks including named entity recognition and text classification. The Transformer Programs can automatically find reasonable solutions, performing on par with standard Transformers of comparable size; and, more importantly, they are easy to interpret. To demonstrate these advantages, we convert Transformers into Python programs and use off-the-shelf code analysis tools to debug model errors and identify the \"circuits\" used to solve different sub-problems. We hope that Transformer Programs open a new path toward the goal of intrinsically interpretable machine learning",

We identify and study the *Clifford group*: a subgroup inside the Clifford algebra tailored to achieve several favorable properties. Primarily, the group's action forms an orthogonal automorphism that extends beyond the typical vector space to the entire Clifford algebra while respecting the multivector grading. This leads to several non-equivalent subrepresentations corresponding to the multivector decomposition. Furthermore, we prove that the action respects not just the vector space structure of the Clifford algebra but also its multiplicative structure, i.e., the geometric product. These findings imply that every polynomial in multivectors, including their grade projections, constitutes an equivariant map with respect to the Clifford group, allowing us to parameterize equivariant neural network layers. An advantage worth mentioning is that we obtain expressive layers that can elegantly generalize to inner-product spaces of any dimension.

    "abstract": "Current deep-learning models for object recognition are known to be heavily biased toward texture. In contrast, human visual systems are known to be biased toward shape and structure. What could be the design principles in human visual systems that led to this difference? How could we introduce more shape bias into the deep learning models? In this paper, we report that sparse coding, a ubiquitous principle in the brain, can in itself introduce shape bias into the network. We found that enforcing the sparse coding constraint using a non-differential Top-K operation can lead to the emergence of structural encoding in neurons in convolutional neural networks, resulting in a smooth decomposition of objects into parts and subparts and endowing the networks with shape bias. We demonstrated this emergence of shape bias and its functional benefits for different network structures with various datasets. For object recognition convolutional neural networks, the shape bias leads to greater robustness against style and pattern change distraction. For the image synthesis generative adversary networks, the emerged shape bias leads to more coherent and decomposable structures in the synthesized images. Ablation studies suggest that sparse codes tend to encode structures, whereas the more distributed codes tend to favor texture.

However, existing architectures such as Transformers scale quadratically along both these axes. We ask: are there performant architectures that can scale sub-quadratically along sequence length and model dimension? We introduce Monarch Mixer (M2), a new architecture that uses the same sub-quadratic primitive along both sequence length and model dimension: Monarch matrices, a simple class of expressive structured matrices that captures many linear transforms, achieves high hardware efficiency on GPUs, and scales sub-quadratically. As a proof of concept, we explore the performance of M2 in three domains: non-causal BERT-style language modeling, ViT-style image classification, and causal GPT-style language modeling. For non-causal BERT-style modeling, M2 matches BERT-base and BERT-large in downstream GLUE quality with up to 27% fewer parameters, and achieves up to 9.1$\\times$ higher throughput at sequence length 4K. On ImageNet, M2 outperforms ViT-b by 1% in accuracy, with only half the parameters. Causal GPT-style models introduce a technical challenge: enforcing causality via masking introduces a quadratic bottleneck. To alleviate this bottleneck, we develop a novel theoretical view of Monarch matrices based on multivariate polynomial evaluation and interpolation, which lets us parameterize M2 to be causal while remaining sub-quadratic. Using this parameterization, M2 matches GPT-style Transformers at 360M parameters in pretraining perplexity on The PILE—showing for the first time that it may be possible to match Transformer quality without attention or MLPs",

    "abstract": "Previous work on user-level differential privacy (DP) [Ghazi et al. NeurIPS 2021, Bun et al. STOC 2023] obtained generic algorithms that work for various learning tasks. However, their focus was on the *example-rich* regime, where the users have so many examples that each user could themselves solve the problem. In this work we consider the *example-scarce* regime, where each user has only a few examples, and obtain the following results: * For approximate-DP, we give a generic transformation of any item-level DP algorithm to a user-level DP algorithm. Roughly speaking, the latter gives a (multiplicative) savings of $O_{\\varepsilon,\\delta}(\\sqrt{m})$ in terms of the number of users required for achieving the same utility, where $m$ is the number of examples per user. This algorithm, while recovering most known bounds for specific problems, also gives new bounds, e.g., for PAC learning. * For pure-DP, we present a simple technique for adapting the exponential mechanism [McSherry & Talwar, FOCS 2007] to the user-level setting. This gives new bounds for a variety of tasks, such as private PAC learning, hypothesis selection, and distribution learning. For some of these problems, we show that our bounds are near-optimal",

    "title": "Why think step by step? Reasoning emerges from the locality of experience",
    "volume": "oral",
    "abstract": "Humans have a powerful and mysterious capacity to reason. Working through a set of mental steps enables us to make inferences we would not be capable of making directly even though we get no additional data from the world. Similarly, when large language models generate intermediate steps (a chain of thought) before answering a question, they often produce better answers than they would directly. We investigate why and how chain-of-thought reasoning is useful in language models, testing the hypothesis that reasoning is effective when training data consists of overlapping local clusters of variables that influence each other strongly. These training conditions enable the chaining of accurate local inferences to estimate relationships between variables that were not seen together in training. We prove that there will exist a \"reasoning gap\", where reasoning through intermediate variables reduces bias, for the simple case of an autoregressive density estimator trained on local samples from a chain-structured probabilistic model. We then test our hypothesis experimentally in more complex models, training an autoregressive language model on samples from Bayes nets but only including a subset of variables in each sample. We test language models' ability to match conditional probabilities with and without intermediate reasoning steps, finding that intermediate steps are only helpful when the training data is locally structured with respect to dependencies between variables. The combination of locally structured observations and reasoning is much more data-efficient than training on all variables. Our results illustrate how the effectiveness of reasoning step by step is rooted in the local statistical structure of the training data",

    "volume": "oral",
    "abstract": "A long standing goal in neuroscience has been to elucidate the functional organization of the brain. Within higher visual cortex, functional accounts have remained relatively coarse, focusing on regions of interest (ROIs) and taking the form of selectivity for broad categories such as faces, places, bodies, food, or words. Because the identification of such ROIs has typically relied on manually assembled stimulus sets consisting of isolated objects in non-ecological contexts, exploring functional organization without robust a priori hypotheses has been challenging. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a data-driven approach in which we synthesize images predicted to activate a given brain region using paired natural images and fMRI recordings, bypassing the need for category-specific stimuli. Our approach -- Brain Diffusion for Visual Exploration (\"BrainDiVE\") -- builds on recent generative methods by combining large-scale diffusion models with brain-guided image synthesis. Validating our method, we demonstrate the ability to synthesize preferred images with appropriate semantic specificity for well-characterized category-selective ROIs. We then show that BrainDiVE can characterize differences between ROIs selective for the same high-level category. Finally we identify novel functional subdivisions within these ROIs, validated with behavioral data. These results advance our understanding of the fine-grained functional organization of human visual cortex, and provide well-specified constraints for further examination of cortical organization using hypothesis-driven methods",

    "abstract": "Recent work claims that large language models display \\textit{emergent abilities}, abilities not present in smaller-scale models that are present in larger-scale models. What makes emergent abilities intriguing is two-fold: their \\textit{sharpness}, transitioning seemingly instantaneously from not present to present, and their \\textit{unpredictability}, appearing at seemingly unforeseeable model scales. Here, we present an alternative explanation for emergent abilities: that for a particular task and model family, when analyzing fixed model outputs, emergent abilities appear due the researcher's choice of metric rather than due to fundamental changes in model behavior with scale. Specifically, nonlinear or discontinuous metrics produce apparent emergent abilities, whereas linear or continuous metrics produce smooth, continuous, predictable changes in model performance. We present our alternative explanation in a simple mathematical model, then test it in three complementary ways: we (1) make, test and confirm three predictions on the effect of metric choice using the InstructGPT/GPT-3 family on tasks with claimed emergent abilities, (2) make, test and confirm two predictions about metric choices in a meta-analysis of emergent abilities on BIG-Bench; and (3) show how to choose metrics to produce never-before-seen seemingly emergent abilities in multiple vision tasks across diverse deep networks. Via all three analyses, we provide evidence that alleged emergent abilities evaporate with different metrics or with better statistics, and may not be a fundamental property of scaling AI models",

We show that both are possible for a class of decoders that we call additive, which are reminiscent of decoders used for object-centric representation learning (OCRL) and well suited for images that can be decomposed as a sum of object-specific images. We provide conditions under which exactly solving the reconstruction problem using an additive decoder is guaranteed to identify the blocks of latent variables up to permutation and block-wise invertible transformations. This guarantee relies only on very weak assumptions about the distribution of the latent factors, which might present statistical dependencies and have an almost arbitrarily shaped support. Our result provides a new setting where nonlinear independent component analysis (ICA) is possible and adds to our theoretical understanding of OCRL methods. We also show theoretically that additive decoders can generate novel images by recombining observed factors of variations in novel ways, an ability we refer to as Cartesian-product extrapolation.

    "abstract": "Fine-tuning language models (LMs) has yielded success on diverse downstream tasks, but as LMs grow in size, backpropagation requires a prohibitively large amount of memory. Zeroth-order (ZO) methods can in principle estimate gradients using only two forward passes but are theorized to be catastrophically slow for optimizing large models. In this work, we propose a memory-efficient zerothorder optimizer (MeZO), adapting the classical ZO-SGD method to operate in-place, thereby fine-tuning LMs with the same memory footprint as inference. For example, with a single A100 80GB GPU, MeZO can train a 30-billion parameter model, whereas fine-tuning with backpropagation can train only a 2.7B LM with the same budget. We conduct comprehensive experiments across model types (masked and autoregressive LMs), model scales (up to 66B), and downstream tasks (classification, multiple-choice, and generation). Our results demonstrate that (1) MeZO significantly outperforms in-context learning and linear probing; (2) MeZO achieves comparable performance to fine-tuning with backpropagation across multiple tasks, with up to 12× memory reduction and up to 2× GPU-hour reduction in our implementation; (3) MeZO is compatible with both full-parameter and parameter-efficient tuning techniques such as LoRA and prefix tuning; (4) MeZO can effectively optimize non-differentiable objectives (e.g., maximizing accuracy or F1). We support our empirical findings with theoretical insights, highlighting how adequate pre-training and task prompts enable MeZO to fine-tune huge models, despite classical ZO analyses suggesting otherwise",

We introduce a novel concept of color-separating sets to provide a complete resolution to this important problem. Specifically, we establish the necessary and sufficient conditions for distinguishing graphs based on the persistence of their connected components, obtained from filter functions on vertex and edge colors. Our constructions expose the limits of vertex- and edge-level PH, proving that neither category subsumes the other. Leveraging these theoretical insights, we propose RePHINE for learning topological features on graphs. RePHINE efficiently combines vertex- and edge-level PH, achieving a scheme that is provably more powerful than both. Integrating RePHINE into MP-GNNs boosts their expressive power, resulting in gains over standard PH on several benchmarks for graph classification",

Previous work had established the sufficiency of finiteness of the fat shattering dimension for PAC learnability and the necessity of finiteness of the scaled Natarajan dimension, but little progress had been made towards a more complete characterization since the work of Simon 1997 (SICOMP '97). To this end, we first introduce a minimax instance optimal learner for realizable regression and propose a novel dimension that both qualitatively and quantitatively characterizes which classes of real-valued predictors are learnable. We then identify a combinatorial dimension related to the graph dimension that characterizes ERM learnability in the realizable setting. Finally, we establish a necessary condition for learnability based on a combinatorial dimension related to the DS dimension, and conjecture that it may also be sufficient in this context. Additionally, in the context of online learning we provide a dimension that characterizes the minimax instance optimal cumulative loss up to a constant factor and design an optimal online learner for realizable regression, thus resolving an open question raised by Daskalakis and Golowich in STOC '22",

    "volume": "oral",
    "abstract": "Offline inverse reinforcement learning (Offline IRL) aims to recover the structure of rewards and environment dynamics that underlie observed actions in a fixed, finite set of demonstrations from an expert agent. Accurate models of expertise in executing a task has applications in safety-sensitive applications such as clinical decision making and autonomous driving. However, the structure of an expert's preferences implicit in observed actions is closely linked to the expert's model of the environment dynamics (i.e. the ``world''). Thus, inaccurate models of the world obtained from finite data with limited coverage could compound inaccuracy in estimated rewards. To address this issue, we propose a bi-level optimization formulation of the estimation task wherein the upper level is likelihood maximization based upon a conservative model of the expert's policy (lower level). The policy model is conservative in that it maximizes reward subject to a penalty that is increasing in the uncertainty of the estimated model of the world. We propose a new algorithmic framework to solve the bi-level optimization problem formulation and provide statistical and computational guarantees of performance for the associated optimal reward estimator. Finally, we demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms the state-of-the-art offline IRL and imitation learning benchmarks by a large margin, over the continuous control tasks in MuJoCo and different datasets in the D4RL benchmark",

    "title": "Bridging RL Theory and Practice with the Effective Horizon",
    "volume": "oral",
    "abstract": "Deep reinforcement learning (RL) works impressively in some environments and fails catastrophically in others. Ideally, RL theory should be able to provide an understanding of why this is, i.e. bounds predictive of practical performance. Unfortunately, current theory does not quite have this ability. We compare standard deep RL algorithms to prior sample complexity bounds by introducing a new dataset, BRIDGE. It consists of 155 MDPs from common deep RL benchmarks, along with their corresponding tabular representations, which enables us to exactly compute instance-dependent bounds. We find that prior bounds do not correlate well with when deep RL succeeds vs. fails, but discover a surprising property that does. When actions with the highest Q-values under the *random* policy also have the highest Q-values under the *optimal* policy—i.e., when it is optimal to act greedily with respect to the random's policy Q function—deep RL tends to succeed; when they don't, deep RL tends to fail. We generalize this property into a new complexity measure of an MDP that we call the *effective horizon*, which roughly corresponds to how many steps of lookahead search would be needed in that MDP in order to identify the next optimal action, when leaf nodes are evaluated with random rollouts. Using BRIDGE, we show that the effective horizon-based bounds are more closely reflective of the empirical performance of PPO and DQN than prior sample complexity bounds across four metrics. We also show that, unlike existing bounds, the effective horizon can predict the effects of using reward shaping or a pre-trained exploration policy.

In this work, we design membership inference attacks to systematically study the privacy provided by knowledge distillation to both the teacher and student training sets. Our new attacks show that distillation alone provides only limited privacy across a number of domains. We explain the success of our attacks on distillation by showing that membership inference attacks on a private dataset can succeed even if the target model is never queried on any actual training points, but only on inputs whose predictions are highly influenced by training data. Finally, we show that our attacks are strongest when student and teacher sets are similar, or when the attacker can poison the teacher set",

SiamMAE operates on pairs of randomly sampled video frames and asymmetrically masks them. These frames are processed independently by an encoder network, and a decoder composed of a sequence of cross-attention layers is tasked with predicting the missing patches in the future frame. By masking a large fraction (95%) of patches in the future frame while leaving the past frame unchanged, SiamMAE encourages the network to focus on object motion and learn object-centric representations. Despite its conceptual simplicity, features learned via SiamMAE outperform state-of-the-art self-supervised methods on video object segmentation, pose keypoint propagation, and semantic part propagation tasks.

Counterintuitively, stochastic gradient descent often produces accurate predictions, even in cases where it does not converge quickly to the optimum. We explain this through a spectral characterization of the implicit bias from non-convergence. We show that stochastic gradient descent produces predictive distributions close to the true posterior both in regions with sufficient data coverage, and in regions sufficiently far away from the data.

    "abstract": "Conventional statistical wisdom established a well-understood relationship between model complexity and prediction error, typically presented as a _U-shaped curve_ reflecting a transition between under- and overfitting regimes. However, motivated by the success of overparametrized neural networks, recent influential work has suggested this theory to be generally incomplete, introducing an additional regime that exhibits a second descent in test error as the parameter count $p$ grows past sample size $n$ -- a phenomenon dubbed _double descent_. While most attention has naturally been given to the deep-learning setting, double descent was shown to emerge more generally across non-neural models: known cases include _linear regression, trees, and boosting_. In this work, we take a closer look at the evidence surrounding these more classical statistical machine learning methods and challenge the claim that observed cases of double descent truly extend the limits of a traditional U-shaped complexity-generalization curve therein. We show that once careful consideration is given to _what is being plotted_ on the x-axes of their double descent plots, it becomes apparent that there are implicitly multiple, distinct complexity axes along which the parameter count grows. We demonstrate that the second descent appears exactly (and _only_) when and where the transition between these underlying axes occurs, and that its location is thus _not_ inherently tied to the interpolation threshold $p=n$. We then gain further insight by adopting a classical nonparametric statistics perspective. We interpret the investigated methods as _smoothers_ and propose a generalized measure for the _effective_ number of parameters they use _on unseen examples_, using which we find that their apparent double descent curves do indeed fold back into more traditional convex shapes -- providing a resolution to the ostensible tension between double descent and traditional statistical intuition",

This class is known to be more general than linear MDPs, where the transition kernel and the reward function are assumed to be linear functions of the feature vectors. As our first contribution, we show that the difference between the two classes is the presence of states in linearly $q^\\pi$-realizable MDPs where for any policy, all the actions have approximately equal values, and skipping over these states by following an arbitrarily fixed policy in those states transforms the problem to a linear MDP. Based on this observation, we derive a novel (computationally inefficient) learning algorithm for linearly $q^\\pi$-realizable MDPs that simultaneously learns what states should be skipped over and runs another learning algorithm on the linear MDP hidden in the problem. The method returns an $\\epsilon$-optimal policy after $\\text{polylog}(H, d)/\\epsilon^2$ interactions with the MDP, where $H$ is the time horizon and $d$ is the dimension of the feature vectors, giving the first polynomial-sample-complexity online RL algorithm for this setting.

    "title": "Tree of Thoughts: Deliberate Problem Solving with Large Language Models",
    "volume": "oral",
    "abstract": "Language models are increasingly being deployed for general problem solving across a wide range of tasks, but are still confined to token-level, left-to-right decision-making processes during inference. This means they can fall short in tasks that require exploration, strategic lookahead, or where initial decisions play a pivotal role. To surmount these challenges, we introduce a new framework for language model inference, Tree of Thoughts (ToT), which generalizes over the popular Chain of Thought approach to prompting language models, and enables exploration over coherent units of text (thoughts) that serve as intermediate steps toward problem solving. ToT allows LMs to perform deliberate decision making by considering multiple different reasoning paths and self-evaluating choices to decide the next course of action, as well as looking ahead or backtracking when necessary to make global choices. Our experiments show that ToT significantly enhances language models' problem-solving abilities on three novel tasks requiring non-trivial planning or search: Game of 24, Creative Writing, and Mini Crosswords. For instance, in Game of 24, while GPT-4 with chain-of-thought prompting only solved 4\\% of tasks, our method achieved a success rate of 74\\%.

    "abstract": "Contrastive pretraining on image-text pairs from the web is one of the most popular large-scale pretraining strategies for vision backbones, especially in the context of large multimodal models. At the same time, image captioning on this type of data is commonly considered an inferior pretraining strategy. In this paper, we perform a fair comparison of these two pretraining strategies, carefully matching training data, compute, and model capacity. Using a standard encoder-decoder transformer, we find that captioning alone is surprisingly effective: on classification tasks, captioning produces vision encoders competitive with contrastively pretrained encoders, while surpassing them on vision & language tasks. We further analyze the effect of the model architecture and scale, as well as the pretraining data on the representation quality, and find that captioning exhibits the same or better scaling behavior along these axes. Overall our results show that plain image captioning is a more powerful pretraining strategy than was previously believed",

    "volume": "oral",
    "abstract": "The current trend of scaling language models involves increasing both parameter count and training dataset size. Extrapolating this trend suggests that training dataset size may soon be limited by the amount of text data available on the internet. Motivated by this limit, we investigate scaling language models in data-constrained regimes. Specifically, we run a large set of experiments varying the extent of data repetition and compute budget, ranging up to 900 billion training tokens and 9 billion parameter models. We find that with constrained data for a fixed compute budget, training with up to 4 epochs of repeated data yields negligible changes to loss compared to having unique data. However, with more repetition, the value of adding compute eventually decays to zero. We propose and empirically validate a scaling law for compute optimality that accounts for the decreasing value of repeated tokens and excess parameters. Finally, we experiment with approaches mitigating data scarcity, including augmenting the training dataset with code data or removing commonly used filters.

    "abstract": "Task arithmetic has recently emerged as a cost-effective and scalable approach to edit pre-trained models directly in weight space: By adding the fine-tuned weights of different tasks, the model's performance can be improved on these tasks, while negating them leads to task forgetting. Yet, our understanding of the effectiveness of task arithmetic and its underlying principles remains limited. We present a comprehensive study of task arithmetic in vision-language models and show that weight disentanglement is the crucial factor that makes it effective. This property arises during pre-training and manifests when distinct directions in weight space govern separate, localized regions in function space associated with the tasks. Notably, we show that fine-tuning models in their tangent space by linearizing them amplifies weight disentanglement. This leads to substantial performance improvements across multiple task arithmetic benchmarks and diverse models. Building on these findings, we provide theoretical and empirical analyses of the neural tangent kernel (NTK) of these models and establish a compelling link between task arithmetic and the spatial localization of the NTK eigenfunctions. Overall, our work uncovers novel insights into the fundamental mechanisms of task arithmetic and offers a more reliable and effective approach to edit pre-trained models through the NTK linearization",

We also develop a differentially private algorithm for the multiway $k$-cut problem, in which we are given $k$ nodes as terminals that we would like to disconnect. As a function of $k$, we obtain privacy guarantees that are exponentially more efficient than applying the advanced composition theorem to known algorithms for multiway $k$-cut.

    "abstract": "A private learner is trained on a sample of labeled points and generatesa hypothesis that can be used for predicting the labels of newly sampled points while protecting the privacy of the training set [Kasiviswannathan et al., FOCS 2008]. Research uncovered that private learners may need to exhibit significantly higher sample complexity than non-private learners as is the case with, e.g., learning of one-dimensional threshold functions [Bun et al., FOCS 2015, Alon et al., STOC 2019]. We explore prediction as an alternative to learning. Instead of putting forward a hypothesis, a predictor answers a stream of classification queries. Earlier work has considered a private prediction model with just a single classification query [Dwork and Feldman, COLT 2018]. We observe that when answering a stream of queries, a predictor must modify the hypothesis it uses over time, and, furthermore, that it must use the queries for this modification, hence introducing potential privacy risks with respect to the queries themselves. We introduce private everlasting prediction taking into account the privacy of both the training set and the (adaptively chosen) queries made to the predictor. We then present a generic construction of private everlasting predictors in the PAC model. The sample complexity of the initial training sample in our construction is quadratic (up to polylog factors) in the VC dimension of the concept class. Our construction allows prediction for all concept classes with finite VC dimension, and in particular threshold functions with constant size initial training sample, even when considered over infinite domains, whereas it is known that the sample complexity of privately learning threshold functions must grow as a function of the domain size and hence is impossible for infinite domains",

    "abstract": "Integrating large language models (LLMs) with various tools has led to increased attention in the field. Existing approaches either involve fine-tuning the LLM, which is both computationally costly and limited to a fixed set of tools, or prompting LLMs by in-context tool demonstrations. Although the latter method offers adaptability to new tools, it struggles with the inherent context length constraint of LLMs when many new tools are presented, and mastering a new set of tools with few-shot examples remains challenging, resulting in suboptimal performance. To address these limitations, we propose a novel solution, named **ToolkenGPT**, wherein LLMs effectively learn to master tools as predicting tokens through **tool embeddings** for solving complex tasks. In this framework, each tool is transformed into vector embeddings and plugged into the language model head. Once the function is triggered during text generation, the LLM enters a special function mode to execute the tool calls.

In this paper, we take a first step towards theoretically answering these questions. Specifically, we examine the \\emph{expressivity} of LLMs with CoT in solving fundamental mathematical and decision-making problems. By using circuit complexity theory, we first give impossibility results showing that bounded-depth Transformers are unable to directly produce correct answers for basic arithmetic/equation tasks unless the model size grows \\emph{super-polynomially} with respect to the input length. In contrast, we then prove by construction that autoregressive Transformers of \\emph{constant size} suffice to solve both tasks by generating CoT derivations using a commonly used math language format. Moreover, we show LLMs with CoT can handle a general class of decision-making problems known as Dynamic Programming, thus justifying its power in tackling complex real-world tasks.

Empirically, we show the performance of the method on several large-scale EOT tasks. The code for the ENOT solver can be found at https://github.com/ngushchin/EntropicNeuralOptimalTransport",

    "volume": "oral",
    "abstract": "Neural sequence models based on the transformer architecture have demonstrated remarkable \\emph{in-context learning} (ICL) abilities, where they can perform new tasks when prompted with training and test examples, without any parameter update to the model. This work first provides a comprehensive statistical theory for transformers to perform ICL. Concretely, we show that transformers can implement a broad class of standard machine learning algorithms in context, such as least squares, ridge regression, Lasso, learning generalized linear models, and gradient descent on two-layer neural networks, with near-optimal predictive power on various in-context data distributions. Using an efficient implementation of in-context gradient descent as the underlying mechanism, our transformer constructions admit mild size bounds, and can be learned with polynomially many pretraining sequences. Building on these ``base'' ICL algorithms, intriguingly, we show that transformers can implement more complex ICL procedures involving \\emph{in-context algorithm selection}, akin to what a statistician can do in real life---A \\emph{single} transformer can adaptively select different base ICL algorithms---or even perform qualitatively different tasks---on different input sequences, without any explicit prompting of the right algorithm or task. We both establish this in theory by explicit constructions, and also observe this phenomenon experimentally. In theory, we construct two general mechanisms for algorithm selection with concrete examples: pre-ICL testing, and post-ICL validation. As an example, we use the post-ICL validation mechanism to construct a transformer that can perform nearly Bayes-optimal ICL on a challenging task---noisy linear models with mixed noise levels. Experimentally, we demonstrate the strong in-context algorithm selection capabilities of standard transformer architectures",

We view causality both as an extension of probability theory and as a study of what happens when one intervenes on a system, and argue in favour of taking Kolmogorov's measure-theoretic axiomatisation of probability as the starting point towards an axiomatisation of causality. To that end, we propose the notion of a causal space, consisting of a probability space along with a collection of transition probability kernels, called causal kernels, that encode the causal information of the space. Our proposed framework is not only rigorously grounded in measure theory, but it also sheds light on long-standing limitations of existing frameworks including, for example, cycles, latent variables and stochastic processes",

    "abstract": "Understanding the geometric properties of gradient descent dynamics is a key ingredient in deciphering the recent success of very large machine learning models. A striking observation is that trained over-parameterized models retain some properties of the optimization initialization. This \"implicit bias\" is believed to be responsible for some favorable properties of the trained models and could explain their good generalization properties. The purpose of this article is threefold. First, we rigorously expose the definition and basic properties of \"conservation laws\", that define quantities conserved during gradient flows of a given model (e.g. of a ReLU network with a given architecture) with any training data and any loss. Then we explain how to find the maximal number of independent conservation laws by performing finite-dimensional algebraic manipulations on the Lie algebra generated by the Jacobian of the model. Finally, we provide algorithms to: a) compute a family of polynomial laws; b) compute the maximal number of (not necessarily polynomial) independent conservation laws. We provide showcase examples that we fully work out theoretically. Besides, applying the two algorithms confirms for a number of ReLU network architectures that all known laws are recovered by the algorithm, and that there are no other independent laws. Such computational tools pave the way to understanding desirable properties of optimization initialization in large machine learning models",

    "abstract": "Large language models trained for safety and harmlessness remain susceptible to adversarial misuse, as evidenced by the prevalence of \"jailbreak\" attacks on early releases of ChatGPT that elicit undesired behavior. Going beyond recognition of the issue, we investigate why such attacks succeed and how they can be created. We hypothesize two failure modes of safety training: competing objectives and mismatched generalization. Competing objectives arise when a model's capabilities and safety goals conflict, while mismatched generalization occurs when safety training fails to generalize to a domain for which capabilities exist. We use these failure modes to guide jailbreak design and then evaluate state-of-the-art models, including OpenAI's GPT-4 and Anthropic's Claude v1.3, against both existing and newly designed attacks. We find that vulnerabilities persist despite the extensive red-teaming and safety-training efforts behind these models. Notably, new attacks utilizing our failure modes succeed on every prompt in a collection of unsafe requests from the models' red-teaming evaluation sets and outperform existing ad hoc jailbreaks. Our analysis emphasizes the need for safety-capability parity—that safety mechanisms should be as sophisticated as the underlying model—and argues against the idea that scaling alone can resolve these safety failure modes",

Probabilistic circuits (PCs), a prominent family of tractable probabilistic models, offer a remedy to this challenge by composing simple, tractable distributions into a high-dimensional probability distribution. However, learning PCs on heterogeneous data is challenging and densities of some parametric distributions are not available in closed form, limiting their potential use. We introduce characteristic circuits (CCs), a family of tractable probabilistic models providing a unified formalization of distributions over heterogeneous data in the spectral domain. The one-to-one relationship between characteristic functions and probability measures enables us to learn high-dimensional distributions on heterogeneous data domains and facilitates efficient probabilistic inference even when no closed-form density function is available. We show that the structure and parameters of CCs can be learned efficiently from the data and find that CCs outperform state-of-the-art density estimators for heterogeneous data domains on common benchmark data sets",

    "volume": "oral",
    "abstract": "Nonlinear independent component analysis (ICA) aims to uncover the true latent sources from their observable nonlinear mixtures. Despite its significance, the identifiability of nonlinear ICA is known to be impossible without additional assumptions. Recent advances have proposed conditions on the connective structure from sources to observed variables, known as Structural Sparsity, to achieve identifiability in an unsupervised manner. However, the sparsity constraint may not hold universally for all sources in practice. Furthermore, the assumptions of bijectivity of the mixing process and independence among all sources, which arise from the setting of ICA, may also be violated in many real-world scenarios. To address these limitations and generalize nonlinear ICA, we propose a set of new identifiability results in the general settings of undercompleteness, partial sparsity and source dependence, and flexible grouping structures. Specifically, we prove identifiability when there are more observed variables than sources (undercomplete), and when certain sparsity and/or source independence assumptions are not met for some changing sources. Moreover, we show that even in cases with flexible grouping structures (e.g., part of the sources can be divided into irreducible independent groups with various sizes), appropriate identifiability results can also be established. Theoretical claims are supported empirically on both synthetic and real-world datasets",

    "abstract": "Reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms face two distinct challenges: learning effective representations of past and present observations, and determining how actions influence future returns. Both challenges involve modeling long-term dependencies. The Transformer architecture has been very successful to solve problems that involve long-term dependencies, including in the RL domain. However, the underlying reason for the strong performance of Transformer-based RL methods remains unclear: is it because they learn effective memory, or because they perform effective credit assignment? After introducing formal definitions of memory length and credit assignment length, we design simple configurable tasks to measure these distinct quantities. Our empirical results reveal that Transformers can enhance the memory capability of RL algorithms, scaling up to tasks that require memorizing observations $1500$ steps ago. However, Transformers do not improve long-term credit assignment. In summary, our results provide an explanation for the success of Transformers in RL, while also highlighting an important area for future research and benchmark design.

    "abstract": "Face recognition systems are widely deployed in safety-critical applications, including law enforcement, yet they exhibit bias across a range of socio-demographic dimensions, such as gender and race. Conventional wisdom dictates that model biases arise from biased training data. As a consequence, previous works on bias mitigation largely focused on pre-processing the training data, adding penalties to prevent bias from effecting the model during training, or post-processing predictions to debias them, yet these approaches have shown limited success on hard problems such as face recognition. In our work, we discover that biases are actually inherent to neural network architectures themselves. Following this reframing, we conduct the first neural architecture search for fairness, jointly with a search for hyperparameters. Our search outputs a suite of models which Pareto-dominate all other high-performance architectures and existing bias mitigation methods in terms of accuracy and fairness, often by large margins, on the two most widely used datasets for face identification, CelebA and VGGFace2.

    "title": "Information Maximization Perspective of Orthogonal Matching Pursuit with Applications to Explainable AI",
    "volume": "spotlight",
    "abstract": "Information Pursuit (IP) is a classical active testing algorithm for predicting an output by sequentially and greedily querying the input in order of information gain. However, IP is computationally intensive since it involves estimating mutual information in high-dimensional spaces. This paper explores Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (OMP) as an alternative to IP for greedily selecting the queries. OMP is a classical signal processing algorithm for sequentially encoding a signal in terms of dictionary atoms chosen in order of correlation gain. In each iteration, OMP selects the atom that is most correlated with the signal residual (the signal minus its reconstruction thus far). Our first contribution is to establish a fundamental connection between IP and OMP, where we prove that IP with random projections of dictionary atoms as queries ``almost'' reduces to OMP, with the difference being that IP selects atoms in order of normalized correlation gain. We call this version IP-OMP and present simulations indicating that this difference does not have any appreciable effect on the sparse code recovery rate of IP-OMP compared to that of OMP for random Gaussian dictionaries. Inspired by this connection, our second contribution is to explore the utility of IP-OMP for generating explainable predictions, an area in which IP has recently gained traction. More specifically, we propose a simple explainable AI algorithm which encodes an image as a sparse combination of semantically meaningful dictionary atoms that are defined as text embeddings of interpretable concepts. The final prediction is made using the weights of this sparse combination, which serve as an explanation. Empirically, our proposed algorithm is not only competitive with existing explainability methods but also computationally less expensive",

This work introduces an instruction-tuned Video Pretraining (VPT) model for Minecraft called STEVE-1, demonstrating that the unCLIP approach, utilized in DALL•E 2, is also effective for creating instruction-following sequential decision-making agents. STEVE-1 is trained in two steps: adapting the pretrained VPT model to follow commands in MineCLIP's latent space, then training a prior to predict latent codes from text. This allows us to finetune VPT through self-supervised behavioral cloning and hindsight relabeling, bypassing the need for costly human text annotations. By leveraging pretrained models like VPT and MineCLIP and employing best practices from text-conditioned image generation, STEVE-1 costs just $60 to train and can follow short-horizon open-ended text and visual instructions in Minecraft. STEVE-1 sets a new bar for open-ended instruction following in Minecraft with low-level controls (mouse and keyboard) and raw pixel inputs, far outperforming previous baselines and robustly completing 12 of 13 tasks in our early-game evaluation suite.

In this paper, we prove that, under relatively mild assumptions, the suboptimality of ERM must be due to its bias. Namely, the variance error term of ERM (in terms of the bias and variance decomposition) enjoys the minimax rate. In the fixed design setting, we provide an elementary proof of this result using the probabilistic method. Then, we extend our proof to the random design setting for various models. In addition, we provide a simple proof of Chatterjee's admissibility theorem (Chatterjee, 2014, Theorem 1.4), which states that in the fixed design setting, ERM cannot be ruled out as an optimal method, and then we extend this result to the random design setting. We also show that our estimates imply stability of ERM, complementing the main result of Caponnetto and Rakhlin (2006) for non-Donsker classes. Finally, we highlight the somewhat irregular nature of the loss landscape of ERM in the non-Donsker regime, by showing that functions can be close to ERM, in terms of $L_2$ distance, while still being far from almost-minimizers of the empirical loss",

Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF)---where human preference judgments on LM outputs are transformed into a learning signal---has recently shown promise in addressing these issues. However, such holistic feedback conveys limited information on long text outputs; it does not indicate which aspects of the outputs influenced user preference; e.g., which parts contain what type(s) of errors. In this paper, we use fine-grained human feedback (e.g., which sentence is false, which sub-sentence is irrelevant) as an explicit training signal. We introduce Fine-Grained RLHF, a framework that enables training and learning from reward functions that are fine-grained in two respects: (1) density, providing a reward after every segment (e.g., a sentence) is generated; and (2) incorporating multiple reward models associated with different feedback types (e.g., factual incorrectness, irrelevance, and information incompleteness). We conduct experiments on detoxification and long-form question answering to illustrate how learning with this reward function leads to improved performance, supported by both automatic and human evaluation. Additionally, we show that LM behaviors can be customized using different combinations of fine-grained reward models.

Most recently, machine vision has seen remarkable progress by scaling neural networks to unprecedented levels in dataset and model size. We here ask whether this extraordinary increase in scale also positively impacts the field of mechanistic interpretability. In other words, has our understanding of the inner workings of scaled neural networks improved as well? We use a psychophysical paradigm to quantify one form of mechanistic interpretability for a diverse suite of nine models and find no scaling effect for interpretability - neither for model nor dataset size. Specifically, none of the investigated state-of-the-art models are easier to interpret than the GoogLeNet model from almost a decade ago. Latest-generation vision models appear even less interpretable than older architectures, hinting at a regression rather than improvement, with modern models sacrificing interpretability for accuracy. These results highlight the need for models explicitly designed to be mechanistically interpretable and the need for more helpful interpretability methods to increase our understanding of networks at an atomic level. We release a dataset containing more than 130'000 human responses from our psychophysical evaluation of 767 units across nine models.

Furthermore, our new lower bounds are akin to an information-theoretic strong converse: they establish that the misclassification rate goes to 0 or 1 asymptotically. One surprising consequence of our tight results is that the min-norm interpolating classifier can be asymptotically suboptimal relative to noninterpolating classifiers in the regime where the min-norm interpolating regressor is known to be optimal. The key to our tight analysis is a new variant of the Hanson-Wright inequality which is broadly useful for multiclass problems with sparse labels.

This trade-off is typically enabled by a scaling rule, for example, in stochastic gradient descent, one should scale the learning rate linearly with the batch size. Another important machine learning tool is the model EMA, a functional copy of a target model, whose parameters move towards those of its target model according to an Exponential Moving Average (EMA) at a rate parameterized by a momentum hyperparameter. This model EMA can improve the robustness and generalization of supervised learning, stabilize pseudo-labeling, and provide a learning signal for Self-Supervised Learning (SSL). Prior works have not considered the optimization of the model EMA when performing scaling, leading to different training dynamics across batch sizes and lower model performance. In this work, we provide a scaling rule for optimization in the presence of a model EMA and demonstrate the rule's validity across a range of architectures, optimizers, and data modalities. We also show the rule's validity where the model EMA contributes to the optimization of the target model, enabling us to train EMA-based pseudo-labeling and SSL methods at small and large batch sizes. For SSL, we enable training of BYOL up to batch size 24,576 without sacrificing performance, a 6$\\times$ wall-clock time reduction under idealized hardware settings",

    "abstract": "Language models have been successfully used to model natural signals, such as images, speech, and music. A key component of these models is a high quality neural compression model that can compress high-dimensional natural signals into lower dimensional discrete tokens. To that end, we introduce a high-fidelity universal neural audio compression algorithm that achieves ~90x compression of 44.1 KHz audio into tokens at just 8kbps bandwidth. We achieve this by combining advances in high-fidelity audio generation with better vector quantization techniques from the image domain, along with improved adversarial and reconstruction losses. We compress all domains (speech, environment, music, etc.) with a single universal model, making it widely applicable to generative modeling of all audio. We compare with competing audio compression algorithms, and find our method outperforms them significantly. We provide thorough ablations for every design choice, as well as open-source code and trained model weights. We hope our work can lay the foundation for the next generation of high-fidelity audio modeling",

    "abstract": "While policy optimization algorithms have played an important role in recent empirical success of Reinforcement Learning (RL), the existing theoretical understanding of policy optimization remains rather limited---they are either restricted to tabular MDPs or suffer from highly suboptimal sample complexity, especial in online RL where exploration is necessary. This paper proposes a simple efficient policy optimization framework---Optimistic NPG for online RL. Optimistic NPG can be viewed as simply combining of the classic natural policy gradient (NPG) algorithm [Kakade, 2001] with optimistic policy evaluation subroutines to encourage exploration. For $d$-dimensional linear MDPs, Optimistic NPG is computationally efficient, and learns an $\\epsilon$-optimal policy within $\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}(d^2/\\epsilon^3)$ samples, which is the first computationally efficient algorithm whose sample complexity has the optimal dimension dependence $\\tilde{\\Theta}(d^2)$. It also improves over state-of-the-art results of policy optimization algorithms [Zanette et al., 2021] by a factor of $d$. For general function approximation that subsumes linear MDPs, Optimistic NPG, to our best knowledge, is also the first policy optimization algorithm that achieves the polynomial sample complexity for learning near-optimal policies",

On the other hand, prior works have also observed that deep networks can be under-sensitive, wherein large-magnitude perturbations in input space do not induce appreciable changes to network activations. In this work, we study in detail the phenomenon of under-sensitivity in vision models such as CNNs and Transformers, and present techniques to study the geometry and extent of \"equi-confidence\" level sets of such networks. We propose a Level Set Traversal algorithm that iteratively explores regions of high confidence with respect to the input space using orthogonal components of the local gradients. Given a source image, we use this algorithm to identify inputs that lie in the same equi-confidence level set as the source image despite being perceptually similar to arbitrary images from other classes. We further observe that the source image is linearly connected by a high-confidence path to these inputs, uncovering a star-like structure for level sets of deep networks. Furthermore, we attempt to identify and estimate the extent of these connected higher-dimensional regions over which the model maintains a high degree of confidence",

While some success has been found in building representations of animal behavior under constrained or simplified task-based conditions, many of these models cannot be applied to free and naturalistic settings where behavior becomes increasingly hard to model. In this work, we develop a multi-task representation learning model for animal behavior that combines two novel components: (i) an action-prediction objective that aims to predict the distribution of actions over future timesteps, and (ii) a multi-scale architecture that builds separate latent spaces to accommodate short- and long-term dynamics. After demonstrating the ability of the method to build representations of both local and global dynamics in robots in varying environments and terrains, we apply our method to the MABe 2022 Multi-Agent Behavior challenge, where our model ranks first overall on both mice and fly benchmarks.

In this paper, we further generalize this non-uniform smoothness condition and develop a simple, yet powerful analysis technique that bounds the gradients along the trajectory, thereby leading to stronger results for both convex and non-convex optimization problems. In particular, we obtain the classical convergence rates for (stochastic) gradient descent and Nesterov's accelerated gradient method in the convex and/or non-convex setting under this general smoothness condition.

We propose using neural samplers that specify implicit distributions, which are well-suited for approximating complex multimodal and correlated posteriors in high-dimensional spaces. Our approach introduces novel bounds for approximate inference using implicit distributions by locally linearising the neural sampler. This is distinct from existing methods that rely on additional discriminator networks and unstable adversarial objectives. Furthermore, we present a new sampler architecture that, for the first time, enables implicit distributions over tens of millions of latent variables, addressing computational concerns by using differentiable numerical approximations. We empirically show that our method is capable of recovering correlations across layers in large Bayesian neural networks, a property that is crucial for a network's performance but notoriously challenging to achieve. To the best of our knowledge, no other method has been shown to accomplish this task for such large models.

On a higher level, our approach is agnostic to the unknown types and curvatures of the online functions, while at a lower level, it can exploit the unknown niceness of the environments and attain problem-dependent guarantees. Specifically, we obtain $\\mathcal{O}(\\log V_T)$, $\\mathcal{O}(d \\log V_T)$ and $\\hat{\\mathcal{O}}(\\sqrt{V_T})$ regret bounds for strongly convex, exp-concave and convex loss functions, respectively, where $d$ is the dimension, $V_T$ denotes problem-dependent gradient variations and the $\\hat{\\mathcal{O}}(\\cdot)$-notation omits $\\log V_T$ factors. Our result not only safeguards the worst-case guarantees but also directly implies the small-loss bounds in analysis. Moreover, when applied to adversarial/stochastic convex optimization and game theory problems, our result enhances the existing universal guarantees. Our approach is based on a multi-layer online ensemble framework incorporating novel ingredients, including a carefully designed optimism for unifying diverse function types and cascaded corrections for algorithmic stability. Notably, despite its multi-layer structure, our algorithm necessitates only one gradient query per round, making it favorable when the gradient evaluation is time-consuming.

However, incorporating predictions into data structures with strong theoretical guarantees remains underdeveloped. This paper takes a step in this direction by showing that predictions can be leveraged in the fundamental online list labeling problem. In the problem, $n$ items arrive over time and must be stored in sorted order in an array of size $\\Theta(n)$. The array slot of an element is its label and the goal is to maintain sorted order while minimizing the total number of elements moved (i.e., relabeled). We design a new list labeling data structure and bound its performance in two models. In the worst-case learning-augmented model, we give guarantees in terms of the error in the predictions. Our data structure provides strong guarantees: it is optimal for any prediction error and guarantees the best-known worst-case bound even when the predictions are entirely erroneous. We also consider a stochastic error model and bound the performance in terms of the expectation and variance of the error. Finally, the theoretical results are demonstrated empirically. In particular, we show that our data structure has strong performance on real temporal data sets where predictions are constructed from elements that arrived in the past, as is typically done in a practical use case",

We explore whether LLMs can take on, that is impersonate, different roles when they generate text in-context. We ask LLMs to assume different personas before solving vision and language tasks. We do this by prefixing the prompt with a persona that is associated either with a social identity or domain expertise. In a multi-armed bandit task, we find that LLMs pretending to be children of different ages recover human-like developmental stages of exploration. In a language-based reasoning task, we find that LLMs impersonating domain experts perform better than LLMs impersonating non-domain experts. Finally, we test whether LLMs' impersonations are complementary to visual information when describing different categories. We find that impersonation can improve performance: an LLM prompted to be a bird expert describes birds better than one prompted to be a car expert. However, impersonation can also uncover LLMs' biases: an LLM prompted to be a man describes cars better than one prompted to be a woman.

    "abstract": "Solving the quantum many-body Schrödinger equation is a fundamental and challenging problem in the fields of quantum physics, quantum chemistry, and material sciences. One of the common computational approaches to this problem is Quantum Variational Monte Carlo (QVMC), in which ground-state solutions are obtained by minimizing the energy of the system within a restricted family of parameterized wave functions. Deep learning methods partially address the limitations of traditional QVMC by representing a rich family of wave functions in terms of neural networks. However, the optimization objective in QVMC remains notoriously hard to minimize and requires second-order optimization methods such as natural gradient. In this paper, we first reformulate energy functional minimization in the space of Born distributions corresponding to particle-permutation (anti-)symmetric wave functions, rather than the space of wave functions. We then interpret QVMC as the Fisher--Rao gradient flow in this distributional space, followed by a projection step onto the variational manifold. This perspective provides us with a principled framework to derive new QMC algorithms, by endowing the distributional space with better metrics, and following the projected gradient flow induced by those metrics. More specifically, we propose ``Wasserstein Quantum Monte Carlo'' (WQMC), which uses the gradient flow induced by the Wasserstein metrics, rather than Fisher--Rao metric, and corresponds to *transporting* the probability mass, rather than *teleporting* it. We demonstrate empirically that the dynamics of WQMC results in faster convergence to the ground state of molecular systems",

This begs the question: Can SSL algorithms simultaneously improve upon both UL and SL? To this end, we derive a tight lower bound for 2-Gaussian mixture models that explicitly depends on the labeled and the unlabeled dataset size as well as the signal-to-noise ratio of the mixture distribution. Surprisingly, our result implies that no SSL algorithm improves upon the minimax-optimal statistical error rates of SL or UL algorithms for these distributions. Nevertheless, in our real-world experiments, SSL algorithms can often outperform UL and SL algorithms.

Additionally, even when accounting for all possible explanations for a given dataset, these insights may not generalize because not all good explanations are stable across reasonable data perturbations. We propose a new variable importance framework that quantifies the importance of a variable across the set of all good models and is stable across the data distribution. Our framework is extremely flexible and can be integrated with most existing model classes and global variable importance metrics. We demonstrate through experiments that our framework recovers variable importance rankings for complex simulation setups where other methods fail.

    "abstract": "Data valuation, a growing field that aims at quantifying the usefulness of individual data sources for training machine learning (ML) models, faces notable yet often overlooked privacy challenges. This paper studies these challenges with a focus on KNN-Shapley, one of the most practical data valuation methods nowadays. We first emphasize the inherent privacy risks of KNN-Shapley, and demonstrate the significant technical challenges in adapting KNN-Shapley to accommodate differential privacy (DP). To overcome these challenges, we introduce TKNN-Shapley, a refined variant of KNN-Shapley that is privacy-friendly, allowing for straightforward modifications to incorporate DP guarantee (DP-TKNN-Shapley). We show that DP-TKNN-Shapley has several advantages and offers a superior privacy-utility tradeoff compared to naively privatized KNN-Shapley. Moreover, even non-private TKNN-Shapley matches KNN-Shapley's performance in discerning data quality. Overall, our findings suggest that TKNN-Shapley is a promising alternative to KNN-Shapley, particularly for real-world applications involving sensitive data",

    "abstract": "Cooperative communication plays a fundamental role in theories of human-human interaction--cognition, culture, development, language, etc.--as well as human-robot interaction. The core challenge in cooperative communication is the problem of common ground: having enough shared knowledge and understanding to successfully communicate. Prior models of cooperative communication, however, uniformly assume the strongest form of common ground, perfect and complete knowledge sharing, and, therefore, fail to capture the core challenge of cooperative communication. We propose a general theory of cooperative communication that is mathematically principled and explicitly defines a spectrum of common ground possibilities, going well beyond that of perfect and complete knowledge sharing, on spaces that permit arbitrary representations of data and hypotheses. Our framework is a strict generalization of prior models of cooperative communication. After considering a parametric form of common ground and viewing the data selection and hypothesis inference processes of communication as encoding and decoding, we establish a connection to variational autoencoding, a powerful model in modern machine learning. Finally, we carry out a series of empirical simulations to support and elaborate on our theoretical results",

    "abstract": "This paper focuses on supervised and unsupervised online label shift, where the class marginals $Q(y)$ varies but the class-conditionals $Q(x|y)$ remain invariant. In the unsupervised setting, our goal is to adapt a learner, trained on some offline labeled data, to changing label distributions given unlabeled online data. In the supervised setting, we must both learn a classifier and adapt to the dynamically evolving class marginals given only labeled online data. We develop novel algorithms that reduce the adaptation problem to online regression and guarantee optimal dynamic regret without any prior knowledge of the extent of drift in the label distribution. Our solution is based on bootstrapping the estimates of *online regression oracles* that track the drifting proportions. Experiments across numerous simulated and real-world online label shift scenarios demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed approaches, often achieving 1-3% improvement in accuracy while being sample and computationally efficient.

    "title": "Locality Sensitive Hashing in Fourier Frequency Domain For Soft Set Containment Search",
    "volume": "spotlight",
    "abstract": "In many search applications related to passage retrieval, text entailment, and subgraph search, the query and each 'document' is a set of elements, with a document being relevant if it contains the query. These elements are not represented by atomic IDs, but by embedded representations, thereby extending set containment to *soft* set containment. Recent applications address soft set containment by encoding sets into fixed-size vectors and checking for elementwise *vector* *dominance*. This 0/1 property can be relaxed to an asymmetric *hinge* *distance* for scoring and ranking candidate documents. Here we focus on data-sensitive, trainable indices for fast retrieval of relevant documents. Existing LSH methods are designed for mostly symmetric or few simple asymmetric distance functions, which are not suitable for hinge distance. Instead, we transform hinge distance into a proposed *dominance* *similarity* measure, to which we then apply a Fourier transform, thereby expressing dominance similarity as an expectation of inner products of functions in the frequency domain. Next, we approximate the expectation with an importance-sampled estimate. The overall consequence is that now we can use a traditional LSH, but in the frequency domain. To ensure that the LSH uses hash bits efficiently, we learn hash functions that are sensitive to both corpus and query distributions, mapped to the frequency domain. Our experiments show that the proposed asymmetric dominance similarity is critical to the targeted applications, and that our LSH, which we call FourierHashNet, provides a better query time vs. retrieval quality trade-off, compared to several baselines. Both the Fourier transform and the trainable hash codes contribute to performance gains",

    "volume": "spotlight",
    "abstract": "Language models learn a great quantity of factual information during pretraining, and recent work localizes this information to specific model weights like mid-layer MLP weights. In this paper, we find that we can change how a fact is stored in a model by editing weights that are in a different location than where existing methods suggest that the fact is stored. This is surprising because we would expect that localizing facts to specific model parameters would tell us where to manipulate knowledge in models, and this assumption has motivated past work on model editing methods. Specifically, we show that localization conclusions from representation denoising (also known as Causal Tracing) do not provide any insight into which model MLP layer would be best to edit in order to override an existing stored fact with a new one. This finding raises questions about how past work relies on Causal Tracing to select which model layers to edit. Next, we consider several variants of the editing problem, including erasing and amplifying facts. For one of our editing problems, editing performance does relate to localization results from representation denoising, but we find that which layer we edit is a far better predictor of performance. Our results suggest, counterintuitively, that better mechanistic understanding of how pretrained language models work may not always translate to insights about how to best change their behavior",

We tackle this challenge by introducing a notion of group fairness, called the core, which requires that every possible community (subset of researchers) to be treated in a way that prevents them from unilaterally benefiting by withdrawing from a large conference.

In particular, their learning-augmented frequency estimation algorithm uses a learned heavy-hitter oracle which predicts which elements will appear many times in the stream. We give a novel algorithm, which in some parameter regimes, already theoretically outperforms the learning based algorithm of Hsu et al. *without* the use of any predictions.

The key technical innovations are to understand how hierarchical information in this model translates into tree geometry which can be recovered from data, and to characterise the benefits of simultaneously growing sample size and data dimension.

    "abstract": "Despite widespread use of LLMs as conversational agents, evaluations of performance fail to capture a crucial aspect of communication: interpreting language in context---incorporating its pragmatics. Humans interpret language using beliefs and prior knowledge about the world. For example, we intuitively understand the response \"I wore gloves\" to the question \"Did you leave fingerprints?\" as meaning \"No\". To investigate whether LLMs have the ability to make this type of inference, known as an implicature, we design a simple task and evaluate four categories of widely used state-of-the-art models. We find that, despite only evaluating on utterances that require a binary inference (yes or no), models in three of these categories perform close to random. However, LLMs instruction-tuned at the example-level perform significantly better. These results suggest that certain fine-tuning strategies are far better at inducing pragmatic understanding in models. We present our findings as the starting point for further research into evaluating how LLMs interpret language in context and to drive the development of more pragmatic and useful models of human discourse",

    "abstract": "Transformers have surpassed RNNs in popularity due to their superior abilities in parallel training and long-term dependency modeling. Recently, there has been a renewed interest in using linear RNNs for efficient sequence modeling. These linear RNNs often employ gating mechanisms in the output of the linear recurrence layer while ignoring the significance of using forget gates within the recurrence. In this paper, we propose a gated linear RNN model dubbed Hierarchically Gated Recurrent Neural Network (HGRN), which includes forget gates that are lower bounded by a learnable value. The lower bound increases monotonically when moving up layers. This allows the upper layers to model long-term dependencies and the lower layers to model more local, short-term dependencies. Experiments on language modeling, image classification, and long-range arena benchmarks showcase the efficiency and effectiveness of our proposed model.

    "abstract": "We present a novel framework to overcome the limitations of equivariant architectures in learning functions with group symmetries. In contrary to equivariant architectures, the framework uses an arbitrary backbone (such as an MLP or a transformer) and symmetrizes it to be equivariant to given group by employing a small equivariant network that parameterizes the probabilistic distribution underlying the symmetrization. The distribution is end-to-end trained with the backbone which can maximize performance while reducing sample complexity of symmetrization. We show that this approach ensures not only equivariance to the given group but also universal approximation ability in expectation. We implement our method on a simple patch-based transformer backbone initialized from pretrained vision transformer, and test it for a wide range of symmetry groups including permutation and Euclidean groups and their combinations. Empirical tests show competitive results against tailored equivariant architectures, suggesting the potential for learning equivariant functions for diverse groups using a non-equivariant universal backbone. We further show evidence of enhanced learning in symmetric modalities, like graphs, when pretrained from non-symmetric modalities, like vision",

We refer to such systems as mixed systems, which are widely used in various applications, including Manufacturing systems, communication networks, and queueing networks. We propose a sample-efficient RL method that accelerates learning by generating augmented data samples.

This method significantly improves learning by reducing the sample complexity such that the dataset only needs to have sufficient coverage of the stochastic states.

By doing so, our approach not only addresses performance concerns but also enhances interpretability, providing valuable insight into the model's decision-making process. Our technique can be applied to existing pre-trained models through a straightforward fine-tuning process, and the pruning strength can be specified by a sparsity parameter.

Kronecker-Factored Approximate Curvature (K-FAC), a second-order optimisation method, has shown promise to speed up neural network training and thereby reduce computational costs. However, there is currently no framework to apply it to generic architectures, specifically ones with linear weight-sharing layers. In this work, we identify two different settings of linear weight-sharing layers which motivate two flavours of K-FAC -- *expand* and *reduce*. We show that they are exact for deep linear networks with weight-sharing in their respective setting. Notably, K-FAC-reduce is generally faster than K-FAC-expand, which we leverage to speed up automatic hyperparameter selection via optimising the marginal likelihood for a Wide ResNet. Finally, we observe little difference between these two K-FAC variations when using them to train both a graph neural network and a vision transformer. However, both variations are able to reach a fixed validation metric target in $50$-$75$\\% of the number of steps of a first-order reference run, which translates into a comparable improvement in wall-clock time.

A well-known result in the field states that the empirical frequencies of play under no-regret learning converge to the game's set of coarse correlated equilibria; however, our understanding of how the players' _actual strategies_ evolve over time is much more limited – and, in many cases, non-existent. This issue is exacerbated further by a series of recent results showing that _only_ strict Nash equilibria are stable and attracting under regularized learning, thus making the relation between learning and _pointwise_ solution concepts particularly elusive. In lieu of this, we take a more general approach and instead seek to characterize the _setwise_ rationality properties of the players' day-to-day trajectory of play. To do so, we focus on one of the most stringent criteria of setwise strategic stability, namely that any unilateral deviation from the set in question incurs a cost to the deviator – a property known as _closedness under better replies_ (club). In so doing, we obtain a remarkable equivalence between strategic and dynamic stability: _a product of pure strategies is closed under better replies if and only if its span is stable and attracting under regularized learning._ In addition, we estimate the rate of convergence to such sets, and we show that methods based on entropic regularization (like the exponential weights algorithm) converge at a geometric rate, while projection-based methods converge within a finite number of iterations, even with bandit, payoff-based feedback",

Previous works have partially addressed these issues separately, but have not been able to address all of them simultaneously.

To address the challenge of capturing different types of semantic information, we propose a novel Water-wave Information Transmission (WIT) framework. This framework captures both long- and short-term repetitive patterns through bi-granular information transmission. It also models global and local correlations by recursively fusing and selecting information using Horizontal Vertical Gated Selective Unit (HVGSU).

    "abstract": "High-dimensional mediation analysis is often associated with a multiple testing problem for detecting significant mediators. Assessing the uncertainty of this detecting process via false discovery rate (FDR) has garnered great interest. To control the FDR in multiple testing, two essential steps are involved: ranking and selection. Existing approaches either construct p-values without calibration or disregard the joint information across tests, leading to conservation in FDR control or non-optimal ranking rules for multiple hypotheses. In this paper, we develop an adaptive mediation detection procedure (referred to as \"AMDP\") to identify relevant mediators while asymptotically controlling the FDR in high-dimensional mediation analysis. AMDP produces the optimal rule for ranking hypotheses and proposes a data-driven strategy to determine the threshold for mediator selection. This novel method captures information from the proportions of composite null hypotheses and the distribution of p-values, which turns the high dimensionality into an advantage instead of a limitation. The numerical studies on synthetic and real data sets illustrate the performances of AMDP compared with existing approaches",

    "volume": "spotlight",
    "abstract": "Interpreting time series models is uniquely challenging because it requires identifying both the location of time series signals that drive model predictions and their matching to an interpretable temporal pattern. While explainers from other modalities can be applied to time series, their inductive biases do not transfer well to the inherently challenging interpretation of time series. We present TimeX, a time series consistency model for training explainers. TimeX trains an interpretable surrogate to mimic the behavior of a pretrained time series model. It addresses the issue of model faithfulness by introducing model behavior consistency, a novel formulation that preserves relations in the latent space induced by the pretrained model with relations in the latent space induced by TimeX. TimeX provides discrete attribution maps and, unlike existing interpretability methods, it learns a latent space of explanations that can be used in various ways, such as to provide landmarks to visually aggregate similar explanations and easily recognize temporal patterns. We evaluate TimeX on eight synthetic and real-world datasets and compare its performance against state-of-the-art interpretability methods. We also conduct case studies using physiological time series. Quantitative evaluations demonstrate that TimeX achieves the highest or second-highest performance in every metric compared to baselines across all datasets. Through case studies, we show that the novel components of TimeX show potential for training faithful, interpretable models that capture the behavior of pretrained time series models",

We argue that instabilities in the optimization process are often caused by the nonmonotonicity of the loss landscape and show how linear interpolation can help by leveraging the theory of nonexpansive operators. We construct a new optimization scheme called relaxed approximate proximal point (RAPP), which is the first explicit method to achieve last iterate convergence rates for the full range of cohypomonotone problems. The construction extends to constrained and regularized settings. By replacing the inner optimizer in RAPP we rediscover the family of Lookahead algorithms for which we establish convergence in cohypomonotone problems even when the base optimizer is taken to be gradient descent ascent. The range of cohypomonotone problems in which Lookahead converges is further expanded by exploiting that Lookahead inherits the properties of the base optimizer. We corroborate the results with experiments on generative adversarial networks which demonstrates the benefits of the linear interpolation present in both RAPP and Lookahead",

Existing models for linker design assume that the relative positions of the fragments are known, which may not be the case in real scenarios. In this work, we address a more general problem where the poses of the fragments are *unknown* in 3D space. We develop a 3D equivariant diffusion model that jointly learns the generative process of both fragment poses and the 3D structure of the linker. By viewing fragments as rigid bodies, we design a fragment pose prediction module inspired by the Newton-Euler equations in rigid body mechanics.

Existing studies prove convergence of SAM for smooth functions, but they do so by assuming decaying perturbation size $\\rho$ and/or no gradient normalization in $y_t$, which is detached from practice. To address this gap, we study deterministic/stochastic versions of SAM with practical configurations (i.e., constant $\\rho$ and gradient normalization in $y_t$) and explore their convergence properties on smooth functions with (non)convexity assumptions. Perhaps surprisingly, in many scenarios, we find out that SAM has limited capability to converge to global minima or stationary points. For smooth strongly convex functions, we show that while deterministic SAM enjoys tight global convergence rates of $\\tilde \\Theta(\\frac{1}{T^2})$, the convergence bound of stochastic SAM suffers an inevitable additive term $\\mathcal O(\\rho^2)$, indicating convergence only up to neighborhoods of optima. In fact, such $\\mathcal O(\\rho^2)$ factors arise for stochastic SAM in all the settings we consider, and also for deterministic SAM in nonconvex cases; importantly, we prove by examples that such terms are unavoidable. Our results highlight vastly different characteristics of SAM with vs. without decaying perturbation size or gradient normalization, and suggest that the intuitions gained from one version may not apply to the other",

This setting has implications in scenarios where data can solely be sampled from a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) type algorithm, and the objective is to perform inference on parameters of the stationary distribution. Most convergence guarantees for Oja's algorithm in the literature assume that the data-points are sampled IID.

Despite the key principle that maximizing the similarity between positive node pairs while minimizing it between negative node pairs is well established, some fundamental problems are still unclear. Considering the complex graph structure, are some nodes consistently well-trained and following this principle even with different graph augmentations? Or are there some nodes more likely to be untrained across graph augmentations and violate the principle? How to distinguish these nodes and further guide the training of GCL? To answer these questions, we first present experimental evidence showing that the training of GCL is indeed imbalanced across all nodes. To address this problem, we propose the metric \"node compactness\", which is the lower bound of how a node follows the GCL principle related to the range of augmentations. We further derive the form of node compactness theoretically through bound propagation, which can be integrated into binary cross-entropy as a regularization. To this end, we propose the PrOvable Training (POT) for GCL, which regularizes the training of GCL to encode node embeddings that follows the GCL principle better. Through extensive experiments on various benchmarks, POT consistently improves the existing GCL approaches, serving as a friendly plugin",

However, symmetries provide fixed hard constraints on the functions a network can represent, need to be specified in advance, and can not be adapted.

Learning symmetry and associated weight connectivity structures from scratch is difficult for two reasons. First, it requires efficient and flexible parameterisations of layer-wise equivariances. Secondly, symmetries act as constraints and are therefore not encouraged by training losses measuring data fit. To overcome these challenges, we improve parameterisations of soft equivariance and learn the amount of equivariance in layers by optimising the marginal likelihood, estimated using differentiable Laplace approximations. The objective balances data fit and model complexity enabling layer-wise symmetry discovery in deep networks.

    "abstract": "Recent research has developed several Monte Carlo methods for estimating the normalization constant (partition function) based on the idea of annealing. This means sampling successively from a path of distributions which interpolate between a tractable \"proposal\" distribution and the unnormalized \"target\" distribution. Prominent estimators in this family include annealed importance sampling and annealed noise-contrastive estimation (NCE). Such methods hinge on a number of design choices: which estimator to use, which path of distributions to use and whether to use a path at all; so far, there is no definitive theory on which choices are efficient. Here, we evaluate each design choice by the asymptotic estimation error it produces. First, we show that using NCE is more efficient than the importance sampling estimator, but in the limit of infinitesimal path steps, the difference vanishes. Second, we find that using the geometric path brings down the estimation error from an exponential to a polynomial function of the parameter distance between the target and proposal distributions. Third, we find that the arithmetic path, while rarely used, can offer optimality properties over the universally-used geometric path. In fact, in a particular limit, the optimal path is arithmetic. Based on this theory, we finally propose a two-step estimator to approximate the optimal path in an efficient way",

However, recent empirical studies have shown that the existing methods of estimating IF predict the leave-one-out-and-retrain effect poorly. In order to understand the mismatch between the theoretical promise and the practical results, we analyse five assumptions made by IF methods which are problematic for modern-scale deep neural networks and which concern convexity, numeric stability, training trajectory and parameter divergence. This allows us to clarify what can be expected theoretically from IF. We show that while most assumptions can be addressed successfully, the parameter divergence poses a clear limitation on the predictive power of IF: influence fades over training time even with deterministic training. We illustrate this theoretical result with BERT and ResNet models. Another conclusion from the theoretical analysis is that IF are still useful for model debugging and correcting even though some of the assumptions made in prior work do not hold: using natural language processing and computer vision tasks, we verify that mis-predictions can be successfully corrected by taking only a few fine-tuning steps on influential examples",

However, differential privacy's worst-case nature entails scaling such noise to the range of the queries even for highly-concentrated queries, or introducing more complex algorithms. In this paper, we prove that straightforward noise-addition algorithms already provide variance-dependent guarantees that also extend to unbounded queries. This improvement stems from a novel characterization that illuminates the core problem of adaptive data analysis. We show that the harm of adaptivity results from the covariance between the new query and a Bayes factor-based measure of how much information about the data sample was encoded in the responses given to past queries.

Building upon Hindsight Credit Assignment (HCA), we introduce Counterfactual Contribution Analysis (COCOA), a new family of model-based credit assignment algorithms. Our algorithms achieve precise credit assignment by measuring the contribution of actions upon obtaining subsequent rewards, by quantifying a counterfactual query: ‘Would the agent still have reached this reward if it had taken another action?'. We show that measuring contributions w.r.t. rewarding _states_, as is done in HCA, results in spurious estimates of contributions, causing HCA to degrade towards the high-variance REINFORCE estimator in many relevant environments. Instead, we measure contributions w.r.t. rewards or learned representations of the rewarding objects, resulting in gradient estimates with lower variance. We run experiments on a suite of problems specifically designed to evaluate long-term credit assignment capabilities. By using dynamic programming, we measure ground-truth policy gradients and show that the improved performance of our new model-based credit assignment methods is due to lower bias and variance compared to HCA and common baselines.

In the offline setting wherethe agent is required to learn to imitate without interaction with the environment, behavior cloning (BC) has been shown to be a simple yet effective method for imitation learning. However, when the information about the actions executed in the past timesteps leaks into the observation histories, ILOH via BC often ends up imitating its own past actions. In this paper, we address this catastrophic failure by proposing a principled regularization for BC, which we name Past Action Leakage Regularization (PALR). The main idea behind our approach is to leverage the classical notion of conditional independence to mitigate the leakage. We compare different instances of our framework with natural choices of conditional independence metric and its estimator. The result of our comparison advocates the use of a particular kernel-based estimator for the conditional independence metric. We conduct an extensive set of experiments on benchmark datasets in order to assess the effectiveness of our regularization method.

However, computing PIDs is computationally challenging in practice, and statistical issues such as the bias and variance of estimates remain largely unexplored. In this paper, we propose a new method for efficiently computing and estimating a PID definition on multivariate Gaussian distributions. We show empirically that our method satisfies an intuitive additivity property, and recovers the ground truth in a battery of canonical examples, even at high dimensionality. We also propose and evaluate, for the first time, a method to correct the bias in PID estimates at finite sample sizes. Finally, we demonstrate that our Gaussian PID effectively characterizes inter-areal interactions in the mouse brain, revealing higher redundancy between visual areas when a stimulus is behaviorally relevant",

    "volume": "spotlight",
    "abstract": "We investigate replicable learning algorithms. Informally a learning algorithm is replicable if the algorithm outputs the same canonical hypothesis over multiple runs with high probability, even when different runs observe a different set of samples from the unknown data distribution. In general, such a strong notion of replicability is not achievable. Thus we consider two feasible notions of replicability called {\\em list replicability} and {\\em certificate replicability}. Intuitively, these notions capture the degree of (non) replicability. The goal is to design learning algorithms with optimal list and certificate complexities while minimizing the sample complexity. Our contributions are the following. 1. We first study the learning task of estimating the biases of $d$ coins, up to an additive error of $\\varepsilon$, by observing samples. For this task, we design a $(d+1)$-list replicable algorithm. To complement this result, we establish that the list complexity is optimal, i.e there are no learning algorithms with a list size smaller than $d+1$ for this task. We also design learning algorithms with certificate complexity $\\tilde{O}(\\log d)$. The sample complexity of both these algorithms is $\\tilde{O}(\\frac{d^2}{\\varepsilon^2})$ where $\\varepsilon$ is the approximation error parameter (for a constant error probability). 2. In the PAC model, we show that any hypothesis class that is learnable with $d$-nonadaptive statistical queries can be learned via a $(d+1)$-list replicable algorithm and also via a $\\tilde{O}(\\log d)$-certificate replicable algorithm. The sample complexity of both these algorithms is $\\tilde{O}(\\frac{d^2}{\\nu^2})$ where $\\nu$ is the approximation error of the statistical query. We also show that for the concept class \\dtep, the list complexity is exactly $d+1$ with respect to the uniform distribution. To establish our upper bound results we use rounding schemes induced by geometric partitions with certain properties. We use Sperner/KKM Lemma to establish the lower bound results",

    "abstract": "Self-supervised learning (SSL) as an effective paradigm of representation learning has achieved tremendous success on various curated datasets in diverse scenarios. Nevertheless, when facing the long-tailed distribution in real-world applications, it is still hard for existing methods to capture transferable and robust representation. The attribution is that the vanilla SSL methods that pursue the sample-level uniformity easily leads to representation learning disparity, where head classes with the huge sample number dominate the feature regime but tail classes with the small sample number passively collapse. To address this problem, we propose a novel Geometric Harmonization (GH) method to encourage the category-level uniformity in representation learning, which is more benign to the minority and almost does not hurt the majority under long-tailed distribution. Specially, GH measures the population statistics of the embedding space on top of self-supervised learning, and then infer an fine-grained instance-wise calibration to constrain the space expansion of head classes and avoid the passive collapse of tail classes. Our proposal does not alter the setting of SSL and can be easily integrated into existing methods in a low-cost manner.

    "abstract": "Visual model-based RL methods typically encode image observations into low-dimensional representations in a manner that does not eliminate redundant information. This leaves them susceptible to spurious variations -- changes in task-irrelevant components such as background distractors or lighting conditions. In this paper, we propose a visual model-based RL method that learns a latent representation resilient to such spurious variations. Our training objective encourages the representation to be maximally predictive of dynamics and reward, while constraining the information flow from the observation to the latent representation. We demonstrate that this objective significantly bolsters the resilience of visual model-based RL methods to visual distractors, allowing them to operate in dynamic environments. We then show that while the learned encoder is able to operate in dynamic environments, it is not invariant under significant distribution shift. To address this, we propose a simple reward-free alignment procedure that enables test time adaptation of the encoder. This allows for quick adaptation to widely differing environments without having to relearn the dynamics and policy. Our effort is a step towards making model-based RL a practical and useful tool for dynamic, diverse domains and we show its effectiveness in simulation tasks with significant spurious variations",

Adapting the economic theory of contract design to this setting, we define budget-optimal contracts and prove they take a simple threshold form under reasonable assumptions.

    "volume": "spotlight",
    "abstract": "Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are popular machine learning tools for modeling and forecasting sequential data and for inferring dynamical systems (DS) from observed time series. Concepts from DS theory (DST) have variously been used to further our understanding of both, how trained RNNs solve complex tasks, and the training process itself. Bifurcations are particularly important phenomena in DS, including RNNs, that refer to topological (qualitative) changes in a system's dynamical behavior as one or more of its parameters are varied. Knowing the bifurcation structure of an RNN will thus allow to deduce many of its computational and dynamical properties, like its sensitivity to parameter variations or its behavior during training. In particular, bifurcations may account for sudden loss jumps observed in RNN training that could severely impede the training process. Here we first mathematically prove for a particular class of ReLU-based RNNs that certain bifurcations are indeed associated with loss gradients tending toward infinity or zero. We then introduce a novel heuristic algorithm for detecting all fixed points and $k$-cycles in ReLU-based RNNs and their existence and stability regions, hence bifurcation manifolds in parameter space. In contrast to previous numerical algorithms for finding fixed points and common continuation methods, our algorithm provides $\\textit{exact}$ results and returns fixed points and cycles up to high orders with surprisingly good scaling behavior. We exemplify the algorithm on the analysis of the training process of RNNs, and find that the recently introduced technique of generalized teacher forcing completely avoids certain types of bifurcations in training. Thus, besides facilitating the DST analysis of trained RNNs, our algorithm provides a powerful instrument for analyzing the training process itself",

Although PINNs have pioneered a proper integration of deep-learning and scientific computing, they require repetitive time-consuming training of neural networks, which is not suitable for many-query scenarios. To address this issue, we propose a lightweight low-rank PINNs containing only hundreds of model parameters and an associated hypernetwork-based meta-learning algorithm, which allows efficient approximation of solutions of PDEs for varying ranges of PDE input parameters. Moreover, we show that the proposed method is effective in overcoming a challenging issue, known as \"failure modes\" of PINNs",

Yet the mechanisms that underlie it are poorly understood. In this paper, we demonstrate that comparable ICL capabilities can be acquired by an alternative sequence prediction learning method using clone-structured causal graphs (CSCGs). Moreover, a key property of CSCGs is that, unlike transformer-based LLMs, they are {\\em interpretable}, which considerably simplifies the task of explaining how ICL works. Specifically, we show that it uses a combination of (a) learning template (schema) circuits for pattern completion, (b) retrieving relevant templates in a context-sensitive manner, and (c) rebinding of novel tokens to appropriate slots in the templates. We go on to marshall evidence for the hypothesis that similar mechanisms underlie ICL in LLMs. For example, we find that, with CSCGs as with LLMs, different capabilities emerge at different levels of overparameterization, suggesting that overparameterization helps in learning more complex template (schema) circuits. By showing how ICL can be achieved with small models and datasets, we open up a path to novel architectures, and take a vital step towards a more general understanding of the mechanics behind this important capability",

Existing research explores the application of representation learning for data-efficient RL, e.g., learning predictive representations by predicting long-term future states. However, many existing methods do not fully exploit the structural information inherent in sequential state signals, which can potentially improve the quality of long-term decision-making but is difficult to discern in the time domain. To tackle this problem, we propose State Sequences Prediction via Fourier Transform (SPF), a novel method that exploits the frequency domain of state sequences to extract the underlying patterns in time series data for learning expressive representations efficiently. Specifically, we theoretically analyze the existence of structural information in state sequences, which is closely related to policy performance and signal regularity, and then propose to predict the Fourier transform of infinite-step future state sequences to extract such information. One of the appealing features of SPF is that it is simple to implement while not requiring storage of infinite-step future states as prediction targets. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms several state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of both sample efficiency and performance",

A key challenge in designing effective assignment policies is evaluating how changes to the assignment algorithm map to changes in review quality. In this work, we leverage recently proposed policies that introduce randomness in peer-review assignment—in order to mitigate fraud—as a valuable opportunity to evaluate counterfactual assignment policies. Specifically, we exploit how such randomized assignments provide a positive probability of observing the reviews of many assignment policies of interest. To address challenges in applying standard off-policy evaluation methods, such as violations of positivity, we introduce novel methods for partial identification based on monotonicity and Lipschitz smoothness assumptions for the mapping between reviewer-paper covariates and outcomes. We apply our methods to peer-review data from two computer science venues: the TPDP'21 workshop (95 papers and 35 reviewers) and the AAAI'22 conference (8,450 papers and 3,145 reviewers). We consider estimates of (i) the effect on review quality when changing weights in the assignment algorithm, e.g., weighting reviewers' bids vs. textual similarity (between the review's past papers and the submission), and (ii) the \"cost of randomization\", capturing the difference in expected quality between the perturbed and unperturbed optimal match. We find that placing higher weight on text similarity results in higher review quality and that introducing randomization in the reviewer-paper assignment only marginally reduces the review quality. Our methods for partial identification may be of independent interest, while our off-policy approach can likely find use in evaluating a broad class of algorithmic matching systems",

The properties we explore include the label space, label semantics, image diversity, data domains, and data quantity of the pre-training distribution. We find that the primary factor influencing downstream effective robustness (Taori et al., 2020) is data quantity, while other factors have limited significance. For example, reducing the number of ImageNet pre-training classes by 4x while increasing the number of images per class by 4x (that is, keeping total data quantity fixed) does not impact the robustness of fine-tuned models.

This phenomenon motivated a large body of work on \"benign overfitting\", where interpolating predictors achieve near-optimal performance. Recently, it was conjectured and empirically observed that the behavior of NNs is often better described as \"tempered overfitting\", where the performance is non-optimal yet also non-trivial, and degrades as a function of the noise level. However, a theoretical justification of this claim for non-linear NNs has been lacking so far. In this work, we provide several results that aim at bridging these complementing views. We study a simple classification setting with 2-layer ReLU NNs, and prove that under various assumptions, the type of overfitting transitions from tempered in the extreme case of one-dimensional data, to benign in high dimensions. Thus, we show that the input dimension has a crucial role on the overfitting profile in this setting, which we also validate empirically for intermediate dimensions.

Using this approach, one can encode rich domain knowledge into the network in the form of mathematical formulas.

Notably, the solver need not be differentiable. We implement SMTLayer as a Pytorch module, and our empirical results show that it leads to models that 1) require fewer training samples than conventional models, 2) that are robust to certain types of covariate shift, and 3) that ultimately learn representations that are consistent with symbolic knowledge, and thus naturally interpretable",

    "abstract": "Unsupervised pre-training has recently become the bedrock for computer vision and natural language processing. In reinforcement learning (RL), goal-conditioned RL can potentially provide an analogous self-supervised approach for making use of large quantities of unlabeled (reward-free) data. However, building effective algorithms for goal-conditioned RL that can learn directly from diverse offline data is challenging, because it is hard to accurately estimate the exact value function for faraway goals. Nonetheless, goal-reaching problems exhibit structure, such that reaching distant goals entails first passing through closer subgoals. This structure can be very useful, as assessing the quality of actions for nearby goals is typically easier than for more distant goals. Based on this idea, we propose a hierarchical algorithm for goal-conditioned RL from offline data. Using one action-free value function, we learn two policies that allow us to exploit this structure: a high-level policy that treats states as actions and predicts (a latent representation of) a subgoal and a low-level policy that predicts the action for reaching this subgoal. Through analysis and didactic examples, we show how this hierarchical decomposition makes our method robust to noise in the estimated value function. We then apply our method to offline goal-reaching benchmarks, showing that our method can solve long-horizon tasks that stymie prior methods, can scale to high-dimensional image observations, and can readily make use of action-free data.

Prior works in this setting follow the same recipe of using concentration inequalities and an inductive argument with union bound to bound the iterates across all iterations. This method results in an increase in the failure probability by a factor of $T$, where $T$ is the number of iterations. We instead propose a new analysis approach based on bounding the moment generating function of a well chosen supermartingale sequence. We improve the dependency on $T$ in the convergence guarantee for a wide range of algorithms with clipped gradients, including stochastic (accelerated) mirror descent for convex objectives and stochastic gradient descent for nonconvex objectives. Our high probability bounds achieve the optimal convergence rates and match the best currently known in-expectation bounds. Our approach naturally allows the algorithms to use time-varying step sizes and clipping parameters when the time horizon is unknown, which appears difficult or even impossible using the techniques from prior works.

However, despite the high expressiveness of diffusion models in image generation, their integration into object-centric learning remains largely unexplored in this domain. In this paper, we explore the feasibility and potential of integrating diffusion models into object-centric learning and investigate the pros and cons of this approach. We introduce Latent Slot Diffusion (LSD), a novel model that serves dual purposes: it is the first object-centric learning model to replace conventional slot decoders with a latent diffusion model conditioned on object slots, and it is also the first unsupervised compositional conditional diffusion model that operates without the need for supervised annotations like text. Through experiments on various object-centric tasks, including the first application of the FFHQ dataset in this field, we demonstrate that LSD significantly outperforms state-of-the-art transformer-based decoders, particularly in more complex scenes, and exhibits superior unsupervised compositional generation quality. In addition, we conduct a preliminary investigation into the integration of pre-trained diffusion models in LSD and demonstrate its effectiveness in real-world image segmentation and generation.

    "abstract": "Infants possess a remarkable ability to rapidly learn and process visual inputs. As an infant's mobility increases, so does the variety and dynamics of their visual inputs. Is this change in the properties of the visual inputs beneficial or even critical for the proper development of the visual system? To address this question, we used video recordings from infants wearing head-mounted cameras to train a variety of self-supervised learning models. Critically, we separated the infant data by age group and evaluated the importance of training with a curriculum aligned with developmental order. We found that initiating learning with the data from the youngest age group provided the strongest learning signal and led to the best learning outcomes in terms of downstream task performance. We then showed that the benefits of the data from the youngest age group are due to the slowness and simplicity of the visual experience. The results provide strong empirical evidence for the importance of the properties of the early infant experience and developmental progression in training. More broadly, our approach and findings take a noteworthy step towards reverse engineering the learning mechanisms in newborn brains using image-computable models from artificial intelligence",

We aim to evaluate (1) the effectiveness of LLMs in generating plans autonomously in commonsense planning tasks and (2) the potential of LLMs as a source of heuristic guidance for other agents (AI planners) in their planning tasks. We conduct a systematic study by generating a suite of instances on domains similar to the ones employed in the International Planning Competition and evaluate LLMs in two distinct modes: autonomous and heuristic. Our findings reveal that LLMs' ability to generate executable plans autonomously is rather limited, with the best model (GPT-4) having an average success rate of ~12% across the domains. However, the results in the heuristic mode show more promise. In the heuristic mode, we demonstrate that LLM-generated plans can improve the search process for underlying sound planners and additionally show that external verifiers can help provide feedback on the generated plans and back-prompt the LLM for better plan generation",

    "abstract": "Intracortical brain-computer interfaces (iBCIs) have shown promise for restoring rapid communication to people with neurological disorders such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). However, to maintain high performance over time, iBCIs typically need frequent recalibration to combat changes in the neural recordings that accrue over days. This requires iBCI users to stop using the iBCI and engage in supervised data collection, making the iBCI system hard to use. In this paper, we propose a method that enables self-recalibration of communication iBCIs without interrupting the user. Our method leverages large language models (LMs) to automatically correct errors in iBCI outputs. The self-recalibration process uses these corrected outputs (\"pseudo-labels\") to continually update the iBCI decoder online. Over a period of more than one year (403 days), we evaluated our Continual Online Recalibration with Pseudo-labels (CORP) framework with one clinical trial participant. CORP achieved a stable decoding accuracy of 93.84% in an online handwriting iBCI task, significantly outperforming other baseline methods. Notably, this is the longest-running iBCI stability demonstration involving a human participant. Our results provide the first evidence for long-term stabilization of a plug-and-play, high-performance communication iBCI, addressing a major barrier for the clinical translation of iBCIs",

This work focuses on detecting and correcting failed state estimations before adopting them in SAE inverse problems, by utilizing simulations and performance metrics guided by physical laws. We suggest to flag a machine learning estimation when its physical model error exceeds a feasible threshold, and propose a novel approach, GEESE, to correct it through optimization, aiming at delivering both low error and high efficiency. The key designs of GEESE include (1) a hybrid surrogate error model to provide fast error estimations to reduce simulation cost and to enable gradient based backpropagation of error feedback, and (2) two generative models to approximate the probability distributions of the candidate states for simulating the exploitation and exploration behaviours. All three models are constructed as neural networks. GEESE is tested on three real-world SAE inverse problems and compared to a number of state-of-the-art optimization/search approaches. Results show that it fails the least number of times in terms of finding a feasible state correction, and requires physical evaluations less frequently in general",

    "abstract": "We introduce a two-stage probabilistic framework for statistical downscaling using unpaired data. Statistical downscaling seeks a probabilistic map to transform low-resolution data from a biased coarse-grained numerical scheme to high-resolution data that is consistent with a high-fidelity scheme. Our framework tackles the problem by composing two transformations: (i) a debiasing step via an optimal transport map, and (ii) an upsampling step achieved by a probabilistic diffusion model with a posteriori conditional sampling. This approach characterizes a conditional distribution without needing paired data, and faithfully recovers relevant physical statistics from biased samples. We demonstrate the utility of the proposed approach on one- and two-dimensional fluid flow problems, which are representative of the core difficulties present in numerical simulations of weather and climate. Our method produces realistic high-resolution outputs from low-resolution inputs, by upsampling resolutions of $8\\times$ and $16\\times$. Moreover, our procedure correctly matches the statistics of physical quantities, even when the low-frequency content of the inputs and outputs do not match, a crucial but difficult-to-satisfy assumption needed by current state-of-the-art alternatives.

    "abstract": "We study benign overfitting in two-layer ReLU networks trained using gradient descent and hinge loss on noisy data for binary classification. In particular, we consider linearly separable data for which a relatively small proportion of labels are corrupted or flipped. We identify conditions on the margin of the clean data that give rise to three distinct training outcomes: benign overfitting, in which zero loss is achieved and with high probability test data is classified correctly; overfitting, in which zero loss is achieved but test data is misclassified with probability lower bounded by a constant; and non-overfitting, in which clean points, but not corrupt points, achieve zero loss and again with high probability test data is classified correctly. Our analysis provides a fine-grained description of the dynamics of neurons throughout training and reveals two distinct phases: in the first phase clean points achieve close to zero loss, in the second phase clean points oscillate on the boundary of zero loss while corrupt points either converge towards zero loss or are eventually zeroed by the network. We prove these results using a combinatorial approach that involves bounding the number of clean versus corrupt updates during these phases of training",

This removes the need for concentration results in random matrix theory or their generalizations to random operators. The main results established in this paper include strong consistency of vector-valued RF estimators under model misspecification and minimax optimal convergence rates in the well-specified setting.

    "abstract": "Learning from label proportions (LLP) is a generalization of supervised learning in which the training data is available as sets or bags of feature-vectors (instances) along with the average instance-label of each bag. The goal is to train a good instance classifier. While most previous works on LLP have focused on training models on such training data, computational learnability of LLP was only recently explored by Saket (2021, 2022) who showed worst case intractability of properly learning linear threshold functions (LTFs) from label proportions. However, their work did not rule out efficient algorithms for this problem for natural distributions. In this work we show that it is indeed possible to efficiently learn LTFs using LTFs when given access to random bags of some label proportion in which feature-vectors are, conditioned on their labels, independently sampled from a Gaussian distribution $N(µ, Σ)$. Our work shows that a certain matrix – formed using covariances of the differences of feature-vectors sampled from the bags with and without replacement – necessarily has its principal component, after a transformation, in the direction of the normal vector of the LTF. Our algorithm estimates the means and covariance matrices using subgaussian concentration bounds which we show can be applied to efficiently sample bags for approximating the normal direction. Using this in conjunction with novel generalization error bounds in the bag setting, we show that a low error hypothesis LTF can be identified. For some special cases of the $N(0, I)$ distribution we provide a simpler mean estimation based algorithm. We include an experimental evaluation of our learning algorithms along with a comparison with those of Saket (2021, 2022) and random LTFs, demonstrating the effectiveness of our techniques",

While LLMs have advanced the state-of-the-art on these tasks with structure implications, whether LLMs could explicitly process textual descriptions of graphs and structures, map them to grounded conceptual spaces, and perform structured operations remains underexplored. To this end, we propose NLGraph (Natural Language Graph), a comprehensive benchmark of graph-based problem solving designed in natural language. NLGraph contains 29,370 problems, covering eight graph reasoning tasks with varying complexity from simple tasks such as connectivity and shortest path up to complex problems such as maximum flow and simulating graph neural networks. We evaluate LLMs (GPT-3/4) with various prompting approaches on the NLGraph benchmark and find that 1) language models do demonstrate preliminary graph reasoning abilities, 2) the benefit of advanced prompting and in-context learning diminishes on more complex graph problems, while 3) LLMs are also (un)surprisingly brittle in the face of spurious correlations in graph and problem settings. We then propose Build-a-Graph Prompting and Algorithmic Prompting, two instruction-based approaches to enhance LLMs in solving natural language graph problems. Build-a-Graph and Algorithmic prompting improve the performance of LLMs on NLGraph by 3.07% to 16.85% across multiple tasks and settings, while how to solve the most complicated graph reasoning tasks in our setup with language models remains an open research question",

In this work, we study the problem of Adaptive Neyman Allocation in a design-based potential outcomes framework, where the experimenter seeks to construct an adaptive design which is nearly as efficient as the optimal (but infeasible) non-adaptive Neyman design, which has access to all potential outcomes.

    "abstract": "Large transformer models trained on diverse datasets have shown a remarkable ability to learn in-context, achieving high few-shot performance on tasks they were not explicitly trained to solve. In this paper, we study the in-context learning capabilities of transformers in decision-making problems, i.e., reinforcement learning (RL) for bandits and Markov decision processes. To do so, we introduce and study the Decision-Pretrained Transformer (DPT), a supervised pretraining method where a transformer predicts an optimal action given a query state and an in-context dataset of interactions from a diverse set of tasks. While simple, this procedure produces a model with several surprising capabilities. We find that the trained transformer can solve a range of RL problems in-context, exhibiting both exploration online and conservatism offline, despite not being explicitly trained to do so. The model also generalizes beyond the pretraining distribution to new tasks and automatically adapts its decision-making strategies to unknown structure. Theoretically, we show DPT can be viewed as an efficient implementation of Bayesian posterior sampling, a provably sample-efficient RL algorithm. We further leverage this connection to provide guarantees on the regret of the in-context algorithm yielded by DPT, and prove that it can learn faster than algorithms used to generate the pretraining data.

In an attempt to demystify transformer LLMs, we investigate the limits of these models across three representative compositional tasks---multi-digit multiplication, logic grid puzzles, and a classic dynamic programming problem. These tasks require breaking problems down into sub-steps and synthesizing these steps into a precise answer. We formulate compositional tasks as computation graphs to systematically quantify the level of complexity, and break down reasoning steps into intermediate sub-procedures. Our empirical findings suggest that transformer LLMs solve compositional tasks by reducing multi-step compositional reasoning into linearized subgraph matching, without necessarily developing systematic problem-solving skills. To round off our empirical study, we provide theoretical arguments on abstract multi-step reasoning problems that highlight how autoregressive generations' performance can rapidly decay with increased task complexity",

We establish that, contrary to popular belief, the graph attention mechanism cannot prevent oversmoothing and loses expressive power exponentially. The proposed framework extends the existing results on oversmoothing for symmetric GCNs to a significantly broader class of GNN models, including random walk GCNs, Graph Attention Networks (GATs) and (graph) transformers.

A fundamental goal is to design computationally efficient policies that achieve a diminishing optimality gap as the number of arms, $N$, grows large. Existing results on asymptotic optimality all rely on the uniform global attractor property (UGAP), a complex and challenging-to-verify assumption. In this paper, we propose a general, simulation-based framework, Follow-the-Virtual-Advice, that converts any single-armed policy into a policy for the original $N$-armed problem. This is done by simulating the single-armed policy on each arm and carefully steering the real state towards the simulated state. Our framework can be instantiated to produce a policy with an $O(1/\\sqrt{N})$ optimality gap. In the discrete-time setting, our result holds under a simpler synchronization assumption, which covers some problem instances that violate UGAP.

AP maximization for deep learning has widespread applications, particularly when there is a significant imbalance between positive and negative examples. Although numerous studies have been conducted on adversarial training, they primarily focus on robustness concerning accuracy, ensuring that the average accuracy on adversarially perturbed examples is well maintained. However, this type of adversarial robustness is insufficient for many applications, as minor perturbations on a single example can significantly impact AP while not greatly influencing the accuracy of the prediction system. To tackle this issue, we introduce a novel formulation that combines an AP surrogate loss with a regularization term representing adversarial ranking robustness, which maintains the consistency between ranking of clean data and that of perturbed data. We then devise an efficient stochastic optimization algorithm to optimize the resulting objective. Our empirical studies, which compare our method to current leading adversarial training baselines and other robust AP maximization strategies, demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. Notably, our methods outperform a state-of-the-art method (TRADES) by more than 4\\% in terms of robust AP against PGD attacks while achieving 7\\% higher AP on clean data simultaneously on CIFAR10 and CIFAR100",

Due to the quadratic scaling of attention, previous Transformer-based genomic models have used 512 to 4k tokens as context (<0.001% of the human genome), significantly limiting the modeling of long-range interactions in DNA. In addition, these methods rely on tokenizers or fixed k-mers to aggregate meaningful DNA units, losing single nucleotide resolution (i.e. DNA \"characters\") where subtle genetic variations can completely alter protein function via single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Recently, Hyena, a large language model based on implicit convolutions was shown to match attention in quality while allowing longer context lengths and lower time complexity. Leveraging Hyena's new long-range capabilities, we present HyenaDNA, a genomic foundation model pretrained on the human reference genome with context lengths of up to 1 million tokens at the single nucleotide-level – an up to 500x increase over previous dense attention-based models. HyenaDNA scales sub-quadratically in sequence length (training up to 160x faster than Transformer), uses single nucleotide tokens, and has full global context at each layer. We explore what longer context enables - including the first use of in-context learning in genomics for simple adaptation to novel tasks without updating pretrained model weights. On fine-tuned benchmarks from the Nucleotide Transformer, HyenaDNA reaches state-of-the-art (SotA) on 12 of 18 datasets using a model with orders of magnitude less parameters and pretraining data.1 On the GenomicBenchmarks, HyenaDNA surpasses SotA on 7 of 8 datasets on average by +10 accuracy points.

    "volume": "spotlight",
    "abstract": "Accurate prediction of dynamical systems in unstructured meshes has recently shown successes in scientific simulations. Many dynamical systems have a nonnegligible level of stochasticity introduced by various factors (e.g. chaoticity), so there is a need for a unified framework that captures both deterministic and stochastic components in the rollouts of these systems. Inspired by regeneration learning, we propose a new model that combines generative and sequential networks to model dynamical systems. Specifically, we use an autoencoder to learn compact representations of full-space physical variables in a low-dimensional space. We then integrate a transformer with a conditional normalizing flow model to model the temporal sequence of latent representations. We evaluate the new model in both deterministic and stochastic systems. The model outperforms several competitive baseline models and makes more accurate predictions of deterministic systems. Its own prediction error is also reflected in its uncertainty estimations. When predicting stochastic systems, the proposed model generates high-quality rollout samples. The mean and variance of these samples well match the statistics of samples computed from expensive numerical simulations",

We introduce the **Action Dynamics Benchmark (ActionBench)** containing two carefully designed probing tasks: Action Antonym and Video Reversal, which targets multimodal alignment capabilities and temporal understanding skills of the model, respectively. Despite recent video-language models' (VidLM) impressive performance on various benchmark tasks, our diagnostic tasks reveal their surprising deficiency (near-random performance) in action knowledge, suggesting that current models rely on object recognition abilities as a shortcut for action understanding. To remedy this, we propose a novel framework, **Paxion**, along with a new **Discriminative Video Dynamics Modeling (DVDM)** objective. The Paxion framework utilizes a **Knowledge Patcher** network to encode new action knowledge and a **Knowledge Fuser** component to integrate the Patcher into frozen VidLMs without compromising their existing capabilities. Due to limitations of the widely-used Video-Text Contrastive (VTC) loss for learning action knowledge, we introduce the DVDM objective to train the Knowledge Patcher. DVDM forces the model to encode the correlation between the action text and the correct ordering of video frames. Our extensive analyses show that Paxion and DVDM together effectively fill the gap in action knowledge understanding (~50% → 80%), while maintaining or improving performance on a wide spectrum of both object- and action-centric downstream tasks",

    "title": "When Does Optimizing a Proper Loss Yield Calibration?",
    "volume": "spotlight",
    "abstract": "Optimizing proper loss functions is popularly believed to yield predictors with good calibration properties; the intuition being that for such losses, the global optimum is to predict the ground-truth probabilities, which is indeed calibrated. However, typical machine learning models are trained to approximately minimize loss over restricted families of predictors, that are unlikely to contain the ground truth. Under what circumstances does optimizing proper loss over a restricted family yield calibrated models? What precise calibration guarantees does it give? In this work, we provide a rigorous answer to these questions. We replace the global optimality with a local optimality condition stipulating that the (proper) loss of the predictor cannot be reduced much by post-processing its predictions with a certain family of Lipschitz functions. We show that any predictor with this local optimality satisfies smooth calibration as defined in [Kakade and Foster, 2008, Błasiok et al., 2023]. Local optimality is plausibly satisfied by well-trained DNNs, which suggests an explanation for why they are calibrated from proper loss minimization alone. Finally, we show that the connection between local optimality and calibration error goes both ways: nearly calibrated predictors are also nearly locally optimal",

    "title": "Behavior Alignment via Reward Function Optimization",
    "volume": "spotlight",
    "abstract": "Designing reward functions for efficiently guiding reinforcement learning (RL) agents toward specific behaviors is a complex task. This is challenging since it requires the identification of reward structures that are not sparse and that avoid inadvertently inducing undesirable behaviors. Naively modifying the reward structure to offer denser and more frequent feedback can lead to unintended outcomes and promote behaviors that are not aligned with the designer's intended goal. Although potential-based reward shaping is often suggested as a remedy, we systematically investigate settings where deploying it often significantly impairs performance. To address these issues, we introduce a new framework that uses a bi-level objective to learn \\emph{behavior alignment reward functions}. These functions integrate auxiliary rewards reflecting a designer's heuristics and domain knowledge with the environment's primary rewards. Our approach automatically determines the most effective way to blend these types of feedback, thereby enhancing robustness against heuristic reward misspecification. Remarkably, it can also adapt an agent's policy optimization process to mitigate suboptimalities resulting from limitations and biases inherent in the underlying RL algorithms. We evaluate our method's efficacy on a diverse set of tasks, from small-scale experiments to high-dimensional control challenges. We investigate heuristic auxiliary rewards of varying quality---some of which are beneficial and others detrimental to the learning process. Our results show that our framework offers a robust and principled way to integrate designer-specified heuristics. It not only addresses key shortcomings of existing approaches but also consistently leads to high-performing solutions, even when given misaligned or poorly-specified auxiliary reward functions",

    "volume": "spotlight",
    "abstract": "Feature transformation aims to generate new pattern-discriminative feature space from original features to improve downstream machine learning (ML) task performances. However, the discrete search space for the optimal feature explosively grows on the basis of combinations of features and operations from low-order forms to high-order forms. Existing methods, such as exhaustive search, expansion reduction, evolutionary algorithms, reinforcement learning, and iterative greedy, suffer from large search space. Overly emphasizing efficiency in algorithm design usually sacrifice stability or robustness. To fundamentally fill this gap, we reformulate discrete feature transformation as a continuous space optimization task and develop an embedding-optimization-reconstruction framework. This framework includes four steps: 1) reinforcement-enhanced data preparation, aiming to prepare high-quality transformation-accuracy training data; 2) feature transformation operation sequence embedding, intending to encapsulate the knowledge of prepared training data within a continuous space; 3) gradient-steered optimal embedding search, dedicating to uncover potentially superior embeddings within the learned space; 4) transformation operation sequence reconstruction, striving to reproduce the feature transformation solution to pinpoint the optimal feature space. Finally, extensive experiments and case studies are performed to demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method.

They all wish to estimate the mean $\\mu$. By sharing data with each other, agents can obtain better estimates while keeping the cost of data collection small. To facilitate this collaboration, we wish to design mechanisms that encourage agents to collect a sufficient amount of data and share it truthfully, so that they are all better off than working alone. In naive mechanisms, such as simply pooling and sharing all the data, an individual agent might find it beneficial to under-collect and/or fabricate data, which can lead to poor social outcomes. We design a novel mechanism that overcomes these challenges via two key techniques: first, when sharing the others' data with an agent, the mechanism corrupts this dataset proportional to how much the data reported by the agent differs from the others; second, we design minimax optimal estimators for the corrupted dataset. Our mechanism, which is Nash incentive compatible and individually rational, achieves a social penalty (sum of all agents' estimation errors and data collection costs) that is at most a factor 2 of the global minimum. When applied to high dimensional (non-Gaussian) distributions with bounded variance, this mechanism retains these three properties, but with slightly weaker results. Finally, in two special cases where we restrict the strategy space of the agents, we design mechanisms that essentially achieve the global minimum",

    "title": "Uncovering the Hidden Dynamics of Video Self-supervised Learning under Distribution Shifts",
    "volume": "spotlight",
    "abstract": "Video self-supervised learning (VSSL) has made significant progress in recent years. However, the exact behavior and dynamics of these models under different forms of distribution shift are not yet known. In this paper, we comprehensively study the behavior of six popular self-supervised methods (v-SimCLR, v-MoCo, v-BYOL, v-SimSiam, v-DINO, v-MAE) in response to various forms of natural distribution shift, i.e., (i) context shift, (ii) viewpoint shift, (iii) actor shift, (iv) source shift, (v) generalizability to unknown classes (zero-shot), and (vi) open-set recognition. To perform this extensive study, we carefully craft a test bed consisting of 17 in-distribution and out-of-distribution benchmark pairs using available public datasets and a series of evaluation protocols to stress-test the different methods under the intended shifts. Our study uncovers a series of intriguing findings and interesting behaviors of VSSL methods. For instance, we observe that while video models generally struggle with context shifts, v-MAE and supervised learning exhibit more robustness. Moreover, our study shows that v-MAE is a strong temporal learner, whereas contrastive methods, v-SimCLR and v-MoCo, exhibit strong performances against viewpoint shifts. When studying the notion of open-set recognition, we notice a trade-off between closed-set and open-set recognition performance if the pretrained VSSL encoders are used without finetuning. We hope that our work will contribute to the development of robust video representation learning frameworks for various real-world scenarios.

Most of the existing methods aim to discover causal relationships among all variables within a complex large-scale graph. However, in practice, only a small subset of variables in the graph are relevant to the outcomes of interest. Consequently, causal estimation with the full causal graph---particularly given limited data---could lead to numerous *falsely discovered, spurious* variables that exhibit high correlation with, but exert no causal impact on, the target outcome. In this paper, we propose learning a class of *necessary and sufficient causal graphs (NSCG)* that exclusively comprises causally relevant variables for an outcome of interest, which we term *causal features*. The key idea is to employ *probabilities of causation* to systematically evaluate the importance of features in the causal graph, allowing us to identify a subgraph relevant to the outcome of interest. To learn NSCG from data, we develop a *necessary and sufficient causal structural learning (NSCSL)* algorithm, by establishing theoretical properties and relationships between probabilities of causation and natural causal effects of features. Across empirical studies of simulated and real data, we demonstrate that NSCSL outperforms existing algorithms and can reveal crucial yeast genes for target heritable traits of interest",

Given a fixed budget of tokens, we study how to best select data that leads to good downstream model performance across tasks. We develop a new framework based on a simple hypothesis: just as humans acquire interdependent skills in a deliberate order, language models also follow a natural order when learning a set of skills from their training data. If such an order exists, it can be utilized for improved understanding of LMs and for data-efficient training. Using this intuition, our framework formalizes the notion of a skill and of an ordered set of skills in terms of the associated data. First, using both synthetic and real data, we demonstrate that these ordered skill sets exist, and that their existence enables more advanced skills to be learned with less data when we train on their prerequisite skills. Second, using our proposed framework, we introduce an online data sampling algorithm, Skill-It, over mixtures of skills for both continual pre-training and fine-tuning regimes, where the objective is to efficiently learn multiple skills in the former and an individual skill in the latter. On the LEGO synthetic in the continual pre-training setting, Skill-It obtains 37.5 points higher accuracy than random sampling. On the Natural Instructions dataset in the fine-tuning setting, Skill-It reduces the validation loss on the target skill by 13.6% versus training on data associated with the target skill itself.

Recent work, however, has shown that intervention efficacy can be highly dependent on the order in which concepts are intervened on and on the model's architecture and training hyperparameters. We argue that this is rooted in a CBM's lack of train-time incentives for the model to be appropriately receptive to concept interventions. To address this, we propose Intervention-aware Concept Embedding models (IntCEMs), a novel CBM-based architecture and training paradigm that improves a model's receptiveness to test-time interventions. Our model learns a concept intervention policy in an end-to-end fashion from where it can sample meaningful intervention trajectories at train-time.

A typical model ingests hundreds of features with vocabularies on the order of millions to billions of tokens. The standard approach is to represent each feature value as a $d$-dimensional embedding, which introduces hundreds of billions of parameters for extremely high-cardinality features. This bottleneck has led to substantial progress in alternative embedding algorithms. Many of these methods, however, make the assumption that each feature uses an independent embedding table. This work introduces a simple yet highly effective framework, Feature Multiplexing, where one single representation space is used for many different categorical features. Our theoretical and empirical analysis reveals that multiplexed embeddings can be decomposed into components from each constituent feature, allowing models to distinguish between features. We show that multiplexed representations give Pareto-optimal space-accuracy tradeoffs for three public benchmark datasets. Further, we propose a highly practical approach called Unified Embedding with three major benefits: simplified feature configuration, strong adaptation to dynamic data distributions, and compatibility with modern hardware.

The randomization avoids overfitting locally in time and so helps prevent the error from accumulating quickly over the sequential-in-time training, which is motivated by dropout that addresses a similar issue of overfitting due to neuron co-adaptation. The sparsity of the update reduces the computational costs of training without losing expressiveness because many of the network parameters are redundant locally at each time step.

    "title": "Bypassing spike sorting: Density-based decoding using spike localization from dense multielectrode probes",
    "volume": "spotlight",
    "abstract": "Neural decoding and its applications to brain computer interfaces (BCI) are essential for understanding the association between neural activity and behavior. A prerequisite for many decoding approaches is spike sorting, the assignment of action potentials (spikes) to individual neurons. Current spike sorting algorithms, however, can be inaccurate and do not properly model uncertainty of spike assignments, therefore discarding information that could potentially improve decoding performance. Recent advances in high-density probes (e.g., Neuropixels) and computational methods now allow for extracting a rich set of spike features from unsorted data; these features can in turn be used to directly decode behavioral correlates. To this end, we propose a spike sorting-free decoding method that directly models the distribution of extracted spike features using a mixture of Gaussians (MoG) encoding the uncertainty of spike assignments, without aiming to solve the spike clustering problem explicitly. We allow the mixing proportion of the MoG to change over time in response to the behavior and develop variational inference methods to fit the resulting model and to perform decoding. We benchmark our method with an extensive suite of recordings from different animals and probe geometries, demonstrating that our proposed decoder can consistently outperform current methods based on thresholding (i.e. multi-unit activity) and spike sorting.

    "abstract": "Instance segmentation in 3D is a challenging task due to the lack of large-scale annotated datasets. In this paper, we show that this task can be addressed effectively by leveraging instead 2D pre-trained models for instance segmentation. We propose a novel approach to lift 2D segments to 3D and fuse them by means of a neural field representation, which encourages multi-view consistency across frames. The core of our approach is a slow-fast clustering objective function, which is scalable and well-suited for scenes with a large number of objects. Unlike previous approaches, our method does not require an upper bound on the number of objects or object tracking across frames. To demonstrate the scalability of the slow-fast clustering, we create a new semi-realistic dataset called the Messy Rooms dataset, which features scenes with up to 500 objects per scene. Our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art on challenging scenes from the ScanNet, Hypersim, and Replica datasets, as well as on our newly created Messy Rooms dataset, demonstrating the effectiveness and scalability of our slow-fast clustering method",

It comprises two components: (1) A statistical method for eliciting beliefs encoded in LLMs. We introduce statistical measures and evaluation metrics that quantify the probability of an LLM \"making a choice\", the associated uncertainty, and the consistency of that choice. (2) We apply this method to study what moral beliefs are encoded in different LLMs, especially in ambiguous cases where the right choice is not obvious. We design a large-scale survey comprising 680 high-ambiguity moral scenarios (e.g., \"Should I tell a white lie?\") and 687 low-ambiguity moral scenarios (e.g., \"Should I stop for a pedestrian on the road?\"). Each scenario includes a description, two possible actions, and auxiliary labels indicating violated rules (e.g., \"do not kill\"). We administer the survey to 28 open- and closed-source LLMs. We find that (a) in unambiguous scenarios, most models ``choose\" actions that align with commonsense. In ambiguous cases, most models express uncertainty. (b) Some models are uncertain about choosing the commonsense action because their responses are sensitive to the question-wording. (c) Some models reflect clear preferences in ambiguous scenarios. Specifically, closed-source models tend to agree with each other",

    "abstract": "Language is often considered a key aspect of human thinking, providing us with exceptional abilities to generalize, explore, plan, replan, and adapt to new situations. However, Reinforcement Learning (RL) agents are far from human-level performance in any of these abilities. We hypothesize one reason for such cognitive deficiencies is that they lack the benefits of thinking in language and that we can improve AI agents by training them to $\\textit{think like humans do}$. We introduce a novel Imitation Learning framework, Thought Cloning, where the idea is to not just clone the behaviors of human demonstrators, $\\textit{but also the thoughts humans have as they perform these behaviors}$. While we expect Thought Cloning to truly shine at scale on internet-sized datasets (e.g. online videos with transcripts), here we conduct experiments in a domain where the thinking and action data are synthetically generated. Results reveal that Thought Cloning learns much faster than Behavioral Cloning and its performance advantage grows the further out of distribution test tasks are, highlighting its ability to better handle novel situations. Thought Cloning also provides important benefits for AI Safety and Interpretability, and makes it easier to debug and improve AI. Because we can observe the agent's thoughts, we can (1) more easily diagnose why things are going wrong, making it easier to fix the problem, (2) steer the agent by correcting its thinking, or (3) prevent it from doing unsafe things it plans to do. Overall, by training agents $\\textit{how to think}$ as well as behave, Thought Cloning creates safer, more powerful agents",

In contrast, recent large language models exhibit a wide range of capabilities, hinting at a possibility for similarly versatile models in computer vision. In this paper, we take a step in this direction and propose a multimodal training scheme called 4M. It consists of training a single unified Transformer encoder-decoder using a masked modeling objective across a wide range of input/output modalities – including text, images, geometric, and semantic modalities, as well as neural network feature maps. 4M achieves scalability by unifying the representation space of all modalities through mapping them into discrete tokens and performing multimodal masked modeling on a small randomized subset of tokens. 4M leads to models that exhibit several key capabilities: (1) they can perform a diverse set of vision tasks out of the box, (2) they excel when fine-tuned for unseen downstream tasks or new input modalities, and (3) they can function as a generative model that can be conditioned on arbitrary modalities, enabling a wide variety of expressive multimodal editing capabilities with remarkable flexibility. Through experimental analyses, we demonstrate the potential of 4M for training versatile and scalable foundation models for vision tasks, setting the stage for further exploration in multimodal learning for vision and other domains",

Recent progress in text-guided image synthesis has yielded models with an impressive ability to generate complex novel images, exhibiting combinatorial generalization across domains. Motivated by this success, we investigate whether such tools can be used to construct more general-purpose agents. Specifically, we cast the sequential decision making problem as a text-conditioned video generation problem, where, given a text-encoded specification of a desired goal, a planner synthesizes a set of future frames depicting its planned actions in the future, after which control actions are extracted from the generated video. By leveraging text as the underlying goal specification, we are able to naturally and combinatorially generalize to novel goals. The proposed policy-as-video formulation can further represent environments with different state and action spaces in a unified space of images, which, for example, enables learning and generalization across a variety of robot manipulation tasks.

    "title": "Optimal Exploration for Model-Based RL in Nonlinear Systems",
    "volume": "spotlight",
    "abstract": "Learning to control unknown nonlinear dynamical systems is a fundamental problem in reinforcement learning and control theory. A commonly applied approach is to first explore the environment (exploration), learn an accurate model of it (system identification), and then compute an optimal controller with the minimum cost on this estimated system (policy optimization). While existing work has shown that it is possible to learn a uniformly good model of the system (Mania et al., 2020), in practice, if we aim to learn a good controller with a low cost on the actual system, certain system parameters may be significantly more critical than others, and we therefore ought to focus our exploration on learning such parameters. In this work, we consider the setting of nonlinear dynamical systems and seek to formally quantify, in such settings, (a) which parameters are most relevant to learning a good controller, and (b) how we can best explore so as to minimize uncertainty in such parameters. Inspired by recent work in linear systems (Wagenmaker et al., 2021), we show that minimizing the controller loss in nonlinear systems translates to estimating the system parameters in a particular, task-dependent metric. Motivated by this, we develop an algorithm able to efficiently explore the system to reduce uncertainty in this metric, and prove a lower bound showing that our approach learns a controller at a near-instance-optimal rate. Our algorithm relies on a general reduction from policy optimization to optimal experiment design in arbitrary systems, and may be of independent interest. We conclude with experiments demonstrating the effectiveness of our method in realistic nonlinear robotic systems",

    "abstract": "Learning accurate and parsimonious point cloud representations of scene surfaces from scratch remains a challenge in 3D representation learning. Existing point-based methods often suffer from the vanishing gradient problem or require a large number of points to accurately model scene geometry and texture. To address these limitations, we propose Proximity Attention Point Rendering (PAPR), a novel method that consists of a point-based scene representation and a differentiable renderer. Our scene representation uses a point cloud where each point is characterized by its spatial position, foreground score, and view-independent feature vector. The renderer selects the relevant points for each ray and produces accurate colours using their associated features. PAPR effectively learns point cloud positions to represent the correct scene geometry, even when the initialization drastically differs from the target geometry. Notably, our method captures fine texture details while using only a parsimonious set of points. We also demonstrate four practical applications of our method: geometry editing, object manipulation, texture transfer, and exposure control.

However, the standard coupling architecture precludes endowing flows that operate on the Cartesian coordinates of atoms with the SE(3) and permutation invariances of physical systems. This work proposes a coupling flow that preserves SE(3) and permutation equivariance by performing coordinate splits along additional augmented dimensions. At each layer, the flow maps atoms' positions into learned SE(3) invariant bases, where we apply standard flow transformations, such as monotonic rational-quadratic splines, before returning to the original basis. Crucially, our flow preserves fast sampling and density evaluation, and may be used to produce unbiased estimates of expectations with respect to the target distribution via importance sampling. When trained on the DW4, LJ13, and QM9-positional datasets, our flow is competitive with equivariant continuous normalizing flows, while allowing sampling more than an order of magnitude faster. Moreover, to the best of our knowledge, we are the first to learn the full Boltzmann distribution of alanine dipeptide by only modeling the Cartesian positions of its atoms. Lastly, we demonstrate that our flow can be trained to approximately sample from the Boltzmann distribution of the DW4 and LJ13 particle systems using only their energy functions",

    "abstract": "Liquid democracy with ranked delegations is a novel voting scheme that unites the practicability of representative democracy with the idealistic appeal of direct democracy: Every voter decides between casting their vote on a question at hand or delegating their voting weight to some other, trusted agent. Delegations are transitive, and since voters may end up in a delegation cycle, they are encouraged to indicate not only a single delegate, but a set of potential delegates and a ranking among them. Based on the delegation preferences of all voters, a delegation rule selects one representative per voter. Previous work has revealed a trade-off between two properties of delegation rules called anonymity and copy-robustness. To overcome this issue we study two fractional delegation rules: Mixed Borda branching, which generalizes a rule satisfying copy-robustness, and the random walk rule, which satisfies anonymity. Using the Markov chain tree theorem, we show that the two rules are in fact equivalent, and simultaneously satisfy generalized versions of the two properties. Combining the same theorem with Fulkerson's algorithm, we develop a polynomial-time algorithm for computing the outcome of the studied delegation rule. This algorithm is of independent interest, having applications in semi-supervised learning and graph theory",

We show how the order of expected regret exactly affects the decaying rate of the regret tail probability for both the worst-case and instance-dependent scenario. A novel policy is proposed to achieve the optimal regret tail risk for any regret threshold. Concretely, for any given $\\alpha\\in[1/2, 1)$ and $\\beta\\in[0, 1)$, our policy achieves a worst-case expected regret of $\\tilde O(T^\\alpha)$ and instance-dependent expected regret of $\\tilde O(T^\\beta)$, while enjoys a probability of incurring an $\\Omega(T^\\delta)$ regret that decays exponentially with a polynomial $T$ term. Such decaying rate is proved to be best achievable. We also generalize our analysis to the stochastic multi-armed bandit problem with non-stationary baseline rewards, where in each time period $t$, the decision maker pulls one of $K$ arms and collects a reward which is the sum of three terms: the mean of the pulled arm, an independent noise, and a non-stationary baseline reward as a function of $t$.

    "volume": "spotlight",
    "abstract": "One of the remarkable properties of robust computer vision models is that their input-gradients are often aligned with human perception, referred to in the literature as perceptually-aligned gradients (PAGs). Despite only being trained for classification, PAGs cause robust models to have rudimentary generative capabilities, including image generation, denoising, and in-painting. However, the underlying mechanisms behind these phenomena remain unknown. In this work, we provide a first explanation of PAGs via \\emph{off-manifold robustness}, which states that models must be more robust off- the data manifold than they are on-manifold. We first demonstrate theoretically that off-manifold robustness leads input gradients to lie approximately on the data manifold, explaining their perceptual alignment. We then show that Bayes optimal models satisfy off-manifold robustness, and confirm the same empirically for robust models trained via gradient norm regularization, randomized smoothing, and adversarial training with projected gradient descent. Quantifying the perceptual alignment of model gradients via their similarity with the gradients of generative models, we show that off-manifold robustness correlates well with perceptual alignment. Finally, based on the levels of on- and off-manifold robustness, we identify three different regimes of robustness that affect both perceptual alignment and model accuracy: weak robustness, bayes-aligned robustness, and excessive robustness.

To study this, we prove optimal contraction rates for intrinsic Matérn Gaussian processes defined on compact Riemannian manifolds. We also prove analogous rates for extrinsic processes using trace and extension theorems between manifold and ambient Sobolev spaces: somewhat surprisingly, the rates obtained turn out to coincide with those of the intrinsic processes, provided that their smoothness parameters are matched appropriately. We illustrate these rates empirically on a number of examples, which, mirroring prior work, show that intrinsic processes can achieve better performance in practice.

    "title": "Differentially Private Approximate Near Neighbor Counting in High Dimensions",
    "volume": "spotlight",
    "abstract": "Range counting (e.g., counting the number of data points falling into a given query ball) under differential privacy has been studied extensively. However, the current algorithms for this problem are subject to the following dichotomy. One class of algorithms suffers from an additive error that is a fixed polynomial in the number of points. Another class of algorithms allows for polylogarithmic additive error, but the error grows exponentially in the dimension. To achieve the latter, the problem is relaxed to allow a \"fuzzy\" definition of the range boundary, e.g., a count of the points in a ball of radius $r$ might also include points in a ball of radius $cr$ for some $c>1$. In this paper we present an efficient algorithm that offers a sweet spot between these two classes. The algorithm has an additive error that is an arbitrary small power of the data set size, depending on how fuzzy the range boundary is, as well as a small ($1+o(1)$) multiplicative error. Crucially, the amount of noise added has no dependence on the dimension. Our algorithm introduces a variant of Locality-Sensitive Hashing, utilizing it in a novel manner",

    "title": "Model Sparsity Can Simplify Machine Unlearning",
    "volume": "spotlight",
    "abstract": "In response to recent data regulation requirements, machine unlearning (MU) has emerged as a critical process to remove the influence of specific examples from a given model. Although exact unlearning can be achieved through complete model retraining using the remaining dataset, the associated computational costs have driven the development of efficient, approximate unlearning techniques. Moving beyond data-centric MU approaches, our study introduces a novel model-based perspective: model sparsification via weight pruning, which is capable of reducing the gap between exact unlearning and approximate unlearning. We show in both theory and practice that model sparsity can boost the multi-criteria unlearning performance of an approximate unlearner, closing the approximation gap, while continuing to be efficient. This leads to a new MU paradigm, termed prune first, then unlearn, which infuses a sparse prior to the unlearning process. Building on this insight, we also develop a sparsity-aware unlearning method that utilizes sparsity regularization to enhance the training process of approximate unlearning. Extensive experiments show that our proposals consistently benefit MU in various unlearning scenarios. A notable highlight is the 77% unlearning efficacy gain of fine-tuning (one of the simplest approximate unlearning methods) when using our proposed sparsity-aware unlearning method. Furthermore, we showcase the practical impact of our proposed MU methods through two specific use cases: defending against backdoor attacks, and enhancing transfer learning through source class removal. These applications demonstrate the versatility and effectiveness of our approaches in addressing a variety of machine learning challenges beyond unlearning for data privacy.

    "abstract": "Though modern neural networks have achieved impressive performance in both vision and language tasks, we know little about the functions that they implement. One possibility is that neural networks implicitly break down complex tasks into subroutines, implement modular solutions to these subroutines, and compose them into an overall solution to a task --- a property we term structural compositionality. Another possibility is that they may simply learn to match new inputs to learned templates, eliding task decomposition entirely. Here, we leverage model pruning techniques to investigate this question in both vision and language across a variety of architectures, tasks, and pretraining regimens. Our results demonstrate that models oftentimes implement solutions to subroutines via modular subnetworks, which can be ablated while maintaining the functionality of other subnetworks. This suggests that neural networks may be able to learn compositionality, obviating the need for specialized symbolic mechanisms",

    "abstract": "Recalibrating probabilistic classifiers is vital for enhancing the reliability and accuracy of predictive models. Despite the development of numerous recalibration algorithms, there is still a lack of a comprehensive theory that integrates calibration and sharpness (which is essential for maintaining predictive power). In this paper, we introduce the concept of minimum-risk recalibration within the framework of mean-squared-error (MSE) decomposition, offering a principled approach for evaluating and recalibrating probabilistic classifiers. Using this framework, we analyze the uniform-mass binning (UMB) recalibration method and establish a finite-sample risk upper bound of order $\\tilde{O}(B/n + 1/B^2)$ where $B$ is the number of bins and $n$ is the sample size. By balancing calibration and sharpness, we further determine that the optimal number of bins for UMB scales with $n^{1/3}$, resulting in a risk bound of approximately $O(n^{-2/3})$. Additionally, we tackle the challenge of label shift by proposing a two-stage approach that adjusts the recalibration function using limited labeled data from the target domain. Our results show that transferring a calibrated classifier requires significantly fewer target samples compared to recalibrating from scratch. We validate our theoretical findings through numerical simulations, which confirm the tightness of the proposed bounds, the optimal number of bins, and the effectiveness of label shift adaptation",

    "abstract": "We present a simple but effective method to measure and mitigate model biases caused by reliance on spurious cues. Instead of requiring costly changes to one's data or model training, our method better utilizes the data one already has by sorting them. Specifically, we rank images within their classes based on spuriosity (the degree to which common spurious cues are present), proxied via deep neural features of an interpretable network. With spuriosity rankings, it is easy to identify minority subpopulations (i.e. low spuriosity images) and assess model bias as the gap in accuracy between high and low spuriosity images. One can even efficiently remove a model's bias at little cost to accuracy by finetuning its classification head on low spuriosity images, resulting in fairer treatment of samples regardless of spuriosity. We demonstrate our method on ImageNet, annotating $5000$ class-feature dependencies ($630$ of which we find to be spurious) and generating a dataset of $325k$ soft segmentations for these features along the way. Having computed spuriosity rankings via the identified spurious neural features, we assess biases for $89$ diverse models and find that class-wise biases are highly correlated across models. Our results suggest that model bias due to spurious feature reliance is influenced far more by what the model is trained on than how it is trained",

While detection training data can be expanded by using Web image-text pairs as weak supervision, this has not been done at scales comparable to image-level pretraining. Here, we scale up detection data with self-training, which uses an existing detector to generate pseudo-box annotations on image-text pairs. Major challenges in scaling self-training are the choice of label space, pseudo-annotation filtering, and training efficiency. We present the OWLv2 model and OWL-ST self-training recipe, which address these challenges. OWLv2 surpasses the performance of previous state-of-the-art open-vocabulary detectors already at comparable training scales (~10M examples). However, with OWL-ST, we can scale to over 1B examples, yielding further large improvement: With an L/14 architecture, OWL-ST improves AP on LVIS rare classes, for which the model has seen no human box annotations, from 31.2% to 44.6% (43% relative improvement).

    "title": "Auditing for Human Expertise",
    "volume": "spotlight",
    "abstract": "High-stakes prediction tasks (e.g., patient diagnosis) are often handled by trained human experts. A common source of concern about automation in these settings is that experts may exercise intuition that is difficult to model and/or have access to information (e.g., conversations with a patient) that is simply unavailable to a would-be algorithm. This raises a natural question whether human experts add value which could not be captured by an algorithmic predictor. We develop a statistical framework under which we can pose this question as a natural hypothesis test. Indeed, as our framework highlights, detecting human expertise is more subtle than simply comparing the accuracy of expert predictions to those made by a particular learning algorithm. Instead, we propose a simple procedure which tests whether expert predictions are statistically independent from the outcomes of interest after conditioning on the available inputs (‘features'). A rejection of our test thus suggests that human experts may add value to any algorithm trained on the available data, and has direct implications for whether human-AI ‘complementarity' is achievable in a given prediction task. We highlight the utility of our procedure using admissions data collected from the emergency department of a large academic hospital system, where we show that physicians' admit/discharge decisions for patients with acute gastrointestinal bleeding (AGIB) appear to be incorporating information that is not available to a standard algorithmic screening tool. This is despite the fact that the screening tool is arguably more accurate than physicians' discretionary decisions, highlighting that – even absent normative concerns about accountability or interpretability – accuracy is insufficient to justify algorithmic automation",

Our framework considers random sampling according to a finite number of sampling measures and arbitrary nonlinear approximation spaces (model classes). We introduce the concept of \\textit{generalized Christoffel functions} and show how these can be used to optimize the sampling measures. We prove that this leads to near-optimal sample complexity in various important cases. This paper focuses on applications in scientific computing, where active learning is often desirable, since it is usually expensive to generate data.

Powerful as these models can be, they are not grounded in the 3D physical world, which involves richer concepts such as spatial relationships, affordances, physics, layout, and so on. In this work, we propose to inject the 3D world into large language models, and introduce a whole new family of 3D-LLMs. Specifically, 3D-LLMs can take 3D point clouds and their features as input and perform a diverse set of 3D-related tasks, including captioning, dense captioning, 3D question answering, task decomposition, 3D grounding, 3D-assisted dialog, navigation, and so on. Using three types of prompting mechanisms that we design, we are able to collect over 300k 3D-language data covering these tasks. To efficiently train 3D-LLMs, we first utilize a 3D feature extractor that obtains 3D features from rendered multi-view images. Then, we use 2D VLMs as our backbones to train our 3D-LLMs. By introducing a 3D localization mechanism, 3D-LLMs could better capture 3D spatial information. Experiments on ScanQA show that our model outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by a large margin (\\textit{e.g.}, the BLEU-1 score surpasses state-of-the-art score by 9\\%). Furthermore, experiments on our held-in datasets for 3D captioning, task composition, and 3D-assisted dialogue show that our model outperforms 2D VLMs. Qualitative examples also show that our model could perform more tasks beyond the scope of existing LLMs and VLMs. Our model and data will be publicly available",

In this work, we consider a generalization of the discrete-time, finite-horizon LQG problem, where the noise distributions are unknown and belong to Wasserstein ambiguity sets centered at nominal (Gaussian) distributions. The objective is to minimize a worst-case cost across all distributions in the ambiguity set, including non-Gaussian distributions. Despite the added complexity, we prove that a control policy that is linear in the observations is optimal for this problem, as in the classic LQG problem. We propose a numerical solution method that efficiently characterizes this optimal control policy.

The interaction and corrective feedback from human brings safety and AI alignment to the learning process. In this work, we propose a new reward-free active human involvement method called Proxy Value Propagation for policy optimization. Our key insight is that a proxy value function can be designed to express human intents, wherein state- action pairs in the human demonstration are labeled with high values, while those agents' actions that are intervened receive low values. Through the TD-learning framework, labeled values of demonstrated state-action pairs are further propagated to other unlabeled data generated from agents' exploration. The proxy value function thus induces a policy that faithfully emulates human behaviors. Human- in-the-loop experiments show the generality and efficiency of our method.

However, this dependence can significantly constrain the true potential of AI-assistant agents due to the high cost of obtaining human supervision and the related issues on quality, reliability, diversity, self-consistency, and undesirable biases. To address these challenges, we propose a novel approach called SELF-ALIGN, which combines principle-driven reasoning and the generative power of LLMs for the self-alignment of AI agents with minimal human supervision. Our approach encompasses four stages: first, we use an LLM to generate synthetic prompts, and a topic-guided method to augment the prompt diversity; second, we use a small set of human-written principles for AI models to follow, and guide the LLM through in-context learning from demonstrations (of principles application) to produce helpful, ethical, and reliable responses to user's queries; third, we fine-tune the original LLM with the high-quality self-aligned responses so that the resulting model can generate desirable responses for each query directly without the principle set and the demonstrations anymore; and finally, we offer a refinement step to address the issues of overly-brief or indirect responses. Applying SELF-ALIGN to the LLaMA-65b base language model, we develop an AI assistant named Dromedary.

However, their applicability is limited to scenarios where training samples are readily available, which is not always the case in real-world applications. For example, in inverse graphics, the goal is to generate samples from a distribution of 3D scenes that align with a given image, but ground-truth 3D scenes are unavailable and only 2D images are accessible. To address this limitation, we propose a novel class of denoising diffusion probabilistic models that learn to sample from distributions of signals that are never directly observed. Instead, these signals are measured indirectly through a known differentiable forward model, which produces partial observations of the unknown signal. Our approach involves integrating the forward model directly into the denoising process. A key contribution of our work is the integration of a differentiable forward model into the denoising process. This integration effectively connects the generative modeling of observations with the generative modeling of the underlying signals, allowing for end-to-end training of a conditional generative model over signals. During inference, our approach enables sampling from the distribution of underlying signals that are consistent with a given partial observation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on three challenging computer vision tasks.

Experimental results show that DIFUSCO strongly outperforms the previous state-of-the-art neural solvers, improving the performance gap between ground-truth and neural solvers from 1.76% to 0.46% on TSP-500, from 2.46% to 1.17% on TSP-1000, and from 3.19% to 2.58% on TSP-10000. For the MIS problem, DIFUSCO outperforms the previous state-of-the-art neural solver on the challenging SATLIB benchmark. Our code is available at [this url](https://github.com/Edward-Sun/DIFUSCO)",

    "volume": "spotlight",
    "abstract": "It has been well established that increasing scale in deep transformer networks leads to improved quality and performance. However, this increase in scale often comes with prohibitive increases in compute cost and inference latency. We introduce Alternating Updates (AltUp), a simple-to-implement method to increase a model's capacity without the computational burden. AltUp enables the widening of the learned representation, i.e., the token embedding, while only incurring a negligible increase in latency. AltUp achieves this by working on a subblock of the widened representation at each layer and using a predict-and-correct mechanism to update the inactivated blocks. We present extensions of AltUp, such as its applicability to the sequence dimension, and demonstrate how AltUp can be synergistically combined with existing approaches, such as Sparse Mixture-of-Experts models, to obtain efficient models with even higher capacity. Our experiments on benchmark transformer models and language tasks demonstrate the consistent effectiveness of AltUp on a diverse set of scenarios. Notably, on SuperGLUE and SQuAD benchmarks, AltUp enables up to $87\\%$ speedup relative to the dense baselines at the same accuracy",

Our approach leverages convex relaxation techniques in the recently-proposed nonstochastic control framework to overcome the challenge of nonconvexity, and obtains regret guarantees vs. the best offline solution.

    "volume": "spotlight",
    "abstract": "Since their initial introduction, score-based diffusion models (SDMs) have been successfully applied to solve a variety of linear inverse problems in finite-dimensional vector spaces due to their ability to efficiently approximate the posterior distribution. However, using SDMs for inverse problems in infinite-dimensional function spaces has only been addressed recently, primarily through methods that learn the unconditional score. While this approach is advantageous for some inverse problems, it is mostly heuristic and involves numerous computationally costly forward operator evaluations during posterior sampling. To address these limitations, we propose a theoretically grounded method for sampling from the posterior of infinite-dimensional Bayesian linear inverse problems based on amortized conditional SDMs. In particular, we prove that one of the most successful approaches for estimating the conditional score in finite dimensions—the conditional denoising estimator—can also be applied in infinite dimensions. A significant part of our analysis is dedicated to demonstrating that extending infinite-dimensional SDMs to the conditional setting requires careful consideration, as the conditional score typically blows up for small times, contrarily to the unconditional score. We conclude by presenting stylized and large-scale numerical examples that validate our approach, offer additional insights, and demonstrate that our method enables large-scale, discretization-invariant Bayesian inference",

In typical deep-learning applications, an explicit geometric description of the model is impossible, but parallax can estimate topological features (components, cycles, voids, etc.) in the model by examining the effect on the Rips complex of geodesic distortions using the reference dataset. Thus, parallax indicates whether the model shares similar multiscale geometric features with the dataset. Parallax presents theoretically via topological data analysis [TDA] as a bi-filtered persistence module, and the key properties of this module are stable under perturbation of the reference dataset",

    "title": "Distance-Restricted Folklore Weisfeiler-Leman GNNs with Provable Cycle Counting Power",
    "volume": "spotlight",
    "abstract": "The ability of graph neural networks (GNNs) to count certain graph substructures, especially cycles, is important for the success of GNNs on a wide range of tasks. It has been recently used as a popular metric for evaluating the expressive power of GNNs. Many of the proposed GNN models with provable cycle counting power are based on subgraph GNNs, i.e., extracting a bag of subgraphs from the input graph, generating representations for each subgraph, and using them to augment the representation of the input graph. However, those methods require heavy preprocessing, and suffer from high time and memory costs. In this paper, we overcome the aforementioned limitations of subgraph GNNs by proposing a novel class of GNNs---$d$-Distance-Restricted FWL(2) GNNs, or $d$-DRFWL(2) GNNs, based on the well-known FWL(2) algorithm. As a heuristic method for graph isomorphism testing, FWL(2) colors all node pairs in a graph and performs message passing among those node pairs. In order to balance the expressive power and complexity, $d$-DRFWL(2) GNNs simplify FWL(2) by restricting the range of message passing to node pairs whose mutual distances are at most $d$. This way, $d$-DRFWL(2) GNNs exploit graph sparsity while avoiding the expensive subgraph extraction operations in subgraph GNNs, making both the time and space complexity lower. We theoretically investigate both the discriminative power and the cycle counting power of $d$-DRFWL(2) GNNs. Our most important finding is that $d$-DRFWL(2) GNNs have provably strong cycle counting power even with $d=2$: they can count all 3, 4, 5, 6-cycles. Since 6-cycles (e.g., benzene rings) are ubiquitous in organic molecules, being able to detect and count them is crucial for achieving robust and generalizable performance on molecular tasks. Experiments on both synthetic datasets and molecular datasets verify our theory. To the best of our knowledge, 2-DRFWL(2) GNN is the most efficient GNN model to date (both theoretically and empirically) that can count up to 6-cycles",

Many different state-of-the-art deep neural networks yield similar neural predictions, but it remains unclear how to differentiate among models that perform equally well at predicting neural responses. To gain insight into this, we use a recent theoretical framework that relates the generalization error from regression to the spectral properties of the model and the target. We apply this theory to the case of regression between model activations and neural responses and decompose the neural prediction error in terms of the model eigenspectra, alignment of model eigenvectors and neural responses, and the training set size. Using this decomposition, we introduce geometrical measures to interpret the neural prediction error. We test a large number of deep neural networks that predict visual cortical activity and show that there are multiple types of geometries that result in low neural prediction error as measured via regression. The work demonstrates that carefully decomposing representational metrics can provide interpretability of how models are capturing neural activity and points the way towards improved models of neural activity",

In CSGs, a principal repeatedly interacts with an agent who (contrary to standard SGs) does not have direct access to the principal's action but instead best responds to _calibrated forecasts_ about it. CSG is a powerful modeling tool that goes beyond assuming that agents use ad hoc and highly specified algorithms for interacting in strategic settings to infer the principal's actions and thus more robustly addresses real-life applications that SGs were originally intended to capture. Along with CSGs, we also introduce a stronger notion of calibration, termed _adaptive calibration_, that provides fine-grained any-time calibration guarantees against adversarial sequences. We give a general approach for obtaining adaptive calibration algorithms and specialize them for finite CSGs. In our main technical result, we show that in CSGs, the principal can achieve utility that converges to the optimum Stackelberg value of the game both in _finite_ and _continuous_ settings and that no higher utility is achievable. Two prominent and immediate applications of our results are the settings of learning in Stackelberg Security Games and strategic classification, both against _calibrated_ agents",

Deep learning of geometric priors from 2D images requires each image to be represented in a $2D$ canonical frame and the prior to be learned in a given or learned $3D$ canonical frame. In this paper, given only the relative poses of the cameras, we show how to learn priors from multiple views equivariant to coordinate frame transformations by proposing an $SE(3)$-equivariant convolution and transformer in the space of rays in 3D. We model the ray space as a homogeneous space of $SE(3)$ and introduce the $SE(3)$-equivariant convolution in ray space. Depending on the output domain of the convolution, we present convolution-based $SE(3)$-equivariant maps from ray space to ray space and to $\\mathbb{R}^3$. Our mathematical framework allows us to go beyond convolution to $SE(3)$-equivariant attention in the ray space. We showcase how to tailor and adapt the equivariant convolution and transformer in the tasks of equivariant $3D$ reconstruction and equivariant neural rendering from multiple views.

Notably, EI and its variants, including for the parallel and multi-objective settings, are challenging to optimize because their acquisition values vanish numerically in many regions. This difficulty generally increases as the number of observations, dimensionality of the search space, or the number of constraints grow, resulting in performance that is inconsistent across the literature and most often sub-optimal. Herein, we propose LogEI, a new family of acquisition functions whose members either have identical or approximately equal optima as their canonical counterparts, but are substantially easier to optimize numerically. We demonstrate that numerical pathologies manifest themselves in \"classic\" analytic EI, Expected Hypervolume Improvement (EHVI), as well as their constrained, noisy, and parallel variants, and propose corresponding reformulations that remedy these pathologies. Our empirical results show that members of the LogEI family of acquisition functions substantially improve on the optimization performance of their canonical counterparts and surprisingly, are on par with or exceed the performance of recent state-of-the-art acquisition functions, highlighting the understated role of numerical optimization in the literature",

Recently, mostly due to the high computational cost of traditional solution techniques, deep neural network based surrogates have gained increased interest. The practical utility of such neural PDE solvers relies on their ability to provide accurate, stable predictions over long time horizons, which is a notoriously hard problem. In this work, we present a large-scale analysis of common temporal rollout strategies, identifying the neglect of non-dominant spatial frequency information, often associated with high frequencies in PDE solutions, as the primary pitfall limiting stable, accurate rollout performance. Based on these insights, we draw inspiration from recent advances in diffusion models to introduce PDE-Refiner; a novel model class that enables more accurate modeling of all frequency components via a multistep refinement process. We validate PDE-Refiner on challenging benchmarks of complex fluid dynamics, demonstrating stable and accurate rollouts that consistently outperform state-of-the-art models, including neural, numerical, and hybrid neural-numerical architectures. We further demonstrate that PDE-Refiner greatly enhances data efficiency, since the denoising objective implicitly induces a novel form of spectral data augmentation.

Existing methods for counterfactual inference with continuous outcomes aim at point identification and thus make strong and unnatural assumptions about the underlying structural causal model. In this paper, we relax these assumptions and aim at partial counterfactual identification of continuous outcomes, i.e., when the counterfactual query resides in an ignorance interval with informative bounds. We prove that, in general, the ignorance interval of the counterfactual queries has non-informative bounds, already when functions of structural causal models are continuously differentiable. As a remedy, we propose a novel sensitivity model called Curvature Sensitivity Model. This allows us to obtain informative bounds by bounding the curvature of level sets of the functions. We further show that existing point counterfactual identification methods are special cases of our Curvature Sensitivity Model when the bound of the curvature is set to zero. We then propose an implementation of our Curvature Sensitivity Model in the form of a novel deep generative model, which we call Augmented Pseudo-Invertible Decoder. Our implementation employs (i) residual normalizing flows with (ii) variational augmentations. We empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of our Augmented Pseudo-Invertible Decoder.

    "abstract": "Imitation learning (IL) algorithms excel in acquiring high-quality policies from expert data for sequential decision-making tasks. But, their effectiveness is hampered when faced with limited expert data. To tackle this challenge, a novel framework called (offline) IL with supplementary data has emerged, which enhances learning by incorporating an additional yet imperfect dataset obtained inexpensively from sub-optimal policies. Nonetheless, learning becomes challenging due to the potential inclusion of out-of-expert-distribution samples. In this work, we pioneer the mathematical formalization of this framework, uncovering its limitations. Our theoretical analysis reveals that a naive approach—applying the behavioral cloning (BC) algorithm concept to the combined set of expert and supplementary data—may fall short of vanilla BC, which solely relies on expert data. This deficiency arises due to the distribution shift between the two data sources. To address this issue, we propose a new importance-sampling-based technique for selecting data within the expert distribution. We prove that the proposed method theoretically eliminates the gap of the naive approach, highlighting its efficacy when handling imperfect data. Empirical studies demonstrate that our method outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods in tasks including robotics locomotion control, Atari video games, and image classification.

Several methods (such as difference-in-difference (DiD) estimator or negative outcome control) have been proposed in this setting in the literature. However, these approaches require either restrictive assumptions on the data generating model or having access to at least two proxy variables. We propose a method to estimate the causal effect using cross moments between the treatment, the outcome, and the proxy variable. In particular, we show that the causal effect can be identified with simple arithmetic operations on the cross moments if the latent confounder in linear SCM is non-Gaussian. In this setting, DiD estimator provides an unbiased estimate only in the special case where the latent confounder has exactly the same direct causal effects on the outcomes in the pre-treatment and post-treatment phases. This translates to the common trend assumption in DiD, which we effectively relax. Additionally, we provide an impossibility result that shows the causal effect cannot be identified if the observational distribution over the treatment, the outcome, and the proxy is jointly Gaussian. Our experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets showcase the effectiveness of the proposed approach in estimating the causal effect",

    "volume": "spotlight",
    "abstract": "Neural collapse (NC) refers to the surprising structure of the last layer of deep neural networks in the terminal phase of gradient descent training. Recently, an increasing amount of experimental evidence has pointed to the propagation of NC to earlier layers of neural networks. However, while the NC in the last layer is well studied theoretically, much less is known about its multi-layered counterpart - deep neural collapse (DNC). In particular, existing work focuses either on linear layers or only on the last two layers at the price of an extra assumption. Our work fills this gap by generalizing the established analytical framework for NC - the unconstrained features model - to multiple non-linear layers. Our key technical contribution is to show that, in a deep unconstrained features model, the unique global optimum for binary classification exhibits all the properties typical of DNC. This explains the existing experimental evidence of DNC. We also empirically show that (i) by optimizing deep unconstrained features models via gradient descent, the resulting solution agrees well with our theory, and (ii) trained networks recover the unconstrained features suitable for the occurrence of DNC, thus supporting the validity of this modeling principle",

    "abstract": "First-order optimization methods tend to inherently favor certain solutions over others when minimizing a given training objective with multiple local optima. This phenomenon, known as \\emph{implicit bias}, plays a critical role in understanding the generalization capabilities of optimization algorithms. Recent research has revealed that gradient-descent-based methods exhibit an implicit bias for the $\\ell_2$-maximal margin classifier in the context of separable binary classification. In contrast, generic optimization methods, such as mirror descent and steepest descent, have been shown to converge to maximal margin classifiers defined by alternative geometries. However, while gradient-descent-based algorithms demonstrate fast implicit bias rates, the implicit bias rates of generic optimization methods have been relatively slow. To address this limitation, in this paper, we present a series of state-of-the-art implicit bias rates for mirror descent and steepest descent algorithms. Our primary technique involves transforming a generic optimization algorithm into an online learning dynamic that solves a regularized bilinear game, providing a unified framework for analyzing the implicit bias of various optimization methods.

    "abstract": "Neural Architecture Search (NAS) is a promising paradigm in automatic architecture engineering. Zero-shot NAS can evaluate the network without training via some specific metrics called zero-cost proxies. Though effective, the existing zero-cost proxies either invoke at least one backpropagation or depend highly on the data and labels. To alleviate the above issues, in this paper, we first reveal how the Pearson correlation matrix of the feature maps impacts the convergence rate and the generalization capacity of an over-parameterized neural network. Enlightened by the theoretical analysis, we propose a novel zero-cost proxy called $\\mathsf{MeCo}$, which requires only one random data for a single forward pass. We further propose an optimization approach $\\mathsf{MeCo_{opt}}$ to improve the performance of our method. We design comprehensive experiments and extensively evaluate $\\mathsf{MeCo}$ on multiple popular benchmarks. $\\mathsf{MeCo}$ achieves the highest correlation with the ground truth (e.g., 0.89 on NATS-Bench-TSS with CIFAR-10) among all the state-of-the-art proxies, which is also fully independent of the data and labels. Moreover, we integrate $\\mathsf{MeCo}$ with the existing generation method to comprise a complete NAS. The experimental results illustrate that $\\mathsf{MeCo}$-based NAS can select the architecture with the highest accuracy and a low search cost. For instance, the best network searched by $\\mathsf{MeCo}$-based NAS achieves 97.31% on CIFAR-10, which is 0.04% higher than the baselines under the same settings.

Assuming each supervised task only depends on an unknown subset of the factors of variation, we disentangle the feature space of a supervised multi-task model, with features activating sparsely across different tasks and information being shared as appropriate. Importantly, we never directly observe the factors of variations but establish that access to multiple tasks is sufficient for identifiability under sufficiency and minimality assumptions. We validate our approach on six real world distribution shift benchmarks, and different data modalities (images, text), demonstrating how disentangled representations can be transferred to real settings",

AlphaStar is the first AI that beat human professionals in the full game of StarCraft II, using a league training framework that is inspired by a game-theoretic approach. In this paper, we improve AlphaStar's league training in two significant aspects. We train goal-conditioned exploiters, whose abilities of spotting weaknesses in the main agent and the entire league are greatly improved compared to the unconditioned exploiters in AlphaStar. In addition, we endow the agents in the league with the new ability of opponent modeling, which makes the agent more responsive to the opponent's real-time strategy. Based on these improvements, we train a better and superhuman AI with orders of magnitude less resources than AlphaStar (see Table 1 for a full comparison).

Brownian motion is a light-tailed process with continuous paths, which leads to a slow convergence rate for the Number of Function Evaluation (NFE). Recent studies have shown that diffusion models suffer from mode-collapse issues on imbalanced data. In order to overcome the limitations of Brownian motion, we introduce a novel score-based generative model referred to as Lévy-Itō Model (LIM). This model utilizes isotropic $\\alpha$-stable Lévy processes. We first derive an exact reverse-time stochastic differential equation driven by the Lévy process and develop the corresponding fractional denoising score matching. The proposed generative model takes advantage of the heavy-tailed properties of the Lévy process. Our experimental results show LIM allows for faster and more diverse sampling while maintaining high fidelity compared to existing diffusion models across various image datasets such as CIFAR10, CelebA, and imbalanced dataset CIFAR10LT. Comparing our results to those of DDPM with 3.21 Fréchet Inception Distance (FID) and 0.6437 Recall on the CelebA dataset, we achieve 1.58 FID and 0.7006 Recall using the same architecture.

    "volume": "spotlight",
    "abstract": "Imitation learning methods seek to learn from an expert either through behavioral cloning (BC) for the policy or inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) for the reward. Such methods enable agents to learn complex tasks from humans that are difficult to capture with hand-designed reward functions. Choosing between BC or IRL for imitation depends on the quality and state-action coverage of the demonstrations, as well as additional access to the Markov decision process. Hybrid strategies that combine BC and IRL are rare, as initial policy optimization against inaccurate rewards diminishes the benefit of pretraining the policy with BC. Our work derives an imitation method that captures the strengths of both BC and IRL. In the entropy-regularized (`soft') reinforcement learning setting, we show that the behavioral-cloned policy can be used as both a shaped reward and a critic hypothesis space by inverting the regularized policy update. This coherency facilitates fine-tuning cloned policies using the reward estimate and additional interactions with the environment. This approach conveniently achieves imitation learning through initial behavioral cloning and subsequent refinement via RL with online or offline data sources. The simplicity of the approach enables graceful scaling to high-dimensional and vision-based tasks, with stable learning and minimal hyperparameter tuning, in contrast to adversarial approaches.

We show that the proposed optimization objective is strikingly well-correlated with the ground truth labeling of the dataset. In effect, we only train linear classifiers on top of pretrained representations that remain fixed during training, making our framework compatible with any large pretrained and self-supervised model. Despite its simplicity, HUME outperforms a supervised linear classifier on top of self-supervised representations on the STL-10 dataset by a large margin and achieves comparable performance on the CIFAR-10 dataset.

Through clever reuse of intermediate information, backpropagation facilitates training through gradient computation at a total cost roughly proportional to running the function, rather than incurring an additional factor proportional to the number of parameters -- which can now be in the trillions. Naively, one expects that quantum measurement collapse entirely rules out the reuse of quantum information as in backpropagation. But recent developments in shadow tomography, which assumes access to multiple copies of a quantum state, have challenged that notion. Here, we investigate whether parameterized quantum models can train as efficiently as classical neural networks. We show that achieving backpropagation scaling is impossible without access to multiple copies of a state. With this added ability, we introduce an algorithm with foundations in shadow tomography that matches backpropagation scaling in quantum resources while reducing classical auxiliary computational costs to open problems in shadow tomography. These results highlight the nuance of reusing quantum information for practical purposes and clarify the unique difficulties in training large quantum models, which could alter the course of quantum machine learning",

Although the selection of the latent space is empirically pivotal, determining the optimal choice and the process of identifying it remain unclear. In this study, we aim to shed light on this under-explored topic by rethinking the latent space from the perspective of model complexity. Our investigation starts with the classic generative adversarial networks (GANs). Inspired by the GAN training objective, we propose a novel \"distance\" between the latent and data distributions, whose minimization coincides with that of the generator complexity. The minimizer of this distance is characterized as the optimal data-dependent latent that most effectively capitalizes on the generator's capacity. Then, we consider parameterizing such a latent distribution by an encoder network and propose a two-stage training strategy called Decoupled Autoencoder (DAE), where the encoder is only updated in the first stage with an auxiliary decoder and then frozen in the second stage while the actual decoder is being trained. DAE can improve the latent distribution and as a result, improve the generative performance.

In distinction to existing rewiring approaches that rely on pruning or dynamic routing, which may limit network capacity and plasticity, this work presents a novel rewiring scheme by permuting hidden neurons. Specifically, the neuron permutation is parameterized to be end-to-end learnable and can rearrange all available synapses to explore a large span of weight space, thereby promoting adaptivity. In addition, we introduce two main designs to steer the rewiring process in continual reinforcement learning: first, a multi-mode rewiring strategy is proposed which diversifies the policy and encourages exploration when encountering new environments. Secondly, to ensure stability on history tasks, the network is devised to cache each learned wiring while subtly updating its weights, allowing for retrospective recovery of any previous state appropriate for the task. Meanwhile, an alignment mechanism is curated to achieve better plasticity-stability tradeoff by jointly optimizing cached wirings and weights. Our proposed method is comprehensively evaluated on 18 continual reinforcement learning scenarios ranging from locomotion to manipulation, demonstrating its advantages over state-of-the-art competitors in performance-efficiency tradeoffs.

In this paper, we consider an entropic version of mOT with a tree-structured quadratic cost, i.e., a function that can be written as a sum of pairwise cost functions between the nodes of a tree. To address this problem, we develop Tree-based Diffusion Schr\\\"odinger Bridge (TreeDSB), an extension of the Diffusion Schr\\\"odinger Bridge (DSB) algorithm. TreeDSB corresponds to a dynamic and continuous state-space counterpart of the multimarginal Sinkhorn algorithm. A notable use case of our methodology is to compute Wasserstein barycenters which can be recast as the solution of a mOT problem on a star-shaped tree.

DPT operates in three stages: training a classifier on partially labeled data to predict pseudo-labels; training a conditional generative model using these pseudo-labels to generate pseudo images; and retraining the classifier with a mix of real and pseudo images. Empirically, DPT consistently achieves SOTA performance of semi-supervised generation and classification across various settings. In particular, with one or two labels per class, DPT achieves a Fréchet Inception Distance (FID) score of 3.08 or 2.52 on ImageNet $256\\times256$. Besides, DPT outperforms competitive semi-supervised baselines substantially on ImageNet classification tasks, *achieving top-1 accuracies of 59.0 (+2.8), 69.5 (+3.0), and 74.4 (+2.0)* with one, two, or five labels per class, respectively.

For groups of positive dimension, the gain is observed by a reduction in the manifold's dimension, in addition to a factor proportional to the volume of the quotient space.

To improve online learning efficiency in these applications, we study a novel contextual bandit problem with post-serving contexts and design a new algorithm, poLinUCB, that achieves tight regret under standard assumptions.

We address these bottlenecks with AlpacaFarm, a simulator that enables research and development for learning from feedback at a low cost. First, we design LLM based simulator for human feedback that is 45x cheaper than crowdworkers and displays high agreement with humans. Second, we identify an evaluation dataset representative of real-world instructions and propose an automatic evaluation procedure. Third, we contribute reference implementations for several methods (PPO, best-of-n, expert iteration, among others) that learn from pairwise feedback.

Despite the promising results achieved, the time efficiency of prior approaches is still far from satisfactory. Moreover, when different sizes of synthetic datasets are required, they have to repeat the iterative training procedures, which is highly cumbersome and lacks flexibility. In this paper, different from the time-consuming forward-backward passes, we introduce a generative fashion for dataset distillation with significantly improved efficiency. Specifically, synthetic samples are produced by a generator network conditioned on the initialization of DD, while synthetic labels are obtained by solving a least-squares problem in a feature space. Our theoretical analysis reveals that the errors of synthetic datasets solved in the original space and then processed by any conditional generators are upper-bounded. To find a satisfactory generator efficiently, we propose a meta-learning algorithm, where a meta generator is trained on a large dataset so that only a few steps are required to adapt to a target dataset. The meta generator is termed as MGDD in our approach. Once adapted, it can handle arbitrary sizes of synthetic datasets, even for those unseen during adaptation. Experiments demonstrate that the generator adapted with only a limited number of steps performs on par with those state-of-the-art DD methods and yields $22\\times$ acceleration",

We examine the problem over $504$ pretrained ImageNet models and observe that: 1) Proximity bias exists across a wide variety of model architectures and sizes; 2) Transformer-based models are relatively more susceptible to proximity bias than CNN-based models; 3) Proximity bias persists even after performing popular calibration algorithms like temperature scaling; 4) Models tend to overfit more heavily on low proximity samples than on high proximity samples. Motivated by the empirical findings, we propose ProCal, a plug-and-play algorithm with a theoretical guarantee to adjust sample confidence based on proximity. To further quantify the effectiveness of calibration algorithms in mitigating proximity bias, we introduce proximity-informed expected calibration error (PIECE) with theoretical analysis. We show that ProCal is effective in addressing proximity bias and improving calibration on balanced, long-tail, and distribution-shift settings under four metrics over various model architectures.

These criteria rely on the notion of criticality defined for deep neural networks. In this work we describe a new practical way to diagnose criticality.

We derive and implement a simple and cheap numerical test that allows one to select optimal initialization for a broad class of deep neural networks; containing fully connected, convolutional and normalization layers. Using these tools we show quantitatively that proper stacking of the LayerNorm (applied to preactivations) and residual connections leads to an architecture that is critical for any initialization.

The ability of deep networks to extract salient features is crucial to both their outstanding generalization ability and the modern deep learning paradigm of pretraining and finetuneing. However, this feature learning process remains poorly understood from a theoretical perspective, with existing analyses largely restricted to two-layer networks. In this work we show that three-layer neural networks have provably richer feature learning capabilities than two-layer networks. We analyze the features learned by a three-layer network trained with layer-wise gradient descent, and present a general purpose theorem which upper bounds the sample complexity and width needed to achieve low test error when the target has specific hierarchical structure. We instantiate our framework in specific statistical learning settings -- single-index models and functions of quadratic features -- and show that in the latter setting three-layer networks obtain a sample complexity improvement over all existing guarantees for two-layer networks. Crucially, this sample complexity improvement relies on the ability of three-layer networks to efficiently learn *nonlinear* features. We then establish a concrete optimization-based depth separation by constructing a function which is efficiently learnable via gradient descent on a three-layer network, yet cannot be learned efficiently by a two-layer network. Our work makes progress towards understanding the provable benefit of three-layer neural networks over two-layer networks in the feature learning regime",

    "abstract": "Brain-machine interfaces (BMIs) can restore motor function to people with paralysis but are currently limited by the accuracy of real-time decoding algorithms. Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) using modern training techniques have shown promise in accurately predicting movements from neural signals but have yet to be rigorously evaluated against other decoding algorithms in a closed-loop setting. Here we compared RNNs to other neural network architectures in real-time, continuous decoding of finger movements using intracortical signals from nonhuman primates. Across one and two finger online tasks, LSTMs (a type of RNN) outperformed convolutional and transformer-based neural networks, averaging 18% higher throughput than the convolution network. On simplified tasks with a reduced movement set, RNN decoders were allowed to memorize movement patterns and matched able-bodied control. Performance gradually dropped as the number of distinct movements increased but did not go below fully continuous decoder performance. Finally, in a two-finger task where one degree-of-freedom had poor input signals, we recovered functional control using RNNs trained to act both like a movement classifier and continuous decoder. Our results suggest that RNNs can enable functional real-time BMI control by learning and generating accurate movement patterns",

    "volume": "spotlight",
    "abstract": "We present a novel methodology aimed at optimizing the application of frozen large language models (LLMs) for resource-intensive vision-language (VL) pre-training. The current paradigm uses visual features as prompts to guide language models, with a focus on determining the most relevant visual features for corresponding text. Our approach diverges by concentrating on the language component, specifically identifying the optimal prompts to align with visual features. We introduce the Prompt-Transformer (P-Former), a model that predicts these ideal prompts, which is trained exclusively on linguistic data, bypassing the need for image-text pairings. This strategy subtly bifurcates the end-to-end VL training process into an additional, separate stage. Our experiments reveal that our framework significantly enhances the performance of a robust image-to-text baseline (BLIP-2), and effectively narrows the performance gap between models trained with either 4M or 129M image-text pairs. Importantly, our framework is modality-agnostic and flexible in terms of architectural design, as validated by its successful application in a video learning task using varied base modules.

We introduce quantization with incoherence processing (QuIP), a new method based on the insight that quantization benefits from incoherent weight and Hessian matrices, i.e., from the weights being even in magnitude and the directions in which it is important to round them accurately being unaligned with the coordinate axes. QuIP consists of two steps: (1) an adaptive rounding procedure minimizing a quadratic proxy objective; (2) efficient pre- and post-processing that ensures weight and Hessian incoherence via multiplication by random orthogonal matrices. We complement QuIP with the first theoretical analysis for an LLM-scale quantization algorithm, and show that our theory also applies to an existing method, OPTQ. Empirically, we find that our incoherence preprocessing improves several existing quantization algorithms and yields the first LLM quantization methods that produce viable results using only two bits per weight.

    "abstract": "Diffusion models are powerful generative models but suffer from slow sampling, often taking 1000 sequential denoising steps for one sample. As a result, considerable efforts have been directed toward reducing the number of denoising steps, but these methods hurt sample quality. Instead of reducing the number of denoising steps (trading quality for speed), in this paper we explore an orthogonal approach: can we run the denoising steps in parallel (trading compute for speed)? In spite of the sequential nature of the denoising steps, we show that surprisingly it is possible to parallelize sampling via Picard iterations, by guessing the solution of future denoising steps and iteratively refining until convergence. With this insight, we present ParaDiGMS, a novel method to accelerate the sampling of pretrained diffusion models by denoising multiple steps in parallel. ParaDiGMS is the first diffusion sampling method that enables trading compute for speed and is even compatible with existing fast sampling techniques such as DDIM and DPMSolver. Using ParaDiGMS, we improve sampling speed by 2-4x across a range of robotics and image generation models, giving state-of-the-art sampling speeds of 0.2s on 100-step DiffusionPolicy and 14.6s on 1000-step StableDiffusion-v2 with no measurable degradation of task reward, FID score, or CLIP score",

    "volume": "spotlight",
    "abstract": "Graph condensation, which reduces the size of a large-scale graph by synthesizing a small-scale condensed graph as its substitution, has immediate benefits for various graph learning tasks. However, existing graph condensation methods rely on the joint optimization of nodes and structures in the condensed graph, and overlook critical issues in effectiveness and generalization ability. In this paper, we advocate a new Structure-Free Graph Condensation paradigm, named SFGC, to distill a large-scale graph into a small-scale graph node set without explicit graph structures, i.e., graph-free data. Our idea is to implicitly encode topology structure information into the node attributes in the synthesized graph-free data, whose topology is reduced to an identity matrix. Specifically, SFGC contains two collaborative components: (1) a training trajectory meta-matching scheme for effectively synthesizing small-scale graph-free data; (2) a graph neural feature score metric for dynamically evaluating the quality of the condensed data. Through training trajectory meta-matching, SFGC aligns the long-term GNN learning behaviors between the large-scale graph and the condensed small-scale graph-free data, ensuring comprehensive and compact transfer of informative knowledge to the graph-free data. Afterward, the underlying condensed graph-free data would be dynamically evaluated with the graph neural feature score, which is a closed-form metric for ensuring the excellent expressiveness of the condensed graph-free data. Extensive experiments verify the superiority of SFGC across different condensation ratios",

Our framework can ensure continuous accuracy of gradient estimations and subsequently enhances the rates of identifying second-order stationary points. Additionally, we consider a more challenging task by attempting to locate the global minima of a non-convex objective via the exponential mechanism without almost any assumptions. Our preliminary results suggest that the regularized exponential mechanism can effectively emulate previous empirical and population risk bounds, negating the need for smoothness assumptions for algorithms with polynomial running time. Furthermore, with running time factors excluded, the exponential mechanism demonstrates promising population risk bound performance, and we provide a nearly matching lower bound",

Our model comprises two parallel submodules that are specialized for retrieval (using contrastive learning) and reconstruction (using a diffusion prior). MindEye can map fMRI brain activity to any high dimensional multimodal latent space, like CLIP image space, enabling image reconstruction using generative models that accept embeddings from this latent space. We comprehensively compare our approach with other existing methods, using both qualitative side-by-side comparisons and quantitative evaluations, and show that MindEye achieves state-of-the-art performance in both reconstruction and retrieval tasks. In particular, MindEye can retrieve the exact original image even among highly similar candidates indicating that its brain embeddings retain fine-grained image-specific information. This allows us to accurately retrieve images even from large-scale databases like LAION-5B. We demonstrate through ablations that MindEye's performance improvements over previous methods result from specialized submodules for retrieval and reconstruction, improved training techniques, and training models with orders of magnitude more parameters. Furthermore, we show that MindEye can better preserve low-level image features in the reconstructions by using img2img, with outputs from a separate autoencoder. All code is available on GitHub",

    "title": "Survival Instinct in Offline Reinforcement Learning",
    "volume": "spotlight",
    "abstract": "We present a novel observation about the behavior of offline reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms: on many benchmark datasets, offline RL can produce well-performing and safe policies even when trained with \"wrong\" reward labels, such as those that are zero everywhere or are negatives of the true rewards. This phenomenon cannot be easily explained by offline RL's return maximization objective. Moreover, it gives offline RL a degree of robustness that is uncharacteristic of its online RL counterparts, which are known to be sensitive to reward design. We demonstrate that this surprising robustness property is attributable to an interplay between the notion of *pessimism* in offline RL algorithms and certain implicit biases in common data collection practices. As we prove in this work, pessimism endows the agent with a *survival instinct*, i.e., an incentive to stay within the data support in the long term, while the limited and biased data coverage further constrains the set of survival policies. Formally, given a reward class -- which may not even contain the true reward -- we identify conditions on the training data distribution that enable offline RL to learn a near-optimal and safe policy from any reward within the class. We argue that the survival instinct should be taken into account when interpreting results from existing offline RL benchmarks and when creating future ones. Our empirical and theoretical results suggest a new paradigm for offline RL, whereby an agent is \"nudged\" to learn a desirable behavior with imperfect reward but purposely biased data coverage.

In fact, most memorization criteria strongly correlate with the number of occurrences in the training set, capturing memorized familiar phrases, public knowledge, templated texts, or other repeated data. We formulate a notion of counterfactual memorization which characterizes how a model's predictions change if a particular document is omitted during training. We identify and study counterfactually-memorized training examples in standard text datasets.

In this paper, we investigate the use of stochastic evolution equations in Hilbert spaces, which expand the applicability of SDEs in two aspects: sample space and evolution operator, so they enable encompassing recent variations of diffusion models, such as generating functional data or replacing drift coefficients with image transformation. To this end, we derive a generalized time-reversal formula to build a bridge between probabilistic diffusion models and stochastic evolution equations and propose a score-based generative model called Hilbert Diffusion Model (HDM). Combining with Fourier neural operator, we verify the superiority of HDM for sampling functions from functional datasets with a power of kernel two-sample test of 4.2 on Quadratic, 0.2 on Melbourne, and 3.6 on Gridwatch, which outperforms existing diffusion models formulated in function spaces. Furthermore, the proposed method shows its strength in motion synthesis tasks by utilizing the Wiener process with values in Hilbert space.

Given an entity in the graph, CF-GNN produces a prediction set/interval that provably contains the true label with pre-defined coverage probability (e.g. 90%). We establish a permutation invariance condition that enables the validity of CP on graph data and provide an exact characterization of the test-time coverage. Moreover, besides valid coverage, it is crucial to reduce the prediction set size/interval length for practical use. We observe a key connection between non-conformity scores and network structures, which motivates us to develop a topology-aware output correction model that learns to update the prediction and produces more efficient prediction sets/intervals.

This paper introduces plasticity injection, a minimalistic intervention that increases the network plasticity without changing the number of trainable parameters or biasing the predictions. The applications of this intervention are two-fold: first, as a diagnostic tool — if injection increases the performance, we may conclude that an agent's network was losing its plasticity. This tool allows us to identify a subset of Atari environments where the lack of plasticity causes performance plateaus, motivating future studies on understanding and combating plasticity loss. Second, plasticity injection can be used to improve the computational efficiency of RL training if the agent has to re-learn from scratch due to exhausted plasticity or by growing the agent's network dynamically without compromising performance. The results on Atari show that plasticity injection attains stronger performance compared to alternative methods while being computationally efficient",

However, the neural mechanisms underlying these computations are unclear. We combine a goal-driven modeling approach with dense neurophysiological data and high-throughput human behavioral readouts that contain thousands of comparisons to directly impinge on this question. Specifically, we construct and evaluate several classes of sensory-cognitive networks to predict the future state of rich, ethologically-relevant environments, ranging from self-supervised end-to-end models with pixel-wise or object-slot objectives, to models that future predict in the latent space of purely static image-pretrained or dynamic video-pretrained foundation models. We find that ``scale is \\emph{not} all you need'', and that many state-of-the-art machine learning models fail to perform well on our neural and behavioral benchmarks for future prediction. In fact, only one class of models matches these data well overall. We find that neural responses are currently best predicted by models trained to predict the future state of their environment in the \\emph{latent} space of pretrained foundation models optimized for \\emph{dynamic} scenes in a self-supervised manner. These models also approach the neurons' ability to predict the environmental state variables that are visually hidden from view, despite not being explicitly trained to do so. Finally, we find that not all foundation model latents are equal. Notably, models that future predict in the latent space of video foundation models that are optimized to support a \\emph{diverse} range of egocentric sensorimotor tasks, reasonably match \\emph{both} human behavioral error patterns and neural dynamics across all environmental scenarios that we were able to test. Overall, these findings suggest that the neural mechanisms and behaviors of primate mental simulation have strong inductive biases associated with them, and are thus far most consistent with being optimized to future predict on \\emph{reusable} visual representations that are useful for Embodied AI more generally",

However, a theoretical understanding of their success in practice is still a mystery. Moreover, recent advances on fast convergence in games are limited to no-regret algorithms such as online mirror descent, which satisfy stability. In this paper, we first give counterexamples showing that RM+ and its predictive version can be unstable, which might cause other players to suffer large regret. We then provide two fixes: restarting and chopping off the positive orthant that RM$^+$ works in. We show that these fixes are sufficient to get $O(T^{1/4})$ individual regret and $O(1)$ social regret in normal-form games via RM$^+$ with predictions. We also apply our stabilizing techniques to clairvoyant updates in the uncoupled learning setting for RM$^+$ and prove desirable results akin to recent works for Clairvoyant online mirror descent.

Yet, there remains a gap between the provably injective multiset functions considered in theory, which typically rely on polynomial moments, and the multiset functions used in practice, which rely on $\\textit{neural moments}$ — whose injectivity on multisets has not been studied to date. In this paper, we bridge this gap by showing that moments of neural networks do define injective multiset functions, provided that an analytic non-polynomial activation is used. The number of moments required by our theory is optimal essentially up to a multiplicative factor of two. To prove this result, we state and prove a $\\textit{finite witness theorem}$, which is of independent interest. As a corollary to our main theorem, we derive new approximation results for functions on multisets and measures, and new separation results for graph neural networks.

We show that HyTrel is maximally invariant under certain conditions for tabular data, i.e., two tables obtain the same representations via HyTrel iff the two tables are identical up to permutation. Our empirical results demonstrate that HyTrel consistently outperforms other competitive baselines on four downstream tasks with minimal pretraining, illustrating the advantages of incorporating inductive biases associated with tabular data into the representations.

Although current methods achieve target joint distribution identifiability by enforcing minimal changes across domains, they often necessitate stringent conditions, such as an adequate number of domains, monotonic transformation of latent variables, and invariant label distributions. These requirements are challenging to satisfy in real-world applications. To mitigate the need for these strict assumptions, we propose a subspace identification theory that guarantees the disentanglement of domain-invariant and domain-specific variables under less restrictive constraints regarding domain numbers and transformation properties and thereby facilitating domain adaptation by minimizing the impact of domain shifts on invariant variables. Based on this theory, we develop a Subspace Identification Guarantee (SIG) model that leverages variational inference. Furthermore, the SIG model incorporates class-aware conditional alignment to accommodate target shifts where label distributions change with the domain. Experimental results demonstrate that our SIG model outperforms existing MSDA techniques on various benchmark datasets, highlighting its effectiveness in real-world applications",

    "abstract": "A recent line of empirical studies has demonstrated that SGD might exhibit a heavy-tailed behavior in practical settings, and the heaviness of the tails might correlate with the overall performance. In this paper, we investigate the emergence of such heavy tails. Previous works on this problem only considered, up to our knowledge, online (also called single-pass) SGD, in which the emergence of heavy tails in theoretical findings is contingent upon access to an infinite amount of data. Hence, the underlying mechanism generating the reported heavy-tailed behavior in practical settings, where the amount of training data is finite, is still not well-understood. Our contribution aims to fill this gap. In particular, we show that the stationary distribution of offline (also called multi-pass) SGD exhibits ‘approximate' power-law tails and the approximation error is controlled by how fast the empirical distribution of the training data converges to the true underlying data distribution in the Wasserstein metric. Our main takeaway is that, as the number of data points increases, offline SGD will behave increasingly ‘power-law-like'. To achieve this result, we first prove nonasymptotic Wasserstein convergence bounds for offline SGD to online SGD as the number of data points increases, which can be interesting on their own. Finally, we illustrate our theory on various experiments conducted on synthetic data and neural networks",

The latter can be verified for discrete-time systems via bounded model checking. However, for continuous-time systems, such an approach requires discretization, thereby weakening the guarantees for the original system. This paper presents the first algorithm to directly verify decision-tree controlled system in continuous time. The key aspect of our method is exploiting the decision-tree structure to propagate a set-based approximation through the decision nodes. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by verifying safety of several decision trees distilled to imitate neural-network policies for nonlinear systems",

Then we use reinforcement learning to explore better prompts. We define a reward function that encourages the policy to generate more aesthetically pleasing images while preserving the original user intentions.

Meanwhile, in-context learning is still largely unexplored in the 3D point cloud domain. Although masked modeling has been successfully applied for in-context learning in 2D vision, directly extending it to 3D point clouds remains a formidable challenge. In the case of point clouds, the tokens themselves are the point cloud positions (coordinates) that are masked during inference. Moreover, position embedding in previous works may inadvertently introduce information leakage. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel framework, named Point-In-Context, designed especially for in-context learning in 3D point clouds, where both inputs and outputs are modeled as coordinates for each task. Additionally, we propose the Joint Sampling module, carefully designed to work in tandem with the general point sampling operator, effectively resolving the aforementioned technical issues.

This paper addresses the problem of generalized fMRI-to-image reconstruction by explicitly alleviates the semantic gap. Specifically, we leverage the pre-trained CLIP model to map the training data to a compact feature representation, which essentially extends the sparse semantics of training data to dense ones, thus alleviating the semantic gap of the instances nearby known concepts (i.e., inside the training super-classes). Inspired by the robust low-level representation in fMRI data, which could help alleviate the semantic gap for instances that far from the known concepts (i.e., outside the training super-classes), we leverage structural information as a general cue to guide image reconstruction. Further, we quantify the semantic uncertainty based on probability density estimation and achieve Generalized fMRI-to-image reconstruction by adaptively integrating Expanded Semantics and Structural information (GESS) within a diffusion process. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed GESS model outperforms state-of-the-art methods, and we propose a generalized scenario split strategy to evaluate the advantage of GESS in closing the semantic gap",

Together, these transformations may be viewed as an adaptive form of statistical whitening. Existing mechanistic models of adaptive whitening exclusively use either synaptic plasticity or gain modulation as the biological substrate for adaptation; however, on their own, each of these models has significant limitations. In this work, we unify these approaches in a normative multi-timescale mechanistic model that adaptively whitens its responses with complementary computational roles for synaptic plasticity and gain modulation. Gains are modified on a fast timescale to adapt to the current statistical context, whereas synapses are modified on a slow timescale to match structural properties of the input statistics that are invariant across contexts. Our model is derived from a novel multi-timescale whitening objective that factorizes the inverse whitening matrix into basis vectors, which correspond to synaptic weights, and a diagonal matrix, which corresponds to neuronal gains. We test our model on synthetic and natural datasets and find that the synapses learn optimal configurations over long timescales that enable adaptive whitening on short timescales using gain modulation",

    "abstract": "Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have recently emerged as promising data-driven PDE solvers showing encouraging results on various PDEs. However, there is a fundamental limitation of training PINNs to solve multi-dimensional PDEs and approximate very complex solution functions. The number of training points (collocation points) required on these challenging PDEs grows substantially, and it is severely limited due to the expensive computational costs and heavy memory overhead. To overcome this limit, we propose a network architecture and training algorithm for PINNs. The proposed method, separable PINN (SPINN), operates on a per-axis basis to decrease the number of network propagations in multi-dimensional PDEs instead of point-wise processing in conventional PINNs. We also propose using forward-mode automatic differentiation to reduce the computational cost of computing PDE residuals, enabling a large number of collocation points ($>10^7$) on a single commodity GPU. The experimental results show significantly reduced computational costs ($62\\times$ in wall-clock time, $1,394\\times$ in FLOPs given the same number of collocation points) in multi-dimensional PDEs while achieving better accuracy. Furthermore, we present that SPINN can solve a chaotic (2+1)-d Navier-Stokes equation much faster than the best-performing prior method (9 minutes vs. 10 hours in a single GPU), maintaining accuracy. Finally, we showcase that SPINN can accurately obtain the solution of a highly nonlinear and multi-dimensional PDE, a (3+1)-d Navier-Stokes equation.

We begin by considering offline sparse parity learning, a supervised classification problem which admits a statistical query lower bound for gradient-based training of a multilayer perceptron. This lower bound can be interpreted as a *multi-resource tradeoff frontier*: successful learning can only occur if one is sufficiently rich (large model), knowledgeable (large dataset), patient (many training iterations), or lucky (many random guesses). We show, theoretically and experimentally, that sparse initialization and increasing network width yield significant improvements in sample efficiency in this setting. Here, width plays the role of parallel search: it amplifies the probability of finding \"lottery ticket\" neurons, which learn sparse features more sample-efficiently. Finally, we show that the synthetic sparse parity task can be useful as a proxy for real problems requiring axis-aligned feature learning.

Towards making sense of this fundamentally unsolved problem, this work identifies and analyzes the phenomenon of _attention glitches_, in which the Transformer architecture's inductive biases intermittently fail to capture robust reasoning. To isolate the issue, we introduce _flip-flop language modeling_ (FFLM), a parametric family of synthetic benchmarks designed to probe the extrapolative behavior of neural language models. This simple generative task requires a model to copy binary symbols over long-range dependencies, ignoring the tokens in between. We find that Transformer FFLMs suffer from a long tail of sporadic reasoning errors, some of which we can eliminate using various regularization techniques.

To address the problem of insufficient data, we develop Heterogeneous Neural Processes (HNPs) for the episodic multi-task setup. Within the framework of hierarchical Bayes, HNPs effectively capitalize on prior experiences as meta-knowledge and capture task-relatedness among heterogeneous tasks, mitigating data-insufficiency. Meanwhile, transformer-structured inference modules are designed to enable efficient inferences toward meta-knowledge and task-relatedness. In this way, HNPs can learn more powerful functional priors for adapting to novel heterogeneous tasks in each meta-test episode.

    "title": "Extraction and Recovery of Spatio-Temporal Structure in Latent Dynamics Alignment with Diffusion Model",
    "volume": "spotlight",
    "abstract": "In the field of behavior-related brain computation, it is necessary to align raw neural signals against the drastic domain shift among them. A foundational framework within neuroscience research posits that trial-based neural population activities rely on low-dimensional latent dynamics, thus focusing on the latter greatly facilitates the alignment procedure. Despite this field's progress, existing methods ignore the intrinsic spatio-temporal structure during the alignment phase. Hence, their solutions usually lead to poor quality in latent dynamics structures and overall performance. To tackle this problem, we propose an alignment method ERDiff, which leverages the expressivity of the diffusion model to preserve the spatio-temporal structure of latent dynamics. Specifically, the latent dynamics structures of the source domain are first extracted by a diffusion model. Then, under the guidance of this diffusion model, such structures are well-recovered through a maximum likelihood alignment procedure in the target domain. We first demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method on a synthetic dataset. Then, when applied to neural recordings from the non-human primate motor cortex, under both cross-day and inter-subject settings, our method consistently manifests its capability of preserving the spatio-temporal structure of latent dynamics and outperforms existing approaches in alignment goodness-of-fit and neural decoding performance",

    "title": "Generalizing Importance Weighting to A Universal Solver for Distribution Shift Problems",
    "volume": "spotlight",
    "abstract": "Distribution shift (DS) may have two levels: the distribution itself changes, and the support (i.e., the set where the probability density is non-zero) also changes. When considering the support change between the training and test distributions, there can be four cases: (i) they exactly match; (ii) the training support is wider (and thus covers the test support); (iii) the test support is wider; (iv) they partially overlap. Existing methods are good at cases (i) and (ii), while cases (iii) and (iv) are more common nowadays but still under-explored. In this paper, we generalize importance weighting (IW), a golden solver for cases (i) and (ii), to a universal solver for all cases. Specifically, we first investigate why IW might fail in cases (iii) and (iv); based on the findings, we propose generalized IW (GIW) that could handle cases (iii) and (iv) and would reduce to IW in cases (i) and (ii). In GIW, the test support is split into an in-training (IT) part and an out-of-training (OOT) part, and the expected risk is decomposed into a weighted classification term over the IT part and a standard classification term over the OOT part, which guarantees the risk consistency of GIW. Then, the implementation of GIW consists of three components: (a) the split of validation data is carried out by the one-class support vector machine, (b) the first term of the empirical risk can be handled by any IW algorithm given training data and IT validation data, and (c) the second term just involves OOT validation data. Experiments demonstrate that GIW is a universal solver for DS problems, outperforming IW methods in cases (iii) and (iv)",

    "title": "Is Learning in Games Good for the Learners?",
    "volume": "spotlight",
    "abstract": "We consider a number of questions related to tradeoffs between reward and regret in repeated gameplay between two agents. To facilitate this, we introduce a notion of generalized equilibrium which allows for asymmetric regret constraints, and yields polytopes of feasible values for each agent and pair of regret constraints, where we show that any such equilibrium is reachable by a pair of algorithms which maintain their regret guarantees against arbitrary opponents. As a central example, we highlight the case one agent is no-swap and the other's regret is unconstrained. We show that this captures an extension of Stackelberg equilibria with a matching optimal value, and that there exists a wide class of games where a player can significantly increase their utility by deviating from a no-swap-regret algorithm against a no-swap learner (in fact, almost any game without pure Nash equilibria is of this form). Additionally, we make use of generalized equilibria to consider tradeoffs in terms of the opponent's algorithm choice. We give a tight characterization for the maximal reward obtainable against some no-regret learner, yet we also show a class of games in which this is bounded away from the value obtainable against the class of common \"mean-based\" no-regret algorithms. Finally, we consider the question of learning reward-optimal strategies via repeated play with a no-regret agent when the game is initially unknown. Again we show tradeoffs depending on the opponent's learning algorithm: the Stackelberg strategy is learnable in exponential time with any no-regret agent (and in polynomial time with any no-adaptive-regret agent) for any game where it is learnable via queries, and there are games where it is learnable in polynomial time against any no-swap-regret agent but requires exponential time against a mean-based no-regret agent",

Following the reasoning similar to the well established connections between infinitely wide neural networks and Gaussian processes, we show that SNEFYs admit closed form normalising constants in many cases of interest, thereby resulting in flexible yet fully tractable density models.

In addition, SyMat employs a score-based diffusion model to generate atom coordinates of materials, in which a novel symmetry-aware probabilistic model is used in the coordinate diffusion process.

    "abstract": "Diffusion-based image super-resolution (SR) methods are mainly limited by the low inference speed due to the requirements of hundreds or even thousands of sampling steps. Existing acceleration sampling techniques inevitably sacrifice performance to some extent, leading to over-blurry SR results. To address this issue, we propose a novel and efficient diffusion model for SR that significantly reduces the number of diffusion steps, thereby eliminating the need for post-acceleration during inference and its associated performance deterioration. Our method constructs a Markov chain that transfers between the high-resolution image and the low-resolution image by shifting the residual between them, substantially improving the transition efficiency. Additionally, an elaborate noise schedule is developed to flexibly control the shifting speed and the noise strength during the diffusion process. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method obtains superior or at least comparable performance to current state-of-the-art methods on both synthetic and real-world datasets, \\textit{\\textbf{even only with 20 sampling steps}}.

    "abstract": "Tensor rematerialization allows the training of deep neural networks (DNNs) under limited memory budgets by checkpointing the models and recomputing the evicted tensors as needed. However, the existing tensor rematerialization techniques overlook the memory system in deep learning frameworks and implicitly assume that free memory blocks at different addresses are identical. Under this flawed assumption, discontiguous tensors are evicted, among which some are not used to allocate the new tensor. This leads to severe memory fragmentation and increases the cost of potential rematerializations. To address this issue, we propose to evict tensors within a sliding window to ensure all evictions are contiguous and are immediately used. Furthermore, we proposed cheap tensor partitioning and recomputable in-place to further reduce the rematerialization cost by optimizing the tensor allocation. We named our method \\name/ as it is a co-optimization of tensor allocation and tensor rematerialization. We evaluated \\name/ on eight representative DNNs.

    "volume": "spotlight",
    "abstract": "Out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization is indispensable for learning models in the wild, where testing distribution typically unknown and different from the training. Recent methods derived from causality have shown great potential in achieving OOD generalization. However, existing methods mainly focus on the invariance property of causes, while largely overlooking the property of sufficiency and necessity conditions. Namely, a necessary but insufficient cause (feature) is invariant to distribution shift, yet it may not have required accuracy. By contrast, a sufficient yet unnecessary cause (feature) tends to fit specific data well but may have a risk of adapting to a new domain. To capture the information of sufficient and necessary causes, we employ a classical concept, the probability of sufficiency and necessary causes (PNS), which indicates the probability of whether one is the necessary and sufficient cause. To associate PNS with OOD generalization, we propose PNS risk and formulate an algorithm to learn representation with a high PNS value. We theoretically analyze and prove the generalizability of the PNS risk. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

These metrics compare images in terms of their low-level colors and textures, but fail to capture mid-level similarities and differences in image layout, object pose, and semantic content. In this paper, we develop a perceptual metric that assesses images holistically. Our first step is to collect a new dataset of human similarity judgments over image pairs that are alike in diverse ways. Critical to this dataset is that judgments are nearly automatic and shared by all observers. To achieve this we use recent text-to-image models to create synthetic pairs that are perturbed along various dimensions. We observe that popular perceptual metrics fall short of explaining our new data, and we introduce a new metric, DreamSim, tuned to better align with human perception. We analyze how our metric is affected by different visual attributes, and find that it focuses heavily on foreground objects and semantic content while also being sensitive to color and layout. Notably, despite being trained on synthetic data, our metric generalizes to real images, giving strong results on retrieval and reconstruction tasks. Furthermore, our metric outperforms both prior learned metrics and recent large vision models on these tasks. Our project page: https://dreamsim-nights.github.io/",

    "abstract": "Domain adaptation aims to transfer the knowledge learned on (data-rich) source domains to (low-resource) target domains, and a popular method is invariant representation learning, which matches and aligns the data distributions on the feature space. Although this method is studied extensively and applied on classification and regression problems, its adoption on ranking problems is sporadic, and the few existing implementations lack theoretical justifications. This paper revisits invariant representation learning for ranking. Upon reviewing prior work, we found that they implement what we call item-level alignment, which aligns the distributions of the items being ranked from all lists in aggregate but ignores their list structure. However, the list structure should be leveraged, because it is intrinsic to ranking problems where the data and the metrics are defined and computed on lists, not the items by themselves. To close this discrepancy, we propose list-level alignment—learning domain-invariant representations at the higher level of lists. The benefits are twofold: it leads to the first domain adaptation generalization bound for ranking, in turn providing theoretical support for the proposed method, and it achieves better empirical transfer performance for unsupervised domain adaptation on ranking tasks, including passage reranking",

This paper studies the convergence and implicit bias of constant-stepsize GD for logistic regression on linearly separable data in the EoS regime. Despite the presence of local oscillations, we prove that the logistic loss can be minimized by GD with any constant stepsize over a long time scale. Furthermore, we prove that with any constant stepsize, the GD iterates tend to infinity when projected to a max-margin direction (the hard-margin SVM direction) and converge to a fixed vector that minimizes a strongly convex potential when projected to the orthogonal complement of the max-margin direction. In contrast, we also show that in the EoS regime, GD iterates may diverge catastrophically under the exponential loss, highlighting the superiority of the logistic loss. These theoretical findings are in line with numerical simulations and complement existing theories on the convergence and implicit bias of GD for logistic regression, which are only applicable when the stepsizes are sufficiently small",

The signals of the experts and the outcome of the event follow a joint distribution that is unknown to the principal, but the principal has access to i.i.d. \"samples\" from the distribution, where each sample is a tuple of the experts' reports (not signals) and the realization of the event. Using these samples, the principal aims to find an $\\varepsilon$-approximately optimal aggregator, where optimality is measured in terms of the expected squared distance between the aggregated prediction and the realization of the event. We show that the sample complexity of this problem is at least $\\tilde \\Omega(m^{n-2} / \\varepsilon)$ for arbitrary discrete distributions, where $m$ is the size of each expert's signal space. This sample complexity grows exponentially in the number of experts $n$. But, if the experts' signals are independent conditioned on the realization of the event, then the sample complexity is significantly reduced, to $\\tilde O(1 / \\varepsilon^2)$, which does not depend on $n$.

Once trained, our _Transducer_ can almost instantaneously capture new functional relationships and produce original image estimates, given a few pairs of input and output examples.

In this work, we propose to model the 3D parameter as a random variable instead of a constant as in SDS and present *variational score distillation* (VSD), a principled particle-based variational framework to explain and address the aforementioned issues in text-to-3D generation. We show that SDS is a special case of VSD and leads to poor samples with both small and large CFG weights. In comparison, VSD works well with various CFG weights as ancestral sampling from diffusion models and simultaneously improves the diversity and sample quality with a common CFG weight (i.e., 7.5). We further present various improvements in the design space for text-to-3D such as distillation time schedule and density initialization, which are orthogonal to the distillation algorithm yet not well explored. Our overall approach, dubbed *ProlificDreamer*, can generate high rendering resolution (i.e., 512$\\times$512) and high-fidelity NeRF with rich structure and complex effects (e.g., smoke and drops). Further, initialized from NeRF, meshes fine-tuned by VSD are meticulously detailed and photo-realistic",

    "volume": "spotlight",
    "abstract": "Several studies have compared the in-distribution (ID) and out-of-distribution (OOD) performance of models in computer vision and NLP. They report a frequent positive correlation and some surprisingly never even observe an inverse correlation indicative of a necessary trade-off. The possibility of inverse patterns is important to determine whether ID performance can serve as a proxy for OOD generalization capabilities. This paper shows that inverse correlations between ID and OOD performance do happen with multiple real-world datasets, not only in artificial worst-case settings. We explain theoretically how these cases arise and how past studies missed them because of improper methodologies that examined a biased selection of models. Our observations lead to recommendations that contradict those found in much of the current literature. - High OOD performance sometimes requires trading off ID performance. - Focusing on ID performance alone may not lead to optimal OOD performance. It may produce diminishing (eventually negative) returns in OOD performance. - In these cases, studies on OOD generalization that use ID performance for model selection (a common recommended practice) will necessarily miss the best-performing models, making these studies blind to a whole range of phenomena",

In this paper, we design Markov decision processes (MDPs) for different combinatorial problems and propose to train conditional GFlowNets to sample from the solution space. Efficient training techniques are also developed to benefit long-range credit assignment.

    "title": "Mitigating the Popularity Bias of Graph Collaborative Filtering: A Dimensional Collapse Perspective",
    "volume": "spotlight",
    "abstract": "Graph-based Collaborative Filtering (GCF) is widely used in personalized recommendation systems. However, GCF suffers from a fundamental problem where features tend to occupy the embedding space inefficiently (by spanning only a low-dimensional subspace). Such an effect is characterized in GCF by the embedding space being dominated by a few of popular items with the user embeddings highly concentrated around them. This enhances the so-called Matthew effect of the popularity bias where popular items are highly recommend whereas remaining items are ignored. In this paper, we analyze the above effect in GCF and reveal that the simplified graph convolution operation (typically used in GCF) shrinks the singular space of the feature matrix. As typical approaches (i.e., optimizing the uniformity term) fail to prevent the embedding space degradation, we propose a decorrelation-enhanced GCF objective that promotes feature diversity by leveraging the so-called principle of redundancy reduction in embeddings. However, unlike conventional methods that use the Euclidean geometry to relax hard constraints for decorrelation, we exploit non-Euclidean geometry. Such a choice helps maintain the range space of the matrix and obtain small condition number, which prevents the embedding space degradation. Our method outperforms contrastive-based GCF models on several benchmark datasets and improves the performance for unpopular items",

Existing works on multi item auction scenarios can be roughly divided into RegretNet-like and affine maximizer auctions (AMAs) approaches. However, the former cannot strictly ensure dominant strategy incentive compatibility (DSIC), while the latter faces scalability issue due to the large number of allocation candidates. To address these limitations, we propose AMenuNet, a scalable neural network that constructs the AMA parameters (even including the allocation menu) from bidder and item representations. AMenuNet is always DSIC and individually rational (IR) due to the properties of AMAs, and it enhances scalability by generating candidate allocations through a neural network. Additionally, AMenuNet is permutation equivariant, and its number of parameters is independent of auction scale. We conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate that AMenuNet outperforms strong baselines in both contextual and non-contextual multi-item auctions, scales well to larger auctions, generalizes well to different settings, and identifies useful deterministic allocations. Overall, our proposed approach offers an effective solution to automated DSIC auction design, with improved scalability and strong revenue performance in various settings",

    "volume": "spotlight",
    "abstract": "In the past few years, there has been an explosive surge in the use of machine learning (ML) techniques to address combinatorial optimization (CO) problems, especially mixed-integer linear programs (MILPs). Despite the achievements, the limited availability of real-world instances often leads to sub-optimal decisions and biased solver assessments, which motivates a suite of synthetic MILP instance generation techniques. However, existing methods either rely heavily on expert-designed formulations or struggle to capture the rich features of real-world instances. To tackle this problem, we propose G2MILP, *the first* deep generative framework for MILP instances. Specifically, G2MILP represents MILP instances as bipartite graphs, and applies a masked variational autoencoder to iteratively corrupt and replace parts of the original graphs to generate new ones. The appealing feature of G2MILP is that it can learn to generate novel and realistic MILP instances without prior expert-designed formulations, while preserving the structures and computational hardness of real-world datasets, simultaneously. Thus the generated instances can facilitate downstream tasks for enhancing MILP solvers under limited data availability. We design a suite of benchmarks to evaluate the quality of the generated MILP instances. Experiments demonstrate that our method can produce instances that closely resemble real-world datasets in terms of both structures and computational hardness.

    "abstract": "Attractor networks require neuronal connections to be highly structured in order to maintain attractor states that represent information, while excitation and inhibition balanced networks (E-INNs) require neuronal connections to be random and sparse to generate irregular neuronal firings. Despite being regarded as canonical models of neural circuits, both types of networks are usually studied in isolation, and it remains unclear how they coexist in the brain, given their very different structural demands. In this study, we investigate the compatibility of continuous attractor neural networks (CANNs) and E-INNs. In line with recent experimental data, we find that a neural circuit can exhibit both the traits of CANNs and E-INNs if the neuronal synapses consist of two sets: one set is strong and fast for irregular firing, and the other set is weak and slow for attractor dynamics. Our results from simulations and theoretical analysis reveal that the network also exhibits enhanced performance compared to the case of using only one set of synapses, with accelerated convergence of attractor states and retained E-I balanced condition for localized input. We also apply the network model to solve a real-world tracking problem and demonstrate that it can track fast-moving objects well. We hope that this study provides insight into how structured neural computations are realized by irregular firings of neurons",

    "volume": "spotlight",
    "abstract": "Stein Variational Gradient Descent (SVGD) is a popular particle-based variational inference algorithm with impressive empirical performance across various domains. Although the population (i.e, infinite-particle) limit dynamics of SVGD is well characterized, its behavior in the finite-particle regime is far less understood. To this end, our work introduces the notion of *virtual particles* to develop novel stochastic approximations of population-limit SVGD dynamics in the space of probability measures, that are exactly realizable using finite particles. As a result, we design two computationally efficient variants of SVGD, namely VP-SVGD and GB-SVGD, with provably fast finite-particle convergence rates. Our algorithms can be viewed as specific random-batch approximations of SVGD, which are computationally more efficient than ordinary SVGD. We show that the $n$ particles output by VP-SVGD and GB-SVGD, run for $T$ steps with batch-size $K$, are at-least as good as i.i.d samples from a distribution whose Kernel Stein Discrepancy to the target is at most $O(\\tfrac{d^{1/3}}{(KT)^{1/6}})$ under standard assumptions. Our results also hold under a mild growth condition on the potential function, which is much weaker than the isoperimetric (e.g. Poincare Inequality) or information-transport conditions (e.g. Talagrand's Inequality $\\mathsf{T}_1$) generally considered in prior works. As a corollary, we analyze the convergence of the empirical measure (of the particles output by VP-SVGD and GB-SVGD) to the target distribution and demonstrate a **double exponential improvement** over the best known finite-particle analysis of SVGD. Beyond this, our results present the **first known oracle complexities for this setting with polynomial dimension dependence**, thereby completely eliminating the curse of dimensionality exhibited by previously known finite-particle rates",

    "abstract": "Generative models capable of precisely capturing nuanced clinical features in medical images hold great promise for facilitating clinical data sharing, enhancing rare disease datasets, and efficiently synthesizing (annotated) medical images at scale. Despite their potential, assessing the quality of synthetic medical images remains a challenge. While modern generative models can synthesize visually-realistic medical images, the clinical plausibility of these images may be called into question. Domain-agnostic scores, such as FID score, precision, and recall, cannot incorporate clinical knowledge and are, therefore, not suitable for assessing clinical sensibility. Additionally, there are numerous unpredictable ways in which generative models may fail to synthesize clinically plausible images, making it challenging to anticipate potential failures and design automated scores for their detection. To address these challenges, this paper introduces a pathologist-in-the-loop framework for generating clinically-plausible synthetic medical images. Our framework comprises three steps: (1) pretraining a conditional diffusion model to generate medical images conditioned on a clinical concept, (2) expert pathologist evaluation of the generated images to assess whether they satisfy clinical desiderata, and (3) training a reward model that predicts human feedback on new samples, which we use to incorporate expert knowledge into the finetuning objective of the diffusion model. Our results show that human feedback significantly improves the quality of synthetic images in terms of fidelity, diversity, utility in downstream applications, and plausibility as evaluated by experts. We also demonstrate that human feedback can teach the model new clinical concepts not annotated in the original training data. Our results demonstrate the value of incorporating human feedback in clinical applications where generative models may struggle to capture extensive domain knowledge from raw data alone",

One mainstream paradigm is masked modeling, which successfully pre-trains deep models by learning to reconstruct the masked content based on the unmasked part. However, since the semantic information of time series is mainly contained in temporal variations, the standard way of randomly masking a portion of time points will seriously ruin vital temporal variations of time series, making the reconstruction task too difficult to guide representation learning. We thus present SimMTM, a Simple pre-training framework for Masked Time-series Modeling. By relating masked modeling to manifold learning, SimMTM proposes to recover masked time points by the weighted aggregation of multiple neighbors outside the manifold, which eases the reconstruction task by assembling ruined but complementary temporal variations from multiple masked series. SimMTM further learns to uncover the local structure of the manifold, which is helpful for masked modeling.

Driven by deep learning, recent NR-VQA models based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Transformers have achieved outstanding performance. To build a reliable and practical assessment system, it is of great necessity to evaluate their robustness. However, such issue has received little attention in the academic community. In this paper, we make the first attempt to evaluate the robustness of NR-VQA models against adversarial attacks, and propose a patch-based random search method for black-box attack. Specifically, considering both the attack effect on quality score and the visual quality of adversarial video, the attack problem is formulated as misleading the estimated quality score under the constraint of just-noticeable difference (JND). Built upon such formulation, a novel loss function called Score-Reversed Boundary Loss is designed to push the adversarial video's estimated quality score far away from its ground-truth score towards a specific boundary, and the JND constraint is modeled as a strict $L_2$ and $L_\\infty$ norm restriction. By this means, both white-box and black-box attacks can be launched in an effective and imperceptible manner. The source code is available at https://github.com/GZHU-DVL/AttackVQA",

We prove that running gradient descent on $p$, or equivalently $W$, converges in direction to a max-margin solution that separates *locally-optimal* tokens from non-optimal ones. This clearly formalizes attention as an optimal token selection mechanism. Remarkably, our results are applicable to general data and precisely characterize *optimality* of tokens in terms of the value embeddings $Xv$ and problem geometry. We also provide a broader regularization path analysis that establishes the margin maximizing nature of attention even for nonlinear prediction heads. When optimizing $v$ and $p$ simultaneously with logistic loss, we identify conditions under which the regularization paths directionally converge to their respective hard-margin SVM solutions where $v$ separates the input features based on their labels. Interestingly, the SVM formulation of $p$ is influenced by the support vector geometry of $v$. Finally, we verify our theoretical findings via numerical experiments and provide insights",

Although the main objective when choosing a good paper assignment is to maximize the expertise of each reviewer for their assigned papers, several other considerations make introducing randomization into the paper assignment desirable: robustness to malicious behavior, the ability to evaluate alternative paper assignments, reviewer diversity, and reviewer anonymity. However, it is unclear in what way one should randomize the paper assignment in order to best satisfy all of these considerations simultaneously. In this work, we present a practical, one-size-fits-all method for randomized paper assignment intended to perform well across different motivations for randomness. We show theoretically and experimentally that our method outperforms currently-deployed methods for randomized paper assignment on several intuitive randomness metrics, demonstrating that the randomized assignments produced by our method are general-purpose",

    "title": "ZoomTrack: Target-aware Non-uniform Resizing for Efficient Visual Tracking",
    "volume": "spotlight",
    "abstract": "Recently, the transformer has enabled the speed-oriented trackers to approach state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance with high-speed thanks to the smaller input size or the lighter feature extraction backbone, though they still substantially lag behind their corresponding performance-oriented versions. In this paper, we demonstrate that it is possible to narrow or even close this gap while achieving high tracking speed based on the smaller input size. To this end, we non-uniformly resize the cropped image to have a smaller input size while the resolution of the area where the target is more likely to appear is higher and vice versa. This enables us to solve the dilemma of attending to a larger visual field while retaining more raw information for the target despite a smaller input size. Our formulation for the non-uniform resizing can be efficiently solved through quadratic programming (QP) and naturally integrated into most of the crop-based local trackers. Comprehensive experiments on five challenging datasets based on two kinds of transformer trackers, \\ie, OSTrack and TransT, demonstrate consistent improvements over them. In particular, applying our method to the speed-oriented version of OSTrack even outperforms its performance-oriented counterpart by 0.6\\% AUC on TNL2K, while running 50\\% faster and saving over 55\\% MACs.

    "abstract": "An accurate environment dynamics model is crucial for various downstream tasks, such as counterfactual prediction, off-policy evaluation, and offline reinforcement learning. Currently, these models were learned through empirical risk minimization (ERM) by step-wise fitting of historical transition data. However, we first show that, particularly in the sequential decision-making setting, this approach may catastrophically fail to predict counterfactual action effects due to the selection bias of behavior policies during data collection. To tackle this problem, we introduce a novel model-learning objective called adversarial weighted empirical risk minimization (AWRM). AWRM incorporates an adversarial policy that exploits the model to generate a data distribution that weakens the model's prediction accuracy, and subsequently, the model is learned under this adversarial data distribution. We implement a practical algorithm, GALILEO, for AWRM and evaluate it on two synthetic tasks, three continuous-control tasks, and \\textit{a real-world application}. The experiments demonstrate that GALILEO can accurately predict counterfactual actions and improve various downstream tasks, including offline policy evaluation and improvement, as well as online decision-making",

(2018). We establish tight upper and lower (population) risk bounds for gradient descent in this setting, for any smooth loss function, expressed in terms of its tail decay rate. Our bounds take the form $\\Theta(r_{\\ell,T}^2 / \\gamma^2 T + r_{\\ell,T}^2 / \\gamma^2 n)$, where $T$ is the number of gradient steps, $n$ is size of the training set, $\\gamma$ is the data margin, and $r_{\\ell,T}$ is a complexity term that depends on the tail decay rate of the loss function (and on $T$). Our upper bound greatly improves the existing risk bounds due to Shamir (2021) and Schliserman and Koren (2022), that either applied to specific loss functions or imposed extraneous technical assumptions, and applies to virtually any convex and smooth loss function. Our risk lower bound is the first in this context and establish the tightness of our general upper bound for any given tail decay rate and in all parameter regimes. The proof technique used to show these results is also markedly simpler compared to previous work, and is straightforward to extend to other gradient methods; we illustrate this by providing analogous results for Stochastic Gradient Descent",

    "abstract": "Figuring out which Pre-Trained Model (PTM) from a model zoo fits the target task is essential to take advantage of plentiful model resources. With the availability of numerous heterogeneous PTMs from diverse fields, efficiently selecting the most suitable one is challenging due to the time-consuming costs of carrying out forward or backward passes over all PTMs. In this paper, we propose Model Spider, which tokenizes both PTMs and tasks by summarizing their characteristics into vectors to enable efficient PTM selection. By leveraging the approximated performance of PTMs on a separate set of training tasks, Model Spider learns to construct representation and measure the fitness score between a model-task pair via their representation. The ability to rank relevant PTMs higher than others generalizes to new tasks. With the top-ranked PTM candidates, we further learn to enrich task repr. with their PTM-specific semantics to re-rank the PTMs for better selection. Model Spider balances efficiency and selection ability, making PTM selection like a spider preying on a web.

    "abstract": "Self-supervised pre-training methods on proteins have recently gained attention, with most approaches focusing on either protein sequences or structures, neglecting the exploration of their joint distribution, which is crucial for a comprehensive understanding of protein functions by integrating co-evolutionary information and structural characteristics. In this work, inspired by the success of denoising diffusion models in generative tasks, we propose the DiffPreT approach to pre-train a protein encoder by sequence-structure joint diffusion modeling. DiffPreT guides the encoder to recover the native protein sequences and structures from the perturbed ones along the joint diffusion trajectory, which acquires the joint distribution of sequences and structures. Considering the essential protein conformational variations, we enhance DiffPreT by a method called Siamese Diffusion Trajectory Prediction (SiamDiff) to capture the correlation between different conformers of a protein. SiamDiff attains this goal by maximizing the mutual information between representations of diffusion trajectories of structurally-correlated conformers. We study the effectiveness of DiffPreT and SiamDiff on both atom- and residue-level structure-based protein understanding tasks. Experimental results show that the performance of DiffPreT is consistently competitive on all tasks, and SiamDiff achieves new state-of-the-art performance, considering the mean ranks on all tasks.

Simulating our learned approximation to the time-reversed generative process then provides an effective way of sampling data of varying dimensionality by jointly generating state values and dimensions.

    "abstract": "Regularization in modern machine learning is crucial, and it can take various forms in algorithmic design: training set, model family, error function, regularization terms, and optimizations. In particular, the learning rate, which can be interpreted as a temperature-like parameter within the statistical mechanics of learning, plays a crucial role in neural network training. Indeed, many widely adopted training strategies basically just define the decay of the learning rate over time. This process can be interpreted as decreasing a temperature, using either a global learning rate (for the entire model) or a learning rate that varies for each parameter. This paper proposes TempBalance, a straightforward yet effective layer-wise learning rate method. TempBalance is based on Heavy-Tailed Self-Regularization (HT-SR) Theory, an approach which characterizes the implicit self-regularization of different layers in trained models. We demonstrate the efficacy of using HT-SR-motivated metrics to guide the scheduling and balancing of temperature across all network layers during model training, resulting in improved performance during testing. We implement TempBalance on CIFAR10, CIFAR100, SVHN, and TinyImageNet datasets using ResNets, VGGs and WideResNets with various depths and widths. Our results show that TempBalance significantly outperforms ordinary SGD and carefully-tuned spectral norm regularization. We also show that TempBalance outperforms a number of state-of-the-art optimizers and learning rate schedulers",

We then resample a dataset with these domain weights and train a larger, full-sized model. In our experiments, we use DoReMi on a 280M-parameter proxy model to find domain weights for training an 8B-parameter model (30x larger) more efficiently. On The Pile, DoReMi improves perplexity across all domains, even when it downweights a domain. DoReMi improves average few-shot downstream accuracy by 6.5% points over a baseline model trained using The Pile's default domain weights and reaches the baseline accuracy with 2.6x fewer training steps. On the GLaM dataset, DoReMi, which has no knowledge of downstream tasks, even matches the performance of using domain weights tuned on downstream tasks",

However, what knowledge their representations capture is not fully understood, and they have not been thoroughly explored on downstream tasks. We investigate diffusion models by proposing a method for evaluating them as zero-shot classifiers. The key idea is using a diffusion model's ability to denoise a noised image given a text description of a label as a proxy for that label's likelihood. We apply our method to Stable Diffusion and Imagen, using it to probe fine-grained aspects of the models' knowledge and comparing them with CLIP's zero-shot abilities. They perform competitively with CLIP on a wide range of zero-shot image classification datasets. Additionally, they achieve state-of-the-art results on shape/texture bias tests and can successfully perform attribute binding while CLIP cannot. Although generative pre-training is prevalent in NLP, visual foundation models often use other methods such as contrastive learning. Based on our findings, we argue that generative pre-training should be explored as a compelling alternative for vision and vision-language problems",

Based on the observation that dynamic scenes often contain substantial static areas that result in redundancy in storage and computations, MSTH represents a dynamic scene as a weighted combination of a 3D hash encoding and a 4D hash encoding. The weights for the two components are represented by a learnable mask which is guided by an uncertainty-based objective to reflect the spatial and temporal importance of each 3D position. With this design, our method can reduce the hash collision rate by avoiding redundant queries and modifications on static areas, making it feasible to represent a large number of space-time voxels by hash tables with small size.Besides, without the requirements to fit the large numbers of temporally redundant features independently, our method is easier to optimize and converge rapidly with only twenty minutes of training for a 300-frame dynamic scene. We evaluate our method on extensive dynamic scenes. As a result, MSTH obtains consistently better results than previous state-of-the-art methods with only 20 minutes of training time and 130 MB of memory storage",

We resolve these challenges by proposing novel Voronoi loss functions among parameters and establishing the convergence rates of maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) for solving parameter estimation in these models.

    "abstract": "Although we have witnessed great success of pre-trained models in natural language processing (NLP) and computer vision (CV), limited progress has been made for general time series analysis. Unlike NLP and CV where a unified model can be used to perform different tasks, specially designed approach still dominates in each time series analysis task such as classification, anomaly detection, forecasting, and few-shot learning. The main challenge that blocks the development of pre-trained model for time series analysis is the lack of a large amount of data for training. In this work, we address this challenge by leveraging language or CV models, pre-trained from billions of tokens, for time series analysis. Specifically, we refrain from altering the self-attention and feedforward layers of the residual blocks in the pre-trained language or image model. This model, known as the Frozen Pretrained Transformer (FPT), is evaluated through fine-tuning on all major types of tasks involving time series. Our results demonstrate that pre-trained models on natural language or images can lead to a comparable or state-of-the-art performance in all main time series analysis tasks, as illustrated in Figure1. We also found both theoretically and empirically that the self-attention module behaviors similarly to principle component analysis (PCA), an observation that helps explains how transformer bridges the domain gap and a crucial step towards understanding the universality of a pre-trained transformer.

To this end, existing sample- efficient algorithms typically consist of three components: estimation, planning, and exploration.

To address this challenge, we propose an easy-to-implement RL framework called Maximize to Explore (MEX), which only needs to optimize unconstrainedly a single objective that integrates the estimation and planning components while balancing exploration and exploitation automatically. Theoretically, we prove that the MEX achieves a sublinear regret with general function approximators and is extendable to the zero-sum Markov game setting. Meanwhile, we adapt deep RL baselines to design practical versions of MEX in both the model-based and model-free settings, which outperform baselines in various MuJoCo environments with sparse reward by a stable margin.

However, our empirical research reveals that the current strategies fall short of their full potential under the more realistic self-supervised pre-training, which is essential for handling vast quantities of unlabeled data in practice. This is largely due to the difficulty of task-specific knowledge being incorporated into instructed representations via prompt parameters and predicted by uninstructed representations at test time. To overcome the exposed sub-optimality, we conduct a theoretical analysis of the continual learning objective in the context of pre-training, and decompose it into hierarchical components: within-task prediction, task-identity inference, and task-adaptive prediction. Following these empirical and theoretical insights, we propose Hierarchical Decomposition (HiDe-)Prompt, an innovative approach that explicitly optimizes the hierarchical components with an ensemble of task-specific prompts and statistics of both uninstructed and instructed representations, further with the coordination of a contrastive regularization strategy. Our extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of HiDe-Prompt and its robustness to pre-training paradigms in continual learning (e.g., up to 15.01% and 9.61% lead on Split CIFAR-100 and Split ImageNet-R, respectively)",

However, these negative results strongly rely on an adversarial model that significantly advantages the adversarial analyst over the mechanism, as the analyst, who chooses the adaptive queries, also chooses the underlying distribution $\\cal{D}$.

    "abstract": "We study a decentralized multi-agent multi-armed bandit problem in which multiple clients are connected by time dependent random graphs provided by an environment. The reward distributions of each arm vary across clients and rewards are generated independently over time by an environment based on distributions that include both sub-exponential and sub-gaussian distributions. Each client pulls an arm and communicates with neighbors based on the graph provided by the environment. The goal is to minimize the overall regret of the entire system through collaborations. To this end, we introduce a novel algorithmic framework, which first provides robust simulation methods for generating random graphs using rapidly mixing markov chains or the random graph model, and then combines an averaging-based consensus approach with a newly proposed weighting technique and the upper confidence bound to deliver a UCB-type solution. Our algorithms account for the randomness in the graphs, removing the conventional doubly stochasticity assumption, and only require the knowledge of the number of clients at initialization. We derive optimal instance-dependent regret upper bounds of order $\\log{T}$ in both sub-gaussian and sub-exponential environments, and a nearly optimal instance-free regret upper bound of order $\\sqrt{T}\\log T$ up to a $\\log T$ factor. Importantly, our regret bounds hold with high probability and capture graph randomness, whereas prior works consider expected regret under assumptions and require more stringent reward distributions",

    "volume": "spotlight",
    "abstract": "Machine learning (ML) models can underperform on certain population groups due to choices made during model development and bias inherent in the data. We categorize sources of discrimination in the ML pipeline into two classes: aleatoric discrimination, which is inherent in the data distribution, and epistemic discrimination, which is due to decisions made during model development. We quantify aleatoric discrimination by determining the performance limits of a model under fairness constraints, assuming perfect knowledge of the data distribution. We demonstrate how to characterize aleatoric discrimination by applying Blackwell's results on comparing statistical experiments. We then quantify epistemic discrimination as the gap between a model's accuracy when fairness constraints are applied and the limit posed by aleatoric discrimination. We apply this approach to benchmark existing fairness interventions and investigate fairness risks in data with missing values. Our results indicate that state-of-the-art fairness interventions are effective at removing epistemic discrimination on standard (overused) tabular datasets. However, when data has missing values, there is still significant room for improvement in handling aleatoric discrimination",

    "abstract": "State-of-the-art machine learning models can be vulnerable to very small input perturbations that are adversarially constructed. Adversarial training is an effective approach to defend against it. Formulated as a min-max problem, it searches for the best solution when the training data were corrupted by the worst-case attacks. Linear models are among the simple models where vulnerabilities can be observed and are the focus of our study. In this case, adversarial training leads to a convex optimization problem which can be formulated as the minimization of a finite sum. We provide a comparative analysis between the solution of adversarial training in linear regression and other regularization methods. Our main findings are that: (A) Adversarial training yields the minimum-norm interpolating solution in the overparameterized regime (more parameters than data), as long as the maximum disturbance radius is smaller than a threshold. And, conversely, the minimum-norm interpolator is the solution to adversarial training with a given radius. (B) Adversarial training can be equivalent to parameter shrinking methods (ridge regression and Lasso). This happens in the underparametrized region, for an appropriate choice of adversarial radius and zero-mean symmetrically distributed covariates. (C) For $\\ell_\\infty$-adversarial training---as in square-root Lasso---the choice of adversarial radius for optimal bounds does not depend on the additive noise variance.

The core difficulty is sparseness of coupling effect that emerges (the coupling force is significant) only momentarily and otherwise remains quiescent in time series (e.g., neuronal activity sequence). Here we learn the idea from attention mechanism to guide the classifier to make inference focusing on the critical regions of time series data where coupling effect may manifest. Specifically, attention coefficients are assigned autonomously by artificial neural networks trained to maximise the Attentive Transfer Entropy (ATEn), which is a novel generalization of the iconic transfer entropy metric. Our results show that, without any prior knowledge of dynamics, ATEn explicitly identifies areas where the strength of coupling-drive is distinctly greater than zero. This innovation substantially improves reconstruction performance for both synthetic and real directed coupling networks using data generated by neuronal models widely used in neuroscience",

However, such predictive tools are still limited as they occupy one of two extremes, either operating (a) by fragmenting molecules combinatorially with overly rigid constraints on potential rearrangements and poor time complexity or (b) by decoding lossy and nonphysical discretized spectra vectors. In this work, we use a new intermediate strategy for predicting mass spectra from molecules by treating mass spectra as sets of molecular formulae, which are themselves multisets of atoms. After first encoding an input molecular graph, we decode a set of molecular subformulae, each of which specify a predicted peak in the mass spectrum, the intensities of which are predicted by a second model. Our key insight is to overcome the combinatorial possibilities for molecular subformulae by decoding the formula set using a prefix tree structure, atom-type by atom-type, representing a general method for ordered multiset decoding.

Under data heterogeneity however, which is the norm in practical scenarios, established lower bounds on the learning error are essentially vacuous and greatly mismatch empirical observations. This is because the heterogeneity model considered is too restrictive and does not cover basic learning tasks such as least-squares regression. We consider in this paper a more realistic heterogeneity model, namely $(G,B)$-gradient dissimilarity, and show that it covers a larger class of learning problems than existing theory. Notably, we show that the breakdown point under heterogeneity is lower than the classical fraction $\\frac{1}{2}$.

MD is often used to compute equilibrium properties, which requires sampling from an equilibrium distribution such as the Boltzmann distribution. However, many important processes, such as binding and folding, occur over timescales of milliseconds or beyond, and cannot be efficiently sampled with conventional MD. Furthermore, new MD simulations need to be performed for each molecular system studied. We present *Timewarp*, an enhanced sampling method which uses a normalising flow as a proposal distribution in a Markov chain Monte Carlo method targeting the Boltzmann distribution. The flow is trained offline on MD trajectories and learns to make large steps in time, simulating the molecular dynamics of $10^{5} - 10^{6} \\textrm{fs}$. Crucially, Timewarp is *transferable* between molecular systems: once trained, we show that it generalises to unseen small peptides (2-4 amino acids) at all-atom resolution, exploring their metastable states and providing wall-clock acceleration of sampling compared to standard MD. Our method constitutes an important step towards general, transferable algorithms for accelerating MD",

Focusing on locally connected neural networks (a prevalent family of architectures that includes convolutional and recurrent neural networks as well as local self-attention models), we address this problem by adopting theoretical tools from quantum physics. Our main theoretical result states that a certain locally connected neural network is capable of accurate prediction over a data distribution if and only if the data distribution admits low quantum entanglement under certain canonical partitions of features. As a practical application of this result, we derive a preprocessing method for enhancing the suitability of a data distribution to locally connected neural networks.

    "title": "Learning Generalizable Agents via Saliency-guided Features Decorrelation",
    "volume": "spotlight",
    "abstract": "In visual-based Reinforcement Learning (RL), agents often struggle to generalize well to environmental variations in the state space that were not observed during training. The variations can arise in both task-irrelevant features, such as background noise, and task-relevant features, such as robot configurations, that are related to the optimal decisions. To achieve generalization in both situations, agents are required to accurately understand the impact of changed features on the decisions, i.e., establishing the true associations between changed features and decisions in the policy model. However, due to the inherent correlations among features in the state space, the associations between features and decisions become entangled, making it difficult for the policy to distinguish them. To this end, we propose Saliency-Guided Features Decorrelation (SGFD) to eliminate these correlations through sample reweighting. Concretely, SGFD consists of two core techniques: Random Fourier Functions (RFF) and the saliency map. RFF is utilized to estimate the complex non-linear correlations in high-dimensional images, while the saliency map is designed to identify the changed features. Under the guidance of the saliency map, SGFD employs sample reweighting to minimize the estimated correlations related to changed features, thereby achieving decorrelation in visual RL tasks. Our experimental results demonstrate that SGFD can generalize well on a wide range of test environments and significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in handling both task-irrelevant variations and task-relevant variations",

    "abstract": "Neural radiance fields (NeRFs) have become a ubiquitous tool for modeling scene appearance and geometry from multiview imagery. Recent work has also begun to explore how to use additional supervision from lidar or depth sensor measurements in the NeRF framework. However, previous lidar-supervised NeRFs focus on rendering conventional camera imagery and use lidar-derived point cloud data as auxiliary supervision; thus, they fail to incorporate the underlying image formation model of the lidar. Here, we propose a novel method for rendering transient NeRFs that take as input the raw, time-resolved photon count histograms measured by a single-photon lidar system, and we seek to render such histograms from novel views. Different from conventional NeRFs, the approach relies on a time-resolved version of the volume rendering equation to render the lidar measurements and capture transient light transport phenomena at picosecond timescales. We evaluate our method on a first-of-its-kind dataset of simulated and captured transient multiview scans from a prototype single-photon lidar. Overall, our work brings NeRFs to a new dimension of imaging at transient timescales, newly enabling rendering of transient imagery from novel views. Additionally, we show that our approach recovers improved geometry and conventional appearance compared to point cloud-based supervision when training on few input viewpoints. Transient NeRFs may be especially useful for applications which seek to simulate raw lidar measurements for downstream tasks in autonomous driving, robotics, and remote sensing",

Normalization techniques, such as Layer Normalization (LayerNorm, LN) and Root Mean Square Normalization (RMSNorm), play a critical role in accelerating and stabilizing the training of Transformers. While LayerNorm recenters and rescales input vectors, RMSNorm only rescales the vectors by their RMS value. Despite being more computationally efficient, RMSNorm may compromise the representation ability of Transformers. There is currently no consensus regarding the preferred normalization technique, as some models employ LayerNorm while others utilize RMSNorm, especially in recent large language models. It is challenging to convert Transformers with one normalization to the other type. While there is an ongoing disagreement between the two normalization types, we propose a solution to unify two mainstream Transformer architectures, Pre-LN and Pre-RMSNorm Transformers. By removing the inherent redundant mean information in the main branch of Pre-LN Transformers, we can reduce LayerNorm to RMSNorm, achieving higher efficiency. We further propose the Compressed RMSNorm (CRMSNorm) and Pre-CRMSNorm Transformer based on a lossless compression of the zero-mean vectors. We formally establish the equivalence of Pre-LN, Pre-RMSNorm, and Pre-CRMSNorm Transformer variants in both training and inference. It implies that Pre-LN Transformers can be substituted with Pre-(C)RMSNorm counterparts at almost no cost, offering the same arithmetic functionality along with free efficiency improvement.

Toward building and understanding human-like social machines, we are motivated to ask: Can we assess machine behaviors by leveraging human psychometric tests in a **principled** and **quantitative** manner? If so, can we induce a specific personality in LLMs? To answer these questions, we introduce the Machine Personality Inventory (MPI) tool for studying machine behaviors; MPI follows standardized personality tests, built upon the Big Five Personality Factors (Big Five) theory and personality assessment inventories. By systematically evaluating LLMs with MPI, we provide the first piece of evidence demonstrating the efficacy of MPI in studying LLMs behaviors.

This paper builds on the recently developed smoothed online learning framework and provides the first algorithms for prediction and simulation in PWA systems whose regret is polynomial in all relevant problem parameters under a weak smoothness assumption; moreover, our algorithms are efficient in the number of calls to an optimization oracle. We further apply our results to the problems of one-step prediction and multi-step simulation regret in piecewise affine dynamical systems, where the learner is tasked with simulating trajectories and regret is measured in terms of the Wasserstein distance between simulated and true data. Along the way, we develop several technical tools of more general interest",

    "abstract": "Although the mapping between sound and meaning in human language is assumed to be largely arbitrary, research in cognitive science has shown that there are non-trivial correlations between particular sounds and meanings across languages and demographic groups, a phenomenon known as sound symbolism. Among the many dimensions of meaning, sound symbolism is particularly salient and well-demonstrated with regards to cross-modal associations between language and the visual domain. In this work, we address the question of whether sound symbolism is reflected in vision-and-language models such as CLIP and Stable Diffusion. Using zero-shot knowledge probing to investigate the inherent knowledge of these models, we find strong evidence that they do show this pattern, paralleling the well-known kiki-bouba effect in psycholinguistics. Our work provides a novel method for demonstrating sound symbolism and understanding its nature using computational tools. Our code will be made publicly available",

    "abstract": "Vision and Language (VL) models offer an effective method for aligning representation spaces of images and text allowing for numerous applications such as cross-modal retrieval, visual and multi-hop question answering, captioning, and many more. However, the aligned image-text spaces learned by all the popular VL models are still suffering from the so-called 'object bias' - their representations behave as 'bags of nouns' mostly ignoring or downsizing the attributes, relations, and states of objects described/appearing in texts/images. Although some great attempts at fixing these `compositional reasoning' issues were proposed in the recent literature, the problem is still far from being solved. In this paper, we uncover two factors limiting the VL models' compositional reasoning performance. These two factors are properties of the paired VL dataset used for finetuning (or pre-training) the VL model: (i) the caption quality, or in other words 'image-alignment', of the texts; and (ii) the 'density' of the captions in the sense of mentioning all the details appearing on the image. We propose a fine-tuning approach for automatically treating these factors on a standard collection of paired VL data (CC3M). Applied to CLIP, we demonstrate its significant compositional reasoning performance increase of up to $\\sim27$\\% over the base model, up to $\\sim20$\\% over the strongest baseline, and by $6.7$\\% on average.

    "abstract": "This paper introduces MVDiffusion, a simple yet effective multi-view image generation method for scenarios where pixel-to-pixel correspondences are available, such as perspective crops from panorama or multi-view images given geometry (depth maps and poses). Unlike prior methods that rely on iterative image warping and inpainting, MVDiffusion concurrently generates all images with a global awareness, encompassing high resolution and rich content, effectively addressing the error accumulation prevalent in preceding models. MVDiffusion specifically incorporates a correspondence-aware attention mechanism, enabling effective cross-view interaction. This mechanism underpins three pivotal modules: 1) a generation module that produces low-resolution images while maintaining global correspondence, 2) an interpolation module that densifies spatial coverage between images, and 3) a super-resolution module that upscales into high-resolution images. In terms of panoramic imagery, MVDiffusion generates high-resolution photorealistic images up to 1024*1024 pixels. For geometry-conditioned multi-view image generation, MVDiffusion demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on texture-map generation for a given scene mesh.

These methods seek to discover intelligible visual ``concepts'' buried within the complex patterns of ANN activations in two key steps: (1) concept extraction followed by (2) importance estimation. While these two steps are shared across methods, they all differ in their specific implementations. Here, we introduce a unifying theoretical framework that recast the first step -- concept extraction problem -- as a special case of **dictionary learning**, and we formalize the second step -- concept importance estimation -- as a more general form of **attribution method**. This framework offers several advantages as it allows us: (i) to propose new evaluation metrics for comparing different concept extraction approaches; (ii) to leverage modern attribution methods and evaluation metrics to extend and systematically evaluate state-of-the-art concept-based approaches and importance estimation techniques; (iii) to derive theoretical guarantees regarding the optimality of such methods. We further leverage our framework to try to tackle a crucial question in explainability: how to *efficiently* identify clusters of data points that are classified based on a similar shared strategy. To illustrate these findings and to highlight the main strategies of a model, we introduce a visual representation called the strategic cluster graph. Finally, we present Lens, a dedicated website that offers a complete compilation of these visualizations for all classes of the ImageNet dataset",

Extensive experiments conducted on eleven different point cloud datasets showcase the effectiveness and superiority of Seal.

Although image enhancement can be considered as a form of style transformation, there has been little exploration of how normalization affect the enhancement performance. To fully leverage the potential of normalization, we present a novel Transition-Constant Normalization (TCN) for various image enhancement tasks. Specifically, it consists of two streams of normalization operations arranged under an invertible constraint, along with a feature sub-sampling operation that satisfies the normalization constraint. TCN enjoys several merits, including being parameter-free, plug-and-play, and incurring no additional computational costs. We provide various formats to utilize TCN for image enhancement, including seamless integration with enhancement networks, incorporation into encoder-decoder architectures for downsampling, and implementation of efficient architectures. Through extensive experiments on multiple image enhancement tasks, like low-light enhancement, exposure correction, SDR2HDR translation, and image dehazing, our TCN consistently demonstrates performance improvements.

Specifically, the introduction of small perturbations to the text prompts can result in the blending of primary subjects with other categories or their complete disappearance in the generated images. In this paper, we propose **Auto-attack on Text-to-image Models (ATM)**, a gradient-based approach, to effectively and efficiently generate such perturbations. By learning a Gumbel Softmax distribution, we can make the discrete process of word replacement or extension continuous, thus ensuring the differentiability of the perturbation generation. Once the distribution is learned, ATM can sample multiple attack samples simultaneously. These attack samples can prevent the generative model from generating the desired subjects without tampering with the category keywords in the prompt. ATM has achieved a 91.1\\% success rate in short-text attacks and an 81.2\\% success rate in long-text attacks. Further empirical analysis revealed three attack patterns based on: 1) variability in generation speed, 2) similarity of coarse-grained characteristics, and 3) polysemy of words.

Existing methods, however, often under-use the time information and ignore the structural knowledge within the sparsely observed tensor entries. To overcome these limitations and to better capture the underlying temporal structure, we propose Dynamic EMbedIngs fOr dynamic Tensor dEcomposition (DEMOTE). We develop a neural diffusion-reaction process to estimate dynamic embeddings for the entities in each tensor mode. Specifically, based on the observed tensor entries, we build a multi-partite graph to encode the correlation between the entities. We construct a graph diffusion process to co-evolve the embedding trajectories of the correlated entities and use a neural network to construct a reaction process for each individual entity. In this way, our model can capture both the commonalities and personalities during the evolution of the embeddings for different entities. We then use a neural network to model the entry value as a nonlinear function of the embedding trajectories. For model estimation, we combine ODE solvers to develop a stochastic mini-batch learning algorithm. We propose a stratified sampling method to balance the cost of processing each mini-batch so as to improve the overall efficiency.

    "abstract": "Recent diffusion model advancements have enabled high-fidelity images to be generated using text prompts. However, a domain gap exists between generated images and real-world images, which poses a challenge in generating high-quality variations of real-world images. Our investigation uncovers that this domain gap originates from a latents' distribution gap in different diffusion processes. To address this issue, we propose a novel inference pipeline called Real-world Image Variation by ALignment (RIVAL) that utilizes diffusion models to generate image variations from a single image exemplar. Our pipeline enhances the generation quality of image variations by aligning the image generation process to the source image's inversion chain. Specifically, we demonstrate that step-wise latent distribution alignment is essential for generating high-quality variations. To attain this, we design a cross-image self-attention injection for feature interaction and a step-wise distribution normalization to align the latent features. Incorporating these alignment processes into a diffusion model allows RIVAL to generate high-quality image variations without further parameter optimization. Our experimental results demonstrate that our proposed approach outperforms existing methods concerning semantic similarity and perceptual quality. This generalized inference pipeline can be easily applied to other diffusion-based generation tasks, such as image-conditioned text-to-image generation and stylization.

For efficiency, all residue types and structures are updated together in each round (i.e., full-shot refinement). In the first step, the residue types and backbone coordinates are updated with a hierarchical context encoder and two structure refinement modules capturing inter-residue and pocket-ligand interactions. The second step further models the sidechain atoms of pockets and updates residue types to achieve sequence-structure consistency. The structure of the binding ligand is also updated along with the above refinement iterations accounting for its flexibility.

But it can also be problematic since it can induce inconsistencies in, e.g., Hessian-based flatness measures, optimization trajectories, and modes of probability densities. This complicates downstream analyses: e.g. one cannot definitively relate flatness with generalization since arbitrary reparametrization changes their relationship. In this work, we study the invariance of neural nets under reparametrization from the perspective of Riemannian geometry. From this point of view, invariance is an inherent property of any neural net _if_ one explicitly represents the metric and uses the correct associated transformation rules. This is important since although the metric is always present, it is often implicitly assumed as identity, and thus dropped from the notation, then lost under reparametrization.

However, the diffusion model requires a large number of inference iterations to recover the clean image from pure Gaussian noise, which consumes massive computational resources. Moreover, the distribution synthesized by the diffusion model is often misaligned with the target results, leading to restrictions in distortion-based metrics. To address the above issues, we propose the Hierarchical Integration Diffusion Model (HI-Diff), for realistic image deblurring.

The deblurring process is implemented by a regression-based method to obtain better distortion accuracy. Meanwhile, the highly compact latent space ensures the efficiency of the DM.

In this paper, we present Banana, a Banach fixed-point network for equivariant segmentation with inter-part equivariance by construction. Our key insight is to iteratively solve a fixed-point problem, where point-part assignment labels and per-part SE(3)-equivariance co-evolve simultaneously. We provide theoretical derivations of both per-step equivariance and global convergence, which induces an equivariant final convergent state. Our formulation naturally provides a strict definition of inter-part equivariance that generalizes to unseen inter-part configurations.

    "abstract": "Cross-modality registration between 2D images captured by cameras and 3D point clouds from LiDARs is a crucial task in computer vision and robotic. Previous methods estimate 2D-3D correspondences by matching point and pixel patterns learned by neural networks, and use Perspective-n-Points (PnP) to estimate rigid transformation during post-processing. However, these methods struggle to map points and pixels to a shared latent space robustly since points and pixels have very different characteristics with patterns learned in different manners (MLP and CNN), and they also fail to construct supervision directly on the transformation since the PnP is non-differentiable, which leads to unstable registration results. To address these problems, we propose to learn a structured cross-modality latent space to represent pixel features and 3D features via a differentiable probabilistic PnP solver. Specifically, we design a triplet network to learn VoxelPoint-to-Pixel matching, where we represent 3D elements using both voxels and points to learn the cross-modality latent space with pixels. We design both the voxel and pixel branch based on CNNs to operate convolutions on voxels/pixels represented in grids, and integrate an additional point branch to regain the information lost during voxelization. We train our framework end-to-end by imposing supervisions directly on the predicted pose distribution with a probabilistic PnP solver. To explore distinctive patterns of cross-modality features, we design a novel loss with adaptive-weighted optimization for cross-modality feature description.

    "abstract": "Adversarial contrastive learning (ACL) does not require expensive data annotations but outputs a robust representation that withstands adversarial attacks and also generalizes to a wide range of downstream tasks. However, ACL needs tremendous running time to generate the adversarial variants of all training data, which limits its scalability to large datasets. To speed up ACL, this paper proposes a robustness-aware coreset selection (RCS) method. RCS does not require label information and searches for an informative subset that minimizes a representational divergence, which is the distance of the representation between natural data and their virtual adversarial variants. The vanilla solution of RCS via traversing all possible subsets is computationally prohibitive. Therefore, we theoretically transform RCS into a surrogate problem of submodular maximization, of which the greedy search is an efficient solution with an optimality guarantee for the original problem. Empirically, our comprehensive results corroborate that RCS can speed up ACL by a large margin without significantly hurting the robustness transferability. Notably, to the best of our knowledge, we are the first to conduct ACL efficiently on the large-scale ImageNet-1K dataset to obtain an effective robust representation via RCS.

    "title": "Beyond Myopia: Learning from Positive and Unlabeled Data through Holistic Predictive Trends",
    "volume": "spotlight",
    "abstract": "Learning binary classifiers from positive and unlabeled data (PUL) is vital in many real-world applications, especially when verifying negative examples is difficult. Despite the impressive empirical performance of recent PUL methods, challenges like accumulated errors and increased estimation bias persist due to the absence of negative labels. In this paper, we unveil an intriguing yet long-overlooked observation in PUL: \\textit{resampling the positive data in each training iteration to ensure a balanced distribution between positive and unlabeled examples results in strong early-stage performance. Furthermore, predictive trends for positive and negative classes display distinctly different patterns.} Specifically, the scores (output probability) of unlabeled negative examples consistently decrease, while those of unlabeled positive examples show largely chaotic trends. Instead of focusing on classification within individual time frames, we innovatively adopt a holistic approach, interpreting the scores of each example as a temporal point process (TPP). This reformulates the core problem of PUL as recognizing trends in these scores. We then propose a novel TPP-inspired measure for trend detection and prove its asymptotic unbiasedness in predicting changes. Notably, our method accomplishes PUL without requiring additional parameter tuning or prior assumptions, offering an alternative perspective for tackling this problem. Extensive experiments verify the superiority of our method, particularly in a highly imbalanced real-world setting, where it achieves improvements of up to $11.3\\%$ in key metrics",

    "abstract": "We tackle the problem of Persistent Independent Particles (PIPs), also called Tracking Any Point (TAP), in videos, which specifically aims at estimating persistent long-term trajectories of query points in videos. Previous methods attempted to estimate these trajectories independently to incorporate longer image sequences, therefore, ignoring the potential benefits of incorporating spatial context features. We argue that independent video point tracking also demands spatial context features. To this end, we propose a novel framework Context-PIPs, which effectively improves point trajectory accuracy by aggregating spatial context features in videos. Context-PIPs contains two main modules: 1) a SOurse Feature Enhancement (SOFE) module, and 2) a TArget Feature Aggregation (TAFA) module. Context-PIPs significantly improves PIPs all-sided, reducing 11.4\\% Average Trajectory Error of Occluded Points (ATE-Occ) on CroHD and increasing 11.8\\% Average Percentage of Correct Keypoint (A-PCK) on TAP-Vid-Kinectics.

    "volume": "spotlight",
    "abstract": "The generalization capability of machine learning systems degenerates notably when the test distribution drifts from the training distribution. Recently, Domain Generalization (DG) has been gaining momentum in enabling machine learning models to generalize to unseen domains. However, most DG methods assume that training and test data share an identical label space, ignoring the potential unseen categories in many real-world applications. In this paper, we delve into a more general but difficult problem termed Open Test-Time DG (OTDG), where both domain shift and open class may occur on the unseen test data. We propose Compaction and Disambiguation (CODA), a novel two-stage framework for learning compact representations and adapting to open classes in the wild. To meaningfully regularize the model's decision boundary, CODA introduces virtual unknown classes and optimizes a new training objective to insert unknowns into the latent space by compacting the embedding space of source known classes. To adapt target samples to the source model, we then disambiguate the decision boundaries between known and unknown classes with a test-time training objective, mitigating the adaptivity gap and catastrophic forgetting challenges. Experiments reveal that CODA can significantly outperform the previous best method on standard DG datasets and harmonize the classification accuracy between known and unknown classes",

    "volume": "spotlight",
    "abstract": "Offline-to-online reinforcement learning (RL) is a training paradigm that combines pre-training on a pre-collected dataset with fine-tuning in an online environment. However, the incorporation of online fine-tuning can intensify the well-known distributional shift problem. Existing solutions tackle this problem by imposing a policy constraint on the policy improvement objective in both offline and online learning. They typically advocate a single balance between policy improvement and constraints across diverse data collections. This one-size-fits-all manner may not optimally leverage each collected sample due to the significant variation in data quality across different states. To this end, we introduce Family Offline-to-Online RL (FamO2O), a simple yet effective framework that empowers existing algorithms to determine state-adaptive improvement-constraint balances. FamO2O utilizes a universal model to train a family of policies with different improvement/constraint intensities, and a balance model to select a suitable policy for each state. Theoretically, we prove that state-adaptive balances are necessary for achieving a higher policy performance upper bound. Empirically, extensive experiments show that FamO2O offers a statistically significant improvement over various existing methods, achieving state-of-the-art performance on the D4RL benchmark.

    "title": "A Unified Generalization Analysis of Re-Weighting and Logit-Adjustment for Imbalanced Learning",
    "volume": "spotlight",
    "abstract": "Real-world datasets are typically imbalanced in the sense that only a few classes have numerous samples, while many classes are associated with only a few samples. As a result, a naive ERM learning process will be biased towards the majority classes, making it difficult to generalize to the minority classes. To address this issue, one simple but effective approach is to modify the loss function to emphasize the learning on minority classes, such as re-weighting the losses or adjusting the logits via class-dependent terms. However, existing generalization analysis of such losses is still coarse-grained and fragmented, failing to explain some empirical results. To bridge this gap between theory and practice, we propose a novel technique named data-dependent contraction to capture how these modified losses handle different classes. On top of this technique, a fine-grained generalization bound is established for imbalanced learning, which helps reveal the mystery of re-weighting and logit-adjustment in a unified manner. Furthermore, a principled learning algorithm is developed based on the theoretical insights. Finally, the empirical results on benchmark datasets not only validate the theoretical results but also demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method",

    "abstract": "Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) are considered promising brain-inspired energy-efficient models due to their event-driven computing paradigm. The spatiotemporal spike patterns used to convey information in SNNs consist of both rate coding and temporal coding, where the temporal coding is crucial to biological-plausible learning rules such as spike-timing-dependent-plasticity. The time-based training strategy is proposed to better utilize the temporal information in SNNs and learn in an asynchronous fashion. However, some recent works train SNNs by the time-based scheme with rate-coding-dominated loss functions. In this paper, we first map rate-based loss functions to time-based counterparts and explain why they are also applicable to the time-based training scheme. After that, we infer that loss functions providing adequate positive overall gradients help training by theoretical analysis. Based on this, we propose the enhanced counting loss to replace the commonly used mean square counting loss. In addition, we transfer the training of scale factor in weight standardization into thresholds. Experiments show that our approach outperforms previous time-based training methods in most datasets. Our work provides insights for training SNNs with time-based schemes and offers a fresh perspective on the correlation between rate coding and temporal coding.

    "abstract": "Token embeddings, a mapping from discrete lexical symbols to continuous vectors, are at the heart of any language model (LM). However, lexical symbol meanings can also be determined and even redefined by their structural role in a long context. In this paper, we ask: is it possible for a language model to be performant without \\emph{any} fixed token embeddings? Such a language model would have to rely entirely on the co-occurence and repetition of tokens in the context rather than the \\textit{a priori} identity of any token. To answer this, we study \\textit{lexinvariant}language models that are invariant to lexical symbols and therefore do not need fixed token embeddings in practice. First, we prove that we can construct a lexinvariant LM to converge to the true language model at a uniform rate that is polynomial in terms of the context length, with a constant factor that is sublinear in the vocabulary size. Second, to build a lexinvariant LM, we simply encode tokens using random Gaussian vectors, such that each token maps to the same representation within each sequence but different representations across sequences. Empirically, we demonstrate that it can indeed attain perplexity comparable to that of a standard language model, given a sufficiently long context. We further explore two properties of the lexinvariant language models: First, given text generated from a substitution cipher of English, it implicitly implements Bayesian in-context deciphering and infers the mapping to the underlying real tokens with high accuracy. Second, it has on average 4X better accuracy over synthetic in-context reasoning tasks. Finally, we discuss regularizing standard language models towards lexinvariance and potential practical applications",

For these tasks, humans often start with a high-level algorithmic design and implement each part gradually. We introduce Parsel, a framework enabling automatic implementation and validation of complex algorithms with code LLMs. With Parsel, we automatically decompose algorithmic tasks into hierarchical natural language function descriptions and then search over combinations of possible function implementations using tests. We show that Parsel can be used across domains requiring hierarchical reasoning, including program synthesis and robotic planning. We find that, using Parsel, LLMs solve more competition-level problems in the APPS dataset, resulting in pass rates over 75\\% higher than prior results from directly sampling AlphaCode and Codex, while often using a smaller sample budget. Moreover, with automatically generated tests, we find that Parsel can improve the state-of-the-art pass@1 performance on HumanEval from 67\\% to 85\\%. We also find that LLM-generated robotic plans using Parsel are more than twice as likely to be considered accurate than directly generated plans.

In this work, we introduce EmbodiedGPT, an end-to-end multi-modal foundation model for embodied AI, empowering embodied agents with multi-modal understanding and execution capabilities. To achieve this, we have made the following efforts: (i) We craft a large-scale embodied planning dataset, termed EgoCOT. The dataset consists of carefully selected videos from the Ego4D dataset, along with corresponding high-quality language instructions. Specifically, we generate a sequence of sub-goals with the \"Chain of Thoughts\" mode for effective embodied planning.

Notably, EmbodiedGPT significantly enhances the success rate of the embodied control task by extracting more effective features.

    "title": "Privacy Assessment on Reconstructed Images: Are Existing Evaluation Metrics Faithful to Human Perception?",
    "volume": "spotlight",
    "abstract": "Hand-crafted image quality metrics, such as PSNR and SSIM, are commonly used to evaluate model privacy risk under reconstruction attacks. Under these metrics, reconstructed images that are determined to resemble the original one generally indicate more privacy leakage. Images determined as overall dissimilar, on the other hand, indicate higher robustness against attack. However, there is no guarantee that these metrics well reflect human opinions, which offers trustworthy judgement for model privacy leakage. In this paper, we comprehensively study the faithfulness of these hand-crafted metrics to human perception of privacy information from the reconstructed images. On 5 datasets ranging from natural images, faces, to fine-grained classes, we use 4 existing attack methods to reconstruct images from many different classification models and, for each reconstructed image, we ask multiple human annotators to assess whether this image is recognizable. Our studies reveal that the hand-crafted metrics only have a weak correlation with the human evaluation of privacy leakage and that even these metrics themselves often contradict each other. These observations suggest risks of current metrics in the community. To address this potential risk, we propose a learning-based measure called SemSim to evaluate the Semantic Similarity between the original and reconstructed images. SemSim is trained with a standard triplet loss, using an original image as an anchor, one of its recognizable reconstructed images as a positive sample, and an unrecognizable one as a negative. By training on human annotations, SemSim exhibits a greater reflection of privacy leakage on the semantic level. We show that SemSim has a significantly higher correlation with human judgment compared with existing metrics. Moreover, this strong correlation generalizes to unseen datasets, models and attack methods. We envision this work as a milestone for image quality evaluation closer to the human level.

    "abstract": "Low-bit quantization in image super-resolution (SR) has attracted copious attention in recent research due to its ability to reduce parameters and operations significantly. However, many quantized SR models suffer from accuracy degradation compared to their full-precision counterparts, especially at ultra-low bit widths (2-4 bits), limiting their practical applications. To address this issue, we propose a novel quantized image SR network, called QuantSR, which achieves accurate and efficient SR processing under low-bit quantization. To overcome the representation homogeneity caused by quantization in the network, we introduce the Redistribution-driven Learnable Quantizer (RLQ). This is accomplished through an inference-agnostic efficient redistribution design, which adds additional information in both forward and backward passes to improve the representation ability of quantized networks. Furthermore, to achieve flexible inference and break the upper limit of accuracy, we propose the Depth-dynamic Quantized Architecture (DQA). Our DQA allows for the trade-off between efficiency and accuracy during inference through weight sharing. Our comprehensive experiments show that QuantSR outperforms existing state-of-the-art quantized SR networks in terms of accuracy while also providing more competitive computational efficiency. In addition, we demonstrate the scheme's satisfactory architecture generality by providing QuantSR-C and QuantSR-T for both convolution and Transformer versions, respectively.

Characterizing the minimal instance-specific error probability for this problem constitutes one of the important remaining open problems in MABs. When arms are selected using a static sampling strategy, the error probability decays exponentially with the number of samples at a rate that can be explicitly derived via Large Deviation techniques. Analyzing the performance of algorithms with adaptive sampling strategies is however much more challenging. In this paper, we establish a connection between the Large Deviation Principle (LDP) satisfied by the empirical proportions of arm draws and that satisfied by the empirical arm rewards. This connection holds for any adaptive algorithm, and is leveraged (i) to improve error probability upper bounds of some existing algorithms, such as the celebrated SR (Successive Rejects) algorithm \\cite{audibert2010best}, and (ii) to devise and analyze new algorithms. In particular, we present CR (Continuous Rejects), a truly adaptive algorithm that can reject arms in {\\it any} round based on the observed empirical gaps between the rewards of various arms.

    "abstract": "Detecting unseen instances based on multi-view templates is a challenging problem due to its open-world nature. Traditional methodologies, which primarily rely on $2 \\mathrm{D}$ representations and matching techniques, are often inadequate in handling pose variations and occlusions. To solve this, we introduce VoxDet, a pioneer 3D geometry-aware framework that fully utilizes the strong 3D voxel representation and reliable voxel matching mechanism. VoxDet first ingeniously proposes template voxel aggregation (TVA) module, effectively transforming multi-view 2D images into 3D voxel features. By leveraging associated camera poses, these features are aggregated into a compact 3D template voxel. In novel instance detection, this voxel representation demonstrates heightened resilience to occlusion and pose variations. We also discover that a $3 \\mathrm{D}$ reconstruction objective helps to pre-train the 2D-3D mapping in TVA. Second, to quickly align with the template voxel, VoxDet incorporates a Query Voxel Matching (QVM) module. The 2D queries are first converted into their voxel representation with the learned 2D-3D mapping. We find that since the 3D voxel representations encode the geometry, we can first estimate the relative rotation and then compare the aligned voxels, leading to improved accuracy and efficiency. In addition to method, we also introduce the first instance detection benchmark, RoboTools, where 20 unique instances are video-recorded with camera extrinsic. RoboTools also provides 24 challenging cluttered scenarios with more than $9 \\mathrm{k}$ box annotations. Exhaustive experiments are conducted on the demanding LineMod-Occlusion, YCB-video, and RoboTools benchmarks, where VoxDet outperforms various $2 \\mathrm{D}$ baselines remarkably with faster speed.

Starting from a dynamical mean field theory description of infinite width deep neural network kernel and prediction dynamics, we provide a characterization of the $\\mathcal{O}(1/\\sqrt{\\text{width}})$ fluctuations of the DMFT order parameters over random initializations of the network weights. Our results, while perturbative in width, unlike prior analyses, are non-perturbative in the strength of feature learning. In the lazy limit of network training, all kernels are random but static in time and the prediction variance has a universal form. However, in the rich, feature learning regime, the fluctuations of the kernels and predictions are dynamically coupled with a variance that can be computed self-consistently. In two layer networks, we show how feature learning can dynamically reduce the variance of the final tangent kernel and final network predictions. We also show how initialization variance can slow down online learning in wide but finite networks. In deeper networks, kernel variance can dramatically accumulate through subsequent layers at large feature learning strengths, but feature learning continues to improve the signal-to-noise ratio of the feature kernels. In discrete time, we demonstrate that large learning rate phenomena such as edge of stability effects can be well captured by infinite width dynamics and that initialization variance can decrease dynamically.

With the swift advancement of large language models, such as ChatGPT, the need to bridge the gap between the brain and languages becomes increasingly pressing. Current methods, however, require eye-tracking fixations or event markers to segment brain dynamics into word-level features, which can restrict the practical application of these systems. These event markers may not be readily available or could be challenging to acquire during real-time inference, and the sequence of eye fixations may not align with the order of spoken words. To tackle these issues, we introduce a novel framework, DeWave, that integrates discrete encoding sequences into open-vocabulary EEG-to-text translation tasks. DeWave uses a quantized variational encoder to derive discrete codex encoding and align it with pre-trained language models. This discrete codex representation brings forth two advantages: 1) it alleviates the order mismatch between eye fixations and spoken words by introducing text-EEG contrastive alignment training, and 2) it minimizes the interference caused by individual differences in EEG waves through an invariant discrete codex. Our model surpasses the previous baseline (40.1 and 31.7) by 3.06% and 6.34\\%, respectively, achieving 41.35 BLEU-1 and 33.71 Rouge-F on the ZuCo Dataset.

Given its broad success in conditional sampling, classifier-guided diffusion modeling is a promising foundation for protein design, leading many to develop guided diffusion models for structure with inverse folding to recover sequences. In this work, we propose diffusioN Optimized Sampling (NOS), a guidance method for discrete diffusion models that follows gradients in the hidden states of the denoising network. NOS makes it possible to perform design directly in sequence space, circumventing significant limitations of structure-based methods, including scarce data and challenging inverse design. Moreover, we use NOS to generalize LaMBO, a Bayesian optimization procedure for sequence design that facilitates multiple objectives and edit-based constraints. The resulting method, LaMBO-2, enables discrete diffusions and stronger performance with limited edits through a novel application of saliency maps. We apply LaMBO-2 to a real-world protein design task, optimizing antibodies for higher expression yield and binding affinity to several therapeutic targets under locality and developability constraints, attaining a 99\\% expression rate and 40\\% binding rate in exploratory in vitro experiments",

    "abstract": "Self-consistent Field (SCF) equation is a type of nonlinear eigenvalue problem in which the matrix to be eigen-decomposed is a function of its own eigenvectors. It is of great significance in computational science for its connection to the Schrödinger equation. Traditional fixed-point iteration methods for solving such equations suffer from non-convergence issues. In this work, we present a novel perspective on such SCF equations as a principal component analysis (PCA) for non-stationary time series, in which a distribution and its own top principal components are mutually updated over time, and the equilibrium state of the model corresponds to the solution of the SCF equations. By the new perspective, online PCA techniques are able to engage in so as to enhance the convergence of the model towards the equilibrium state, acting as a new set of tools for converging the SCF equations. With several numerical adaptations, we then develop a new algorithm for converging the SCF equation, and demonstrated its high convergence capacity with experiments on both synthesized and real electronic structure scenarios",

    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "Common explanations for shortcut learning assume that the shortcut improves prediction only under the training distribution. Thus, models trained in the typical way by minimizing log-loss using gradient descent, which we call default-ERM, should utilize the shortcut. However, even when the stable feature determines the label in the training distribution and the shortcut does not provide any additional information, like in perception tasks, default-ERM exhibits shortcut learning. Why are such solutions preferred when the loss can be driven to zero when using the stable feature alone? By studying a linear perception task, we show that default-ERM's preference for maximizing the margin, even without overparameterization, leads to models that depend more on the shortcut than the stable feature. This insight suggests that default-ERM's implicit inductive bias towards max-margin may be unsuitable for perception tasks. Instead, we consider inductive biases toward uniform margins. We show that uniform margins guarantee sole dependence on the perfect stable feature in the linear perception task and suggest alternative loss functions, termed margin control (MARG-CTRL), that encourage uniform-margin solutions. MARG-CTRL techniques mitigate shortcut learning on a variety of vision and language tasks, showing that changing inductive biases can remove the need for complicated shortcut-mitigating methods in perception tasks",

    "abstract": "Measuring dependence between two random variables is of great importance in various domains but is difficult to compute in today's complex environments with high-dimensional data. Recently, slicing methods have shown to be a scalable approach to measuring mutual information (MI) between high-dimensional variables by projecting these variables into one-dimensional spaces. Unfortunately, these methods use uniform distributions of slicing directions, which generally discard informative features between variables and thus lead to inaccurate quantification of dependence. In this paper, we propose a principled framework that searches for an \\textit{optimal} distribution of slices for MI. Importantly, we answer theoretical questions about finding the optimal slicing distribution in the context of MI and develop corresponding theoretical analyses. We also develop a practical algorithm, connecting our theoretical results with modern machine learning frameworks.

    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "Latent Variable Models (LVMs) propose to model the dynamics of neural populations by capturing low-dimensional structures that represent features involved in neural activity. Recent LVMs are based on deep learning methodology where a deep neural network is trained to reconstruct the same neural activity given as input and as a result to build the latent representation. Without taking past or future activity into account such a task is non-causal. In contrast, the task of forecasting neural activity based on given input extends the reconstruction task. LVMs that are trained on such a task could potentially capture temporal causality constraints within its latent representation. Forecasting has received less attention than reconstruction due to recording challenges such as limited neural measurements and trials. In this work, we address modeling neural population dynamics via the forecasting task and improve forecasting performance by including a prior, which consists of pairwise neural unit interaction as a multivariate dynamic system. Our proposed model---Additive, Multiplicative, and Adaptive Graph Neural Network (AMAG)---leverages additive and multiplicative message-passing operations analogous to the interactions in neuronal systems and adaptively learns the interaction among neural units to forecast their future activity. We demonstrate the advantage of AMAG compared to non-GNN based methods on synthetic data and multiple modalities of neural recordings (field potentials from penetrating electrodes or surface-level micro-electrocorticography) from four rhesus macaques. Our results show the ability of AMAG to recover ground truth spatial interactions and yield estimation for future dynamics of the neural population",

    "abstract": "Studying conditional independence among many variables with few observations is a challenging task. Gaussian Graphical Models (GGMs) tackle this problem by encouraging sparsity in the precision matrix through $l_q$ regularization with $q\\leq1$. However, most GMMs rely on the $l_1$ norm because the objective is highly non-convex for sub-$l_1$ pseudo-norms. In the frequentist formulation, the $l_1$ norm relaxation provides the solution path as a function of the shrinkage parameter $\\lambda$. In the Bayesian formulation, sparsity is instead encouraged through a Laplace prior, but posterior inference for different $\\lambda$ requires repeated runs of expensive Gibbs samplers. Here we propose a general framework for variational inference with matrix-variate Normalizing Flow in GGMs, which unifies the benefits of frequentist and Bayesian frameworks. As a key improvement on previous work, we train with one flow a continuum of sparse regression models jointly for all regularization parameters $\\lambda$ and all $l_q$ norms, including non-convex sub-$l_1$ pseudo-norms. Within one model we thus have access to (i) the evolution of the posterior for any $\\lambda$ and any $l_q$ (pseudo-) norm, (ii) the marginal log-likelihood for model selection, and (iii) the frequentist solution paths through simulated annealing in the MAP limit",

Despite their impressive performance, these LLMs, with sizes ranging from several billion to hundreds of billions of parameters, demand substantial computational resources, making their training and inference expensive and inefficient. Furthermore, adapting these models to downstream applications, particularly complex tasks, is often unfeasible due to the extensive hardware requirements for finetuning, even when utilizing parameter-efficient approaches such as prompt tuning. Additionally, the most powerful multi-task LLMs, such as OPT-IML-175B and FLAN-PaLM-540B, are not publicly accessible, severely limiting their customization potential. To address these challenges, we introduce a pretrained small scorer, \\textit{Cappy}, designed to enhance the performance and efficiency of multi-task LLMs. With merely 360 million parameters, Cappy functions either independently on classification tasks or serve as an auxiliary component for LLMs, boosting their performance. Moreover, Cappy enables efficiently integrating downstream supervision without requiring LLM finetuning nor the access to their parameters. Our experiments demonstrate that, when working independently on 11 language understanding tasks from PromptSource, Cappy outperforms LLMs that are several orders of magnitude larger. Besides, on 45 complex tasks from BIG-Bench, Cappy boosts the performance of the advanced multi-task LLM, FLAN-T5, by a large margin. Furthermore, Cappy is flexible to cooperate with other LLM adaptations, including finetuning and in-context learning, offering additional performance enhancement",

To address these questions, we perform a controlled study of compositional generalization in conditional diffusion models in a synthetic setting, varying different attributes of the training data and measuring the model's ability to generate samples out-of-distribution. Our results show that: (i) the compositional structure of the data-generating process governs the order in which capabilities and an ability to compose them emerges; (ii) learning individual concepts impacts performance on compositional tasks, multiplicatively explaining sudden emergence; and (iii) learning and composing capabilities is difficult under correlations.

To address this gap, we systematically incorporated neuroscience-derived architectural components into CNNs to identify a set of mechanisms and architectures that more comprehensively explain V1 activity.

Moreover, analyses of the learned parameters of these components and stimuli that maximally activate neurons of the evaluated networks provide support for their role in explaining neural properties of V1.

Nonetheless, the inherent variability of solar irradiance poses a significant challenge for seamlessly integrating solar power into the electrical grid. While the majority of prior research has centered on employing purely time series-based methodologies for solar forecasting, only a limited number of studies have taken into account factors such as cloud cover or the surrounding physical context. In this paper, we put forth a deep learning architecture designed to harness spatio-temporal context using satellite data, to attain highly accurate day-ahead time-series forecasting for any given station, with a particular emphasis on forecasting Global Horizontal Irradiance (GHI). We also suggest a methodology to extract a distribution for each time step prediction, which can serve as a very valuable measure of uncertainty attached to the forecast. When evaluating models, we propose a testing scheme in which we separate particularly difficult examples from easy ones, in order to capture the model performances in crucial situations, which in the case of this study are the days suffering from varying cloudy conditions. Furthermore, we present a new multi-modal dataset gathering satellite imagery over a large zone and time series for solar irradiance and other related physical variables from multiple geographically diverse solar stations.

    "abstract": "Interpretable AI tools are often motivated by the goal of understanding model behavior in out-of-distribution (OOD) contexts. Despite the attention this area of study receives, there are comparatively few cases where these tools have identified previously unknown bugs in models. We argue that this is due, in part, to a common feature of many interpretability methods: they analyze model behavior by using a particular dataset. This only allows for the study of the model in the context of features that the user can sample in advance. To address this, a growing body of research involves interpreting models using feature synthesis methods that do not depend on a dataset. In this paper, we benchmark the usefulness of interpretability tools for model debugging. Our key insight is that we can implant human-interpretable trojans into models and then evaluate these tools based on whether they can help humans discover them. This is analogous to finding OOD bugs, except the ground truth is known, allowing us to know when a user's interpretation is correct. We make four contributions. (1) We propose trojan discovery as an evaluation task for interpretability tools and introduce a benchmark with 12 trojans of 3 different types. (2) We demonstrate the difficulty of this benchmark with a preliminary evaluation of 16 state-of-the-art feature attribution/saliency tools. Even under ideal conditions, given direct access to data with the trojan trigger, these methods still often fail to identify bugs. (3) We evaluate 7 feature-synthesis methods on our benchmark.

    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "Neuroprostheses show potential in restoring lost sensory function and enhancing human capabilities, but the sensations produced by current devices often seem unnatural or distorted. Exact placement of implants and differences in individual perception lead to significant variations in stimulus response, making personalized stimulus optimization a key challenge. Bayesian optimization could be used to optimize patient-specific stimulation parameters with limited noisy observations, but is not feasible for high-dimensional stimuli. Alternatively, deep learning models can optimize stimulus encoding strategies, but typically assume perfect knowledge of patient-specific variations. Here we propose a novel, practically feasible approach that overcomes both of these fundamental limitations. First, a deep encoder network is trained to produce optimal stimuli for any individual patient by inverting a forward model mapping electrical stimuli to visual percepts. Second, a preferential Bayesian optimization strategy utilizes this encoder to learn the optimal patient-specific parameters for a new patient, using a minimal number of pairwise comparisons between candidate stimuli. We demonstrate the viability of this approach on a novel, state-of-the-art visual prosthesis model. Our approach quickly learns a personalized stimulus encoder and leads to dramatic improvements in the quality of restored vision, outperforming existing encoding strategies. Further, this approach is robust to noisy patient feedback and misspecifications in the underlying forward model. Overall, our results suggest that combining the strengths of deep learning and Bayesian optimization could significantly improve the perceptual experience of patients fitted with visual prostheses and may prove a viable solution for a range of neuroprosthetic technologies",

We also prove that reach-avoid problems are naturally modeled as convex-concave zero-sum stochastic Stackelberg games. Finally, we run experiments which demonstrate that modeling reach-avoid problems as Stackelberg games leads to solutions which are safer, thus less likely to result in collisions, and liver, thus more likely to reach their goals, than alternative solutions, in particular Nash equilibrium",

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) solve problems more accurately and interpretably when instructed to work out the answer step by step using a \"chain-of-thought\" (CoT) prompt. One can also improve LLMs' performance on a specific task by supervised fine-tuning, i.e., by using gradient ascent on some tunable parameters to maximize the average log-likelihood of correct answers from a labeled training set. Naively combining CoT with supervised tuning requires supervision not just of the correct answers, but also of detailed rationales that lead to those answers; these rationales are expensive to produce by hand. Instead, we propose a fine-tuning strategy that tries to maximize the \\emph{marginal} log-likelihood of generating a correct answer using CoT prompting, approximately averaging over all possible rationales. The core challenge is sampling from the posterior over rationales conditioned on the correct answer; we address it using a simple Markov-chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm inspired by the self-taught reasoner (STaR), memoized wake-sleep, Markovian score climbing, and persistent contrastive divergence. This algorithm also admits a novel control-variate technique that drives the variance of our gradient estimates to zero as the model improves. Applying our technique to GSM8K and the tasks in BIG-Bench Hard, we find that this MCMC-EM fine-tuning technique typically improves the model's accuracy on held-out examples more than STaR or prompt-tuning with or without CoT",

    "abstract": "The Option Keyboard (OK) was recently proposed as a method for transferring behavioral knowledge across tasks. OK transfers knowledge by adaptively combining subsets of known behaviors using Successor Features (SFs) and Generalized Policy Improvement (GPI). However, it relies on hand-designed state-features and task encodings which are cumbersome to design for every new environment. In this work, we propose the \"Successor Features Keyboard\" (SFK), which enables transfer with discovered state-features and task encodings. To enable discovery, we propose the \"Categorical Successor Feature Approximator\" (CSFA), a novel learning algorithm for estimating SFs while jointly discovering state-features and task encodings. With SFK and CSFA, we achieve the first demonstration of transfer with SFs in a challenging 3D environment where all the necessary representations are discovered. We first compare CSFA against other methods for approximating SFs and show that only CSFA discovers representations compatible with SF&GPI at this scale. We then compare SFK against transfer learning baselines and show that it transfers most quickly to long-horizon tasks",

    "title": "Language Models Meet World Models: Embodied Experiences Enhance Language Models",
    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "While large language models (LMs) have shown remarkable capabilities across numerous tasks, they often struggle with simple reasoning and planning in physical environments, such as understanding object permanence or planning household activities. The limitation arises from the fact that LMs are trained only on written text and miss essential embodied knowledge and skills. In this paper, we propose a new paradigm of enhancing LMs by finetuning them with world models, to gain diverse embodied knowledge while retaining their general language capabilities. Our approach deploys an embodied agent in a world model, particularly a simulator of the physical world (VirtualHome), and acquires a diverse set of embodied experiences through both goal-oriented planning and random exploration. These experiences are then used to finetune LMs to teach diverse abilities of reasoning and acting in the physical world, e.g., planning and completing goals, object permanence and tracking, etc. Moreover, it is desirable to preserve the generality of LMs during finetuning, which facilitates generalizing the embodied knowledge across tasks rather than being tied to specific simulations. We thus further introduce the classical elastic weight consolidation (EWC) for selective weight updates, combined with low-rank adapters (LoRA) for training efficiency. Extensive experiments show our approach substantially improves base LMs on 18 downstream tasks by 64.28% on average. In particular, the small LMs (1.3B, 6B, and 13B) enhanced by our approach match or even outperform much larger LMs (e.g., ChatGPT)",

    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "We develop a series of differential privacy (DP) algorithms from a family of random projection (RP) and sign random projection (SignRP) methods. We first show how to improve the previous DP-RP approach using the ``optimal Gaussian mechanism''. Then, we propose a series of DP-SignRP algorithms that leverage the robustness of the ``sign flipping probability'' of random projections. That is, given $x = \\sum_{i=1}^p u_i w_{i}$ where $u$ is a $p$-dimensional data vector and $w$ is a symmetric random vector, $sign(x)$ only has a fairly small probability to be flipped if there is a small modification on data $u$, depending on the specific distribution of $w$. This robustness leads to our novel design of ``smooth flipping probability'' for SignRP-type algorithms with better utility than using the standard randomized response mechanism. Retrieval and classification experiments demonstrate that, among the presented DP-RP algorithms, \\textbf{DP-SignOPORP} (where OPORP is an improvement over the celebrated count-sketch algorithms), performs the best in general. In the industrial practice, DP methods were not very popular for machine learning or search, largely because the performance typically would drop substantially if DP is applied. Since our proposed new DP algorithms have significantly improved the performance, it is anticipated that our work will motivate a wide adoption of DP in practice. Finally, we stress that, since our methods are applied to the original data (i.e., feature vectors), the privacy of downstream tasks is naturally protected",

    "abstract": "The _data market design_ problem is a problem in economic theory to find a set of signaling schemes (statistical experiments) to maximize expected revenue to the information seller, where each experiment reveals some of the information known to a seller and has a corresponding price. Each buyer has their own decision to make in a world environment, and their subjective expected value for the information associated with a particular experiment comes from the improvement in this decision and depends on their prior and value for different outcomes. In a setting with multiple buyers, a buyer's expected value for an experiment may also depend on the information sold to others. We introduce the application of deep learning for the design of revenue-optimal data markets, looking to expand the frontiers of what can be understood and achieved. Relative to earlier work on deep learning for auction design, we must learn signaling schemes rather than allocation rules and handle _obedience constraints_ &mdash; these arising from modeling the downstream actions of buyers &mdash; in addition to incentive constraints on bids. Our experiments demonstrate that this new deep learning framework can almost precisely replicate all known solutions from theory, expand to more complex settings, and be used to establish the optimality of new designs for data markets and make conjectures in regard to the structure of optimal designs",

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs), typically designed as a function of next-word prediction, have excelled across extensive NLP tasks. Despite the generality, next-word prediction is often not an efficient formulation for many of the tasks, demanding an extreme scale of model parameters (10s or 100s of billions) and sometimes yielding suboptimal performance. In practice, it is often desirable to build more efficient models---despite being less versatile, they still apply to a substantial subset of problems, delivering on par or even superior performance with much smaller model sizes. In this paper, we propose text alignment as an efficient unified model for a wide range of crucial tasks involving text entailment, similarity, question answering (and answerability), factual consistency, and so forth. Given a pair of texts, the model measures the degree of alignment between their information. We instantiate an alignment model through lightweight finetuning of RoBERTa (355M parameters) using 5.9M examples from 28 datasets. Despite its compact size, extensive experiments show the model's efficiency and strong performance: (1) On over 20 datasets of aforementioned diverse tasks, the model matches or surpasses FLAN-T5 models that have around 2x or 10x more parameters; the single unified model also outperforms task-specific models finetuned on individual datasets; (2) When applied to evaluate factual consistency of language generation on 23 datasets, our model improves over various baselines, including the much larger GPT-3.5 (ChatGPT) and sometimes even GPT-4; (3) The lightweight model can also serve as an add-on component for LLMs such as GPT-3.5 in question answering tasks, improving the average exact match (EM) score by 17.94 and F1 score by 15.05 through identifying unanswerable questions",

Specifically, we study the recent notion of _significant shifts_ (Suk and Kpotufe, 2022), and ask whether one can design an _adaptive_ algorithm for the dueling problem with $O(\\sqrt{K\\tilde{L}T})$ dynamic regret, where $\\tilde{L}$ is the (unknown) number of significant shifts in preferences. We show that the answer to this question depends on the properties of underlying preference distributions.

Secondly, we show that $\\text{SST}\\cap \\text{STI}$ is the largest amongst popular classes of preference distributions where it is possible to design such an algorithm.

We question this mismatch, and ask whether video pretraining can yield visual representations that bear the hallmarks of human perception: generalisation across tasks, robustness to perturbations, and consistency with human judgements. To that end we propose a novel procedure for curating videos, and develop a contrastive framework which learns from the complex transformations therein. This simple paradigm for distilling knowledge from videos, called VITO, yields general representations that far outperform prior video pretraining methods on image understanding tasks, and image pretraining methods on video understanding tasks. Moreover, VITO representations are significantly more robust to natural and synthetic deformations than image-, video-, and adversarially-trained ones. Finally, VITO's predictions are strongly aligned with human judgements, surpassing models that were specifically trained for that purpose. Together, these results suggest that video pretraining could be a simple way of learning unified, robust, and human-aligned representations of the visual world",

    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) can achieve strong performance on many tasks by producing step-by-step reasoning before giving a final output, often referred to as chain-of-thought reasoning (CoT). It is tempting to interpret these CoT explanations as the LLM's process for solving a task. This level of transparency into LLMs' predictions would yield significant safety benefits. However, we find that CoT explanations can systematically misrepresent the true reason for a model's prediction. We demonstrate that CoT explanations can be heavily influenced by adding biasing features to model inputs—e.g., by reordering the multiple-choice options in a few-shot prompt to make the answer always \"(A)\"—which models systematically fail to mention in their explanations. When we bias models toward incorrect answers, they frequently generate CoT explanations rationalizing those answers. This causes accuracy to drop by as much as 36% on a suite of 13 tasks from BIG-Bench Hard, when testing with GPT-3.5 from OpenAI and Claude 1.0 from Anthropic. On a social-bias task, model explanations justify giving answers in line with stereotypes without mentioning the influence of these social biases. Our findings indicate that CoT explanations can be plausible yet misleading, which risks increasing our trust in LLMs without guaranteeing their safety. Building more transparent and explainable systems will require either improving CoT faithfulness through targeted efforts or abandoning CoT in favor of alternative methods",

    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "Goal-Conditioned Reinforcement Learning (RL) problems often have access to sparse rewards where the agent receives a reward signal only when it has achieved the goal, making policy optimization a difficult problem. Several works augment this sparse reward with a learned dense reward function, but this can lead to sub-optimal policies if the reward is misaligned. Moreover, recent works have demonstrated that effective shaping rewards for a particular problem can depend on the underlying learning algorithm. This paper introduces a novel way to encourage exploration called $f$-Policy Gradients, or $f$-PG. $f$-PG minimizes the f-divergence between the agent's state visitation distribution and the goal, which we show can lead to an optimal policy. We derive gradients for various f-divergences to optimize this objective. Our learning paradigm provides dense learning signals for exploration in sparse reward settings. We further introduce an entropy-regularized policy optimization objective, that we call $state$-MaxEnt RL (or $s$-MaxEnt RL) as a special case of our objective. We show that several metric-based shaping rewards like L2 can be used with $s$-MaxEnt RL, providing a common ground to study such metric-based shaping rewards with efficient exploration. We find that $f$-PG has better performance compared to standard policy gradient methods on a challenging gridworld as well as the Point Maze and FetchReach environments.

To automate this process from a data-driven perspective, we propose a disentangled Wasserstein autoencoder with an auxiliary classifier, which isolates the function-related patterns from the rest with theoretical guarantees. This enables one-pass protein sequence editing and improves the understanding of the resulting sequences and editing actions involved. To demonstrate its effectiveness, we apply it to T-cell receptors (TCRs), a well-studied structure-function case. We show that our method can be used to alter the function of TCRs without changing the structural backbone, outperforming several competing methods in generation quality and efficiency, and requiring only 10\\% of the running time needed by baseline models.

Here, we evaluate the role of hierarchical inference and its alignment with brain function in the domain of motion perception. We first introduce a novel synthetic data framework, Retinal Optic Flow Learning (ROFL), which enables control over motion statistics and their causes. We then present a new hierarchical VAE and test it against alternative models on two downstream tasks: (i) predicting ground truth causes of retinal optic flow (e.g., self-motion); and (ii) predicting the responses of neurons in the motion processing pathway of primates. We manipulate the model architectures (hierarchical versus non-hierarchical), loss functions, and the causal structure of the motion stimuli. We find that hierarchical latent structure in the model leads to several improvements. First, it improves the linear decodability of ground truth variables and does so in a sparse and disentangled manner. Second, our hierarchical VAE outperforms previous state-of-the-art models in predicting neuronal responses and exhibits sparse latent-to-neuron relationships. These results depend on the causal structure of the world, indicating that alignment between brains and artificial neural networks depends not only on architecture but also on matching ecologically relevant stimulus statistics. Taken together, our results suggest that hierarchical Bayesian inference underlines the brain's understanding of the world, and hierarchical VAEs can effectively model this understanding",

We introduce a natural and mild restriction on the meta-level combination functions of the local trials. This allows us to mathematically quantify the cost of compressing $m$ trials into real-valued test statistics and combining these. We then derive minimax lower and matching upper bounds for the separation rates of standard combination methods for e.g. p-values and e-values, quantifying the loss relative to using the full, pooled data. We observe an elbow effect, revealing that in certain cases combining the locally optimal tests in each trial results in a sub-optimal {meta-analysis} method and develop approaches to achieve the global optima. We also explore the possible gains of allowing limited coordination between the trial designs.

We first establish the minimax dynamic regret rate in this less understood setting in terms of number of changes $L$ and total-variation $V$, both capturing all changes in distribution over context space, and argue that state-of-the-art procedures are suboptimal in this setting. Next, we tend to the question of an _adaptivity_ for this setting, i.e. achieving the minimax rate without knowledge of $L$ or $V$. Quite importantly, we posit that the bandit problem, viewed locally at a given context $X_t$, should not be affected by reward changes in other parts of context space $\\cal X$. We therefore propose a notion of _change_, which we term _experienced significant shifts_, that better accounts for locality, and thus counts considerably less changes than $L$ and $V$. Furthermore, similar to recent work on non-stationary MAB (Suk & Kpotufe, 2022), _experienced significant shifts_ only count the most _significant_ changes in mean rewards, e.g., severe best-arm changes relevant to observed contexts.

    "abstract": "We study the complexity of Non-Gaussian Component Analysis (NGCA) in the Statistical Query (SQ) model. Prior work developed a methodology to prove SQ lower bounds for NGCA that have been applicable to a wide range of contexts. In particular, it was known that for any univariate distribution $A$ satisfying certain conditions, distinguishing between a standard multivariate Gaussian and a distribution that behaves like $A$ in a random hidden direction and like a standard Gaussian in the orthogonal complement, is SQ-hard. The required conditions were that (1) $A$ matches many low-order moments with a standard Gaussian, and (2) the chi-squared norm of $A$ with respect to the standard Gaussian is finite. While the moment-matching condition is clearly necessary for hardness, the chi-squared condition was only required for technical reasons. In this work, we establish that the latter condition is indeed not necessary. In particular, we prove near-optimal SQ lower bounds for NGCA under the moment-matching condition only",

    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "Randomized experiments have been the gold standard for assessing the effectiveness of a treatment, policy, or intervention, spanning various fields, including social sciences, biomedical studies, and e-commerce. The classical complete randomization approach assigns treatments based on a pre-specified probability and may lead to inefficient use of data. Adaptive experiments improve upon complete randomization by sequentially learning and updating treatment assignment probabilities using accrued evidence during the experiment. Hence, they can help achieve efficient data use and higher estimation efficiency. However, their application can also raise fairness and equity concerns, as assignment probabilities may vary drastically across groups of participants. Furthermore, when treatment is expected to be extremely beneficial to certain groups of participants, it is more appropriate to expose many of these participants to favorable treatment. In response to these challenges, we propose a fair adaptive experiment strategy that simultaneously enhances data use efficiency, achieves an ``envy-free'' treatment assignment guarantee, and improves the overall welfare of participants. An important feature of our proposed strategy is that we do not impose parametric modeling assumptions on the outcome variables, making it more versatile and applicable to a wider array of applications. Through our theoretical investigation, we characterize the convergence rate of the estimated treatment effects and the associated standard deviations at the group level and further prove that our adaptive treatment assignment algorithm, despite not having a closed-form expression, approaches the optimal allocation rule asymptotically. Our proof strategy takes into account the fact that the allocation decisions in our design depend on sequentially accumulated data, which poses a significant challenge in characterizing the properties and conducting statistical inference of our method. We further provide simulation evidence and two synthetic data studies to showcase the performance of our fair adaptive experiment strategy",

    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "Shape completion aims to recover the full 3D geometry of an object from a partial observation. This problem is inherently multi-modal since there can be many ways to plausibly complete the missing regions of a shape. Such diversity would be indicative of the underlying uncertainty of the shape and could be preferable for downstream tasks such as planning. In this paper, we propose a novel conditional generative adversarial network that can produce many diverse plausible completions of a partially observed point cloud. To enable our network to produce multiple completions for the same partial input, we introduce stochasticity into our network via style modulation. By extracting style codes from complete shapes during training, and learning a distribution over them, our style codes can explicitly carry shape category information leading to better completions. We further introduce diversity penalties and discriminators at multiple scales to prevent conditional mode collapse and to train without the need for multiple ground truth completions for each partial input. Evaluations across several synthetic and real datasets demonstrate that our method achieves significant improvements in respecting the partial observations while obtaining greater diversity in completions",

    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "In reverberant conditions with multiple concurrent speakers, each microphone acquires a mixture signal of multiple speakers at a different location. In over-determined conditions where the microphones out-number speakers, we can narrow down the solutions to speaker images and realize unsupervised speech separation by leveraging each mixture signal as a constraint (i.e., the estimated speaker images at a microphone should add up to the mixture). Equipped with this insight, we propose UNSSOR, an algorithm for $\\underline{u}$nsupervised $\\underline{n}$eural $\\underline{s}$peech $\\underline{s}$eparation by leveraging $\\underline{o}$ver-determined training mixtu$\\underline{r}$es. At each training step, we feed an input mixture to a deep neural network (DNN) to produce an intermediate estimate for each speaker, linearly filter the estimates, and optimize a loss so that, at each microphone, the filtered estimates of all the speakers can add up to the mixture to satisfy the above constraint. We show that this loss can promote unsupervised separation of speakers. The linear filters are computed in each sub-band based on the mixture and DNN estimates through the forward convolutive prediction (FCP) algorithm. To address the frequency permutation problem incurred by using sub-band FCP, a loss term based on minimizing intra-source magnitude scattering is proposed. Although UNSSOR requires over-determined training mixtures, we can train DNNs to achieve under-determined separation (e.g., unsupervised monaural speech separation). Evaluation results on two-speaker separation in reverberant conditions show the effectiveness and potential of UNSSOR",

    "abstract": "Data augmentation (DA) encodes invariance and provides implicit regularization critical to a model's performance in image classification tasks. However, while DA improves average accuracy, recent studies have shown that its impact can be highly class dependent: achieving optimal average accuracy comes at the cost of significantly hurting individual class accuracy by as much as 20% on ImageNet. There has been little progress in resolving class-level accuracy drops due to a limited understanding of these effects. In this work, we present a framework for understanding how DA interacts with class-level learning dynamics. Using higher-quality multi-label annotations on ImageNet, we systematically categorize the affected classes and find that the majority are inherently ambiguous, co-occur, or involve fine-grained distinctions, while DA controls the model's bias towards one of the closely related classes. While many of the previously reported performance drops are explained by multi-label annotations, we identify other sources of accuracy degradations by analyzing class confusions. We show that simple class-conditional augmentation strategies informed by our framework improve performance on the negatively affected classes",

We illustrate the theoretical advantages of NAS-X over previous methods and explore these advantages empirically in a variety of tasks, including a challenging application to mechanistic models of neuronal dynamics.

    "abstract": "Autoregressive sampling from large language models has led to state-of-the-art results in several natural language tasks. However, autoregressive sampling generates tokens one at a time making it slow, and even prohibitive in certain tasks. One way to speed up sampling is *speculative decoding*: use a small model to sample a *draft* (block or sequence of tokens), and then score all tokens in the draft by the large language model in parallel. A subset of the tokens in the draft are accepted (and the rest rejected) based on a statistical method to guarantee that the final output follows the distribution of the large model. In this work, we provide a principled understanding of speculative decoding through the lens of optimal transport (OT) with *membership cost*. This framework can be viewed as an extension of the well-known *maximal-coupling* problem. This new formulation enables us to generalize the speculative decoding method to allow for a set of $k$ candidates at the token-level, which leads to an improved optimal membership cost. We show that the optimal draft selection algorithm (transport plan) can be computed via linear programming, whose best-known runtime is exponential in $k$. We then propose a valid draft selection algorithm whose acceptance probability is $(1-1/e)$-optimal multiplicatively. Moreover, it can be computed in time almost linear with size of domain of a single token. Using this new draft selection algorithm, we develop a new autoregressive sampling algorithm called *SpecTr*, which provides speedup in decoding while ensuring that there is no quality degradation in the decoded output. We experimentally demonstrate that for state-of-the-art large language models, the proposed approach achieves a wall clock speedup of 2.13X, a further 1.37X speedup over speculative decoding on standard benchmarks",

Despite the success, existing provably efficient algorithms typically rely on the accessibility of immediate feedback upon taking actions. The failure to account for the impact of delay in observations can significantly degrade the performance of real-world systems due to the regret blow-up. In this work, we tackle the challenge of delayed feedback in RL with linear function approximation by employing posterior sampling, which has been shown to empirically outperform the popular UCB algorithms in a wide range of regimes.

For example, in drug discovery, there is a need to model the effects of diverse interventions on cells in order to characterize unknown biological mechanisms of action. We propose the Sparse Additive Mechanism Shift Variational Autoencoder, SAMS-VAE, to combine compositionality, disentanglement, and interpretability for perturbation models. SAMS-VAE models the latent state of a perturbed sample as the sum of a local latent variable capturing sample-specific variation and sparse global variables of latent intervention effects. Crucially, SAMS-VAE sparsifies these global latent variables for individual perturbations to identify disentangled, perturbation-specific latent subspaces that are flexibly composable. We evaluate SAMS-VAE both quantitatively and qualitatively on a range of tasks using two popular single cell sequencing datasets. In order to measure perturbation-specific model-properties, we also introduce a framework for evaluation of perturbation models based on average treatment effects with links to posterior predictive checks. SAMS-VAE outperforms comparable models in terms of generalization across in-distribution and out-of-distribution tasks, including a combinatorial reasoning task under resource paucity, and yields interpretable latent structures which correlate strongly to known biological mechanisms.

Current detection mechanisms are limited by their inability to address more covert backdoor strategies, such as style-based attacks. In this work, we propose an innovative test-time poisoned sample detection framework that hinges on the interpretability of model predictions, grounded in the semantic meaning of inputs. We contend that triggers (e.g., infrequent words) are not supposed to fundamentally alter the underlying semantic meanings of poisoned samples as they want to stay stealthy. Based on this observation, we hypothesize that while the model's predictions for paraphrased clean samples should remain stable, predictions for poisoned samples should revert to their true labels upon the mutations applied to triggers during the paraphrasing process. We employ ChatGPT, a state-of-the-art large language model, as our paraphraser and formulate the trigger-removal task as a prompt engineering problem. We adopt fuzzing, a technique commonly used for unearthing software vulnerabilities, to discover optimal paraphrase prompts that can effectively eliminate triggers while concurrently maintaining input semantics.

In this context, Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) have previously been used to represent and compress image and video content, demonstrating relatively high decoding speed compared to other methods. However, existing INR-based methods have failed to deliver rate quality performance comparable with the state of the art in video compression. This is mainly due to the simplicity of the employed network architectures, which limit their representation capability. In this paper, we propose HiNeRV, an INR that combines light weight layers with novel hierarchical positional encodings. We employs depth-wise convolutional, MLP and interpolation layers to build the deep and wide network architecture with high capacity. HiNeRV is also a unified representation encoding videos in both frames and patches at the same time, which offers higher performance and flexibility than existing methods. We further build a video codec based on HiNeRV and a refined pipeline for training, pruning and quantization that can better preserve HiNeRV's performance during lossy model compression.

Among others, this setting finds applications in forecasting competitions where the learner seeks not only to make predictions by aggregating different forecasters but also to rank them according to their relative performance. Our goal is to design algorithms that satisfy the following two requirements: 1) \\emph{Incentive-compatible}: Incentivize the experts to report their beliefs truthfully, and 2) \\emph{No-regret}: Achieve sublinear regret with respect to the true beliefs of the best fixed set of $m$ experts in hindsight. Prior works have studied this framework when $m=1$ and provided incentive-compatible no-regret algorithms for the problem. We first show that a simple reduction of our problem to the $m=1$ setting is neither efficient nor effective. Then, we provide algorithms that utilize the specific structure of the utility functions to achieve the two desired goals",

    "title": "ELDEN: Exploration via Local Dependencies",
    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "Tasks with large state space and sparse rewards present a longstanding challenge to reinforcement learning. In these tasks, an agent needs to explore the state space efficiently until it finds a reward. To deal with this problem, the community has proposed to augment the reward function with intrinsic reward, a bonus signal that encourages the agent to visit interesting states. In this work, we propose a new way of defining interesting states for environments with factored state spaces and complex chained dependencies, where an agent's actions may change the value of one entity that, in order, may affect the value of another entity. Our insight is that, in these environments, interesting states for exploration are states where the agent is uncertain whether (as opposed to how) entities such as the agent or objects have some influence on each other. We present ELDEN, Exploration via Local DepENdencies, a novel intrinsic reward that encourages the discovery of new interactions between entities. ELDEN utilizes a novel scheme --- the partial derivative of the learned dynamics to model the local dependencies between entities accurately and computationally efficiently. The uncertainty of the predicted dependencies is then used as an intrinsic reward to encourage exploration toward new interactions. We evaluate the performance of ELDEN on four different domains with complex dependencies, ranging from 2D grid worlds to 3D robotic tasks. In all domains, ELDEN correctly identifies local dependencies and learns successful policies, significantly outperforming previous state-of-the-art exploration methods",

    "title": "$H$-Consistency Bounds: Characterization and Extensions",
    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "A series of recent publications by Awasthi et al. have introduced the key notion of *$H$-consistency bounds* for surrogate loss functions. These are upper bounds on the zero-one estimation error of any predictor in a hypothesis set, expressed in terms of its surrogate loss estimation error. They are both non-asymptotic and hypothesis set-specific and thus stronger and more informative than Bayes-consistency. However, determining if they hold and deriving these bounds have required a specific proof and analysis for each surrogate loss. Can we derive more general tools and characterizations? This paper provides both a general characterization and an extension of $H$-consistency bounds for multi-class classification. We present new and tight $H$-consistency bounds for both the family of constrained losses and that of comp-sum losses, which covers the familiar cross-entropy, or logistic loss applied to the outputs of a neural network. We further extend our analysis beyond the completeness assumptions adopted in previous studies and cover more realistic bounded hypothesis sets. Our characterizations are based on error transformations, which are explicitly defined for each formulation. We illustrate the application of our general results through several special examples. A by-product of our analysis is the observation that a recently derived multi-class $H$-consistency bound for cross-entropy reduces to an excess bound and is not significant. Instead, we prove a much stronger and more significant guarantee",

However, the integration of many neural recordings into one unified model is challenging, as each recording contains the activity of different neurons from different individual animals. In this paper, we introduce a training framework and architecture designed to model the population dynamics of neural activity across diverse, large-scale neural recordings. Our method first tokenizes individual spikes within the dataset to build an efficient representation of neural events that captures the fine temporal structure of neural activity. We then employ cross-attention and a PerceiverIO backbone to further construct a latent tokenization of neural population activities. Utilizing this architecture and training framework, we construct a large-scale multi-session model trained on large datasets from seven nonhuman primates, spanning over 158 different sessions of recording from over 27,373 neural units and over 100 hours of recordings. In a number of different tasks, we demonstrate that our pretrained model can be rapidly adapted to new, unseen sessions with unspecified neuron correspondence, enabling few-shot performance with minimal labels.

To learn personalized models at scale, we propose a distributed algorithm that replaces the standard model averaging with model shuffling to simultaneously optimize PERM objectives for all devices. This also allows to learn distinct model architectures (e.g., neural networks with different number of parameters) for different clients, thus confining to underlying memory and compute resources of individual clients.

    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "Pretrained transformers exhibit the remarkable ability of in-context learning (ICL): they can learn tasks from just a few examples provided in the prompt without updating any weights. This raises a foundational question: can ICL solve fundamentally _new_ tasks that are very different from those seen during pretraining? To probe this question, we examine ICL's performance on linear regression while varying the diversity of tasks in the pretraining dataset. We empirically demonstrate a _task diversity threshold_ for the emergence of ICL. Below this threshold, the pretrained transformer cannot solve unseen regression tasks, instead behaving like a Bayesian estimator with the _non-diverse pretraining task distribution_ as the prior. Beyond this threshold, the transformer significantly outperforms this estimator; its behavior aligns with that of ridge regression, corresponding to a Gaussian prior over _all tasks_, including those not seen during pretraining. Thus, when pretrained on data with task diversity greater than the threshold, transformers _can_ optimally solve fundamentally new tasks in-context. Importantly, this capability hinges on it deviating from the Bayes optimal estimator with the pretraining distribution as the prior. This study also explores the effect of regularization, model capacity and task structure and underscores, in a concrete example, the critical role of task diversity, alongside data and model scale, in the emergence of ICL",

We show how this perspective naturally leads to a unified view on existing intrinsic reward approaches: they are special cases of conditional prediction, where the estimation of novelty can be seen as pseudo-likelihood estimation with different mask distributions. From this view, we propose a general framework for deriving intrinsic rewards -- Masked Input Modeling for Exploration (MIMEx) -- where the mask distribution can be flexibly tuned to control the difficulty of the underlying conditional prediction task.

We present BLEEP (Bi-modaL Embedding for Expression Prediction), a bi-modal embedding framework capable of generating spatially resolved gene expression profiles of whole-slide Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stained histology images.

While the existing literature focuses on maximizing group-balanced or worst-group accuracy, estimating these quantities is hindered by costly bias annotations. This study contends that current bias-unsupervised approaches to group robustness continue to rely on group information to achieve optimal performance. Firstly, these methods implicitly assume that all group combinations are represented during training. To illustrate this, we introduce a systematic generalization task on the MPI3D dataset and discover that current algorithms fail to improve the ERM baseline when combinations of observed attribute values are missing. Secondly, bias labels are still crucial for effective model selection, restricting the practicality of these methods in real-world scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose a revised methodology for training and validating debiased models in an entirely bias-unsupervised manner. We achieve this by employing pretrained self-supervised models to reliably extract bias information, which enables the integration of a logit adjustment training loss with our validation criterion. Our empirical analysis on synthetic and real-world tasks provides evidence that our approach overcomes the identified challenges and consistently enhances robust accuracy, attaining performance which is competitive with or outperforms that of state-of-the-art methods, which, conversely, rely on bias labels for validation",

    "title": "PAC-Bayes Generalization Certificates for Learned Inductive Conformal Prediction",
    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "Inductive Conformal Prediction (ICP) provides a practical and effective approach for equipping deep learning models with uncertainty estimates in the form of set-valued predictions which are guaranteed to contain the ground truth with high probability. Despite the appeal of this coverage guarantee, these sets may not be efficient: the size and contents of the prediction sets are not directly controlled, and instead depend on the underlying model and choice of score function. To remedy this, recent work has proposed learning model and score function parameters using data to directly optimize the efficiency of the ICP prediction sets. While appealing, the generalization theory for such an approach is lacking: direct optimization of empirical efficiency may yield prediction sets that are either no longer efficient on test data, or no longer obtain the required coverage on test data. In this work, we use PAC-Bayes theory to obtain generalization bounds on both the coverage and the efficiency of set-valued predictors which can be directly optimized to maximize efficiency while satisfying a desired test coverage. In contrast to prior work, our framework allows us to utilize the entire calibration dataset to learn the parameters of the model and score function, instead of requiring a separate hold-out set for obtaining test-time coverage guarantees. We leverage these theoretical results to provide a practical algorithm for using calibration data to simultaneously fine-tune the parameters of a model and score function while guaranteeing test-time coverage and efficiency of the resulting prediction sets. We evaluate the approach on regression and classification tasks, and outperform baselines calibrated using a Hoeffding bound-based PAC guarantee on ICP, especially in the low-data regime",

    "abstract": "Conformal inference provides a general distribution-free method to rigorously calibrate the output of any machine learning algorithm for novelty detection. While this approach has many strengths, it has the limitation of being randomized, in the sense that it may lead to different results when analyzing twice the same data and this can hinder the interpretation of any findings. We propose to make conformal inferences more stable by leveraging suitable conformal e-values instead of p-values to quantify statistical significance. This solution allows the evidence gathered from multiple analyses of the same data to be aggregated effectively while provably controlling the false discovery rate. Further, we show that the proposed method can reduce randomness without much loss of power compared to standard conformal inference, partly thanks to an innovative way of weighting conformal e-values based on additional side information carefully extracted from the same data. Simulations with synthetic and real data confirm this solution can be effective at eliminating random noise in the inferences obtained with state-of-the-art alternative techniques, sometimes also leading to higher power",

    "abstract": "Data shift is a phenomenon present in many real-world applications, and while there are multiple methods attempting to detect shifts, the task of localizing and correcting the features originating such shifts has not been studied in depth. Feature shifts can occur in many datasets, including in multi-sensor data, where some sensors are malfunctioning, or in tabular and structured data, including biomedical, financial, and survey data, where faulty standardization and data processing pipelines can lead to erroneous features. In this work, we explore using the principles of adversarial learning, where the information from several discriminators trained to distinguish between two distributions is used to both detect the corrupted features and fix them in order to remove the distribution shift between datasets. We show that mainstream supervised classifiers, such as random forest or gradient boosting trees, combined with simple iterative heuristics, can localize and correct feature shifts, outperforming current statistical and neural network-based techniques.

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) can learn to perform a wide range of natural language tasks from just a handful of in-context examples. However, for generating strings from highly structured languages (e.g., semantic parsing to complex domain-specific languages), it is challenging for the LLM to generalize from just a few exemplars. We propose \\emph{grammar prompting}, a simple approach to enable LLMs to use external knowledge and domain-specific constraints, expressed through a grammar in Backus--Naur Form (BNF), during in-context learning. Grammar prompting augments each demonstration example with a specialized grammar that is minimally sufficient for generating the particular output example, where the specialized grammar is a subset of the full DSL grammar. For inference, the LLM first predicts a BNF grammar given a test input, and then generates the output according to the rules of the grammar. Experiments demonstrate that grammar prompting can enable LLMs to perform competitively on a diverse set of DSL generation tasks, including semantic parsing (SMCalFlow, Overnight, GeoQuery), PDDL planning, and SMILES-based molecule generation",

We then perform an empirical study on a synthetic regression task to investigate the implicit bias of GN's method. While GN is consistently faster than GD in finding a global optimum, the learned model generalizes well on test data when starting from random initial weights with a small variance and using a small step size to slow down convergence. Specifically, our study shows that such a setting results in a hidden learning phenomenon, where the dynamics are able to recover features with good generalization properties despite the model having sub-optimal training and test performances due to an under-optimized linear layer.

    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "Finding tight linear bounds for activation functions in neural networks is an essential part of several state of the art neural network robustness certification tools. An activation function is an arbitrary, nonlinear, scalar function $f: \\mathbb{R}^d \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$. In the existing work on robustness certification, such bounds have been computed using human ingenuity for a handful of the most popular activation functions. While a number of heuristics have been proposed for bounding arbitrary functions, no analysis of the tightness optimality for general scalar functions has been offered yet, to the best of our knowledge. We fill this gap by formulating a concise optimality criterion for tightness of the approximation which allows us to build optimal bounds for any function convex in the region of interest $R$. For a more general class of functions Lipshitz-continuous in $R$ we propose a sampling-based approach (SOL) which, given an instance of the bounding problem, efficiently computes the tightest linear bounds within a given $\\varepsilon > 0$ threshold. We leverage an adaptive sampling technique to iteratively build a set of sample points suitable for representing the target activation function. While the theoretical worst case time complexity of our approach is $O(\\varepsilon^{-2d})$, it typically only takes $O(\\log^{\\beta} \\frac{1}{\\varepsilon})$ time for some $\\beta \\ge 1$ and is thus sufficiently fast in practice. We provide empirical evidence of SOL's practicality by incorporating it into a robustness certifier and observing that it produces similar or higher certification rates while taking as low as quarter of the time compared to the other methods",

In such situations, the successor representation (SR) is a popular framework which supports rapid policy evaluation by decoupling a policy's expected discounted, cumulative state occupancies from a specific reward function. However, in the natural world, sequential tasks are rarely independent, and instead reflect shifting priorities based on the availability and subjective perception of rewarding stimuli. Reflecting this disjunction, in this paper we study the phenomenon of diminishing marginal utility and introduce a novel state representation, the $\\lambda$ representation ($\\lambda$R) which, surprisingly, is required for policy evaluation in this setting and which generalizes the SR as well as several other state representations from the literature.

We propose to replace the marginal rank test with a flexible classification approach that learns test statistics from data. This measure typically has a higher statistical power than the SBC test and returns an interpretable divergence measure of miscalibration, computed from classification accuracy. This approach can be used with different data generating processes to address simulation-based inference or traditional inference methods like Markov chain Monte Carlo or variational inference.

    "title": "Online POMDP Planning with Anytime Deterministic Guarantees",
    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "Autonomous agents operating in real-world scenarios frequently encounter uncertainty and make decisions based on incomplete information. Planning under uncertainty can be mathematically formalized using partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs). However, finding an optimal plan for POMDPs can be computationally expensive and is feasible only for small tasks. In recent years, approximate algorithms, such as tree search and sample-based methodologies, have emerged as state-of-the-art POMDP solvers for larger problems. Despite their effectiveness, these algorithms offer only probabilistic and often asymptotic guarantees toward the optimal solution due to their dependence on sampling. To address these limitations, we derive a deterministic relationship between a simplified solution that is easier to obtain and the theoretically optimal one. First, we derive bounds for selecting a subset of the observations to branch from while computing a complete belief at each posterior node. Then, since a complete belief update may be computationally demanding, we extend the bounds to support reduction of both the state and the observation spaces. We demonstrate how our guarantees can be integrated with existing state-of-the-art solvers that sample a subset of states and observations. As a result, the returned solution holds deterministic bounds relative to the optimal policy. Lastly, we substantiate our findings with supporting experimental results",

    "abstract": "Imitation Learning (IL) is a widely used framework for learning imitative behavior from demonstrations. It is especially appealing for solving complex real-world tasks where handcrafting reward function is difficult, or when the goal is to mimic human expert behavior. However, the learned imitative policy can only follow the behavior in the demonstration. When applying the imitative policy, we may need to customize the policy behavior to meet different requirements coming from diverse downstream tasks. Meanwhile, we still want the customized policy to maintain its imitative nature. To this end, we formulate a new problem setting called policy customization. It defines the learning task as training a policy that inherits the characteristics of the prior policy while satisfying some additional requirements imposed by a target downstream task. We propose a novel and principled approach to interpret and determine the trade-off between the two task objectives. Specifically, we formulate the customization problem as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) with a reward function that combines 1) the inherent reward of the demonstration; and 2) the add-on reward specified by the downstream task. We propose a novel framework, Residual Q-learning, which can solve the formulated MDP by leveraging the prior policy without knowing the inherent reward or value function of the prior policy. We derive a family of residual Q-learning algorithms that can realize offline and online policy customization, and show that the proposed algorithms can effectively accomplish policy customization tasks in various environments.

To address this, new label-sets and evaluation protocols have been proposed for ImageNet showing that state-of-the-art models already achieve over 95% accuracy and shifting the focus on investigating why the remaining errors persist. Recent work in this direction employed a panel of experts to manually categorize all remaining classification errors for two selected models. However, this process is time-consuming, prone to inconsistencies, and requires trained experts, making it unsuitable for regular model evaluation thus limiting its utility. To overcome these limitations, we propose the first automated error classification framework, a valuable tool to study how modeling choices affect error distributions. We use our framework to comprehensively evaluate the error distribution of over 900 models. Perhaps surprisingly, we find that across model architectures, scales, and pre-training corpora, top-1 accuracy is a strong predictor for the *portion* of all error types. In particular, we observe that the portion of severe errors drops significantly with top-1 accuracy indicating that, while it underreports a model's true performance, it remains a valuable performance metric.

The framework consists of three stages: estimating pairwise intensity functions, e.g. via kernel smoothing; learning a projection which minimises a notion of intensity reconstruction error; and constructing evolving node representations via the learned projection. The trajectories satisfy two properties, known as structural and temporal coherence, which we see as fundamental for reliable inference. Moreoever, we develop estimation theory providing tight control on the error of any estimated trajectory, indicating that the representations could even be used in quite noise-sensitive follow-on analyses. The theory also elucidates the role of smoothing as a bias-variance trade-off, and shows how we can reduce the level of smoothing as the signal-to-noise ratio increases on account of the algorithm `borrowing strength' across the network",

    "title": "High Precision Causal Model Evaluation with Conditional Randomization",
    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "The gold standard for causal model evaluation involves comparing model predictions with true effects estimated from randomized controlled trials (RCT). However, RCTs are not always feasible or ethical to perform. In contrast, conditionally randomized experiments based on inverse probability weighting (IPW) offer a more realistic approach but may suffer from high estimation variance. To tackle this challenge and enhance causal model evaluation in real-world conditional randomization settings, we introduce a novel low-variance estimator for causal error, dubbed as the pairs estimator. By applying the same IPW estimator to both the model and true experimental effects, our estimator effectively cancels out the variance due to IPW and achieves a smaller asymptotic variance. Empirical studies demonstrate the improved of our estimator, highlighting its potential on achieving near-RCT performance. Our method offers a simple yet powerful solution to evaluate causal inference models in conditional randomization settings without complicated modification of the IPW estimator itself, paving the way for more robust and reliable model assessments",

    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "A potent class of generative models known as Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DPMs) has become prominent. A forward diffusion process adds gradually noise to data, while a model learns to gradually denoise. Sampling from pre-trained DPMs is obtained by solving differential equations (DE) defined by the learnt model, a process which has shown to be prohibitively slow. Numerous efforts on speeding-up this process have consisted on crafting powerful ODE solvers. Despite being quick, such solvers do not usually reach the optimal quality achieved by available slow SDE solvers. Our goal is to propose SDE solvers that reach optimal quality without requiring several hundreds or thousands of NFEs to achieve that goal. We propose Stochastic Explicit Exponential Derivative-free Solvers (SEEDS), improving and generalizing Exponential Integrator approaches to the stochastic case on several frameworks. After carefully analyzing the formulation of exact solutions of diffusion SDEs, we craft SEEDS to analytically compute the linear part of such solutions. Inspired by the Exponential Time-Differencing method, SEEDS use a novel treatment of the stochastic components of solutions, enabling the analytical computation of their variance, and contains high-order terms allowing to reach optimal quality sampling $\\sim3$-$5\\times$ faster than previous SDE methods. We validate our approach on several image generation benchmarks, showing that SEEDS outperform or are competitive with previous SDE solvers. Contrary to the latter, SEEDS are derivative and training free, and we fully prove strong convergence guarantees for them",

    "abstract": "Learning cause and effect relations is arguably one of the central challenges found throughout the data sciences. Formally, determining whether a collection of observational and interventional distributions can be combined to learn a target causal relation is known as the problem of generalized identification (or g-identification) [Lee et al., 2019]. Although g-identification has been well understood and solved in theory, it turns out to be challenging to apply these results in practice, in particular when considering the estimation of the target distribution from finite samples. In this paper, we develop a new, general estimator that exhibits multiply robustness properties for g-identifiable causal functionals. Specifically, we show that any g-identifiable causal effect can be expressed as a function of generalized multi-outcome sequential back-door adjustments that are amenable to estimation. We then construct a corresponding estimator for the g-identification expression that exhibits robustness properties to bias. We analyze the asymptotic convergence properties of the estimator. Finally, we illustrate the use of the proposed estimator in experimental studies. Simulation results corroborate the theory",

To tackle these limitations, we propose a new uncertainty-aware fairness -- Equal Opportunity of Coverage (EOC) -- that aims to achieve two properties: (1) coverage rates for different groups with similar outcomes are close, and (2) the coverage rate for the entire population remains at a predetermined level. Further, the prediction intervals should be narrow to be informative. We propose Binned Fair Quantile Regression (BFQR), a distribution-free post-processing method to improve EOC with reasonable width for any trained ML models. It first calibrates a hold-out set to bound deviation from EOC, then leverages conformal prediction to maintain EOC on a test set, meanwhile optimizing prediction interval width.

    "abstract": "We study the problem of computing an optimal policy of an infinite-horizon discounted constrained Markov decision process (constrained MDP). Despite the popularity of Lagrangian-based policy search methods used in practice, the oscillation of policy iterates in these methods has not been fully understood, bringing out issues such as violation of constraints and sensitivity to hyper-parameters. To fill this gap, we employ the Lagrangian method to cast a constrained MDP into a constrained saddle-point problem in which max/min players correspond to primal/dual variables, respectively, and develop two single-time-scale policy-based primal-dual algorithms with non-asymptotic convergence of their policy iterates to an optimal constrained policy. Specifically, we first propose a regularized policy gradient primal-dual (RPG-PD) method that updates the policy using an entropy-regularized policy gradient, and the dual variable via a quadratic-regularized gradient ascent, simultaneously. We prove that the policy primal-dual iterates of RPG-PD converge to a regularized saddle point with a sublinear rate, while the policy iterates converge sublinearly to an optimal constrained policy. We further instantiate RPG-PD in large state or action spaces by including function approximation in policy parametrization, and establish similar sublinear last-iterate policy convergence. Second, we propose an optimistic policy gradient primal-dual (OPG-PD) method that employs the optimistic gradient method to update primal/dual variables, simultaneously. We prove that the policy primal-dual iterates of OPG-PD converge to a saddle point that contains an optimal constrained policy, with a linear rate. To the best of our knowledge, this work appears to be the first non-asymptotic policy last-iterate convergence result for single-time-scale algorithms in constrained MDPs.

Given the inherent transitivity of ranking, we explore differentiable sorting networks as a means to introduce a stronger transitive inductive bias during optimization. Despite their potential, current differentiable sorting methods cannot account for censoring, a crucial aspect of many real-world datasets. We propose a novel method, Diffsurv, to overcome this limitation by extending differentiable sorting methods to handle censored tasks. Diffsurv predicts matrices of possible permutations that accommodate the label uncertainty introduced by censored samples. Our experiments reveal that Diffsurv outperforms established baselines in various simulated and real-world risk prediction scenarios.

PAM is interpretable to identify important interactions in predicting a target. Theoretic analysis shows that PAM has stronger expression capability than ReLU-activated networks.

    "abstract": "Object detection models are vulnerable to backdoor or trojan attacks, where an attacker can inject malicious triggers into the model, leading to altered behavior during inference. As a defense mechanism, trigger inversion leverages optimization to reverse-engineer triggers and identify compromised models. While existing trigger inversion methods assume that each instance from the support set is equally affected by the injected trigger, we observe that the poison effect can vary significantly across bounding boxes in object detection models due to its dense prediction nature, leading to an undesired optimization objective misalignment issue for existing trigger reverse-engineering methods. To address this challenge, we propose the first object detection backdoor detection framework Django (Detecting Trojans in Object Detection Models via Gaussian Focus Calibration). It leverages a dynamic Gaussian weighting scheme that prioritizes more vulnerable victim boxes and assigns appropriate coefficients to calibrate the optimization objective during trigger inversion. In addition, we combine Django with a novel label proposal pre-processing technique to enhance its efficiency.

An ideal neural network architecture for such tasks would leverage the fact that objects can be rotated and translated in three dimensions to make predictions about novel images. However, imposing $SO(3)$-equivariance on two-dimensional inputs is difficult because the group of three-dimensional rotations does not have a natural action on the two-dimensional plane. Specifically, it is possible that an element of $SO(3)$ will rotate an image out of plane. We show that an algorithm that learns a three-dimensional representation of the world from two dimensional images must satisfy certain consistency properties which we formulate as $SO(2)$-equivariance constraints. We use the induced representation of $SO(2)$ on $SO(3)$ to construct and classify architectures that have two-dimensional inputs and which satisfy these consistency constraints. We prove that any architecture which respects said consistency constraints can be realized as an instance of our construction. We show that three previously proposed neural architectures for 3D pose prediction are special cases of our construction.

Consequently, it is still unknown how natural visual input and different behavioral variables may integrate over time to generate responses in primary visual cortex (V1). To address this, we introduce a multimodal recurrent neural network that integrates gaze-contingent visual input with behavioral and temporal dynamics to explain V1 activity in freely moving mice. We show that the model achieves state-of-the-art predictions of V1 activity during free exploration and demonstrate the importance of each component in an extensive ablation study. Analyzing our model using maximally activating stimuli and saliency maps, we reveal new insights into cortical function, including the prevalence of mixed selectivity for behavioral variables in mouse V1.

In this work, we show how this can be done without test-domain labels. In particular, we prove that pseudo-labels based on stable features provide sufficient guidance for doing so, provided that stable and unstable features are conditionally independent given the label. Based on this theoretical insight, we propose Stable Feature Boosting (SFB), an algorithm for: (i) learning a predictor that separates stable and conditionally-independent unstable features; and (ii) using the stable-feature predictions to adapt the unstable-feature predictions in the test domain.

This model holds considerable practical utility because it can represent periodicity, including common occurrences such as seasonality and diurnal variation. We propose a constraint-based, non-parametric algorithm for discovering causal relations in this setting. The resulting algorithm, PCMCI$_{\\Omega}$, can capture the alternating and recurring changes in the causal mechanisms and then identify the underlying causal graph with conditional independence (CI) tests.

The flow matching generative decoder uses the speaker-conditional output to synthesize high-quality personalized speech significantly faster than in real-time. Unlike the neural codec language models, we specifically train P-Flow on LibriTTS dataset using a continuous mel-representation. Through our training method using continuous speech prompts, P-Flow matches the speaker similarity performance of the large-scale zero-shot TTS models with two orders of magnitude less training data and has more than 20$\\times$ faster sampling speed. Our results show that P-Flow has better pronunciation and is preferred in human likeness and speaker similarity to its recent state-of-the-art counterparts, thus defining P-Flow as an attractive and desirable alternative.

    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "In a backdoor attack, an adversary injects corrupted data into a model's training dataset in order to gain control over its predictions on images with a specific attacker-defined trigger. A typical corrupted training example requires altering both the image, by applying the trigger, and the label. Models trained on clean images, therefore, were considered safe from backdoor attacks. However, in some common machine learning scenarios, the training labels are provided by potentially malicious third-parties. This includes crowd-sourced annotation and knowledge distillation. We, hence, investigate a fundamental question: can we launch a successful backdoor attack by only corrupting labels? We introduce a novel approach to design label-only backdoor attacks, which we call FLIP, and demonstrate its strengths on three datasets (CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Tiny-ImageNet) and four architectures (ResNet-32, ResNet-18, VGG-19, and Vision Transformer). With only 2% of CIFAR-10 labels corrupted, FLIP achieves a near-perfect attack success rate of 99.4% while suffering only a 1.8% drop in the clean test accuracy. Our approach builds upon the recent advances in trajectory matching, originally introduced for dataset distillation",

    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "Goal-conditioned reinforcement learning (RL) is a powerful approach for learning general-purpose skills by reaching diverse goals. However, it has limitations when it comes to task-conditioned policies, where goals are specified by temporally extended instructions written in the Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) formal language. Existing approaches for finding LTL-satisfying policies rely on sampling a large set of LTL instructions during training to adapt to unseen tasks at inference time. However, these approaches do not guarantee generalization to out-of-distribution LTL objectives, which may have increased complexity. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to address this challenge. We show that simple goal-conditioned RL agents can be instructed to follow arbitrary LTL specifications without additional training over the LTL task space. Unlike existing approaches that focus on LTL specifications expressible as regular expressions, our technique is unrestricted and generalizes to $\\omega$-regular expressions. Experiment results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in adapting goal-conditioned RL agents to satisfy complex temporal logic task specifications zero-shot",

    "abstract": "Equivariant networks are specifically designed to ensure consistent behavior with respect to a set of input transformations, leading to higher sample efficiency and more accurate and robust predictions. However, redesigning each component of prevalent deep neural network architectures to achieve chosen equivariance is a difficult problem and can result in a computationally expensive network during both training and inference. A recently proposed alternative towards equivariance that removes the architectural constraints is to use a simple canonicalization network that transforms the input to a canonical form before feeding it to an unconstrained prediction network. We show here that this approach can effectively be used to make a large pretrained network equivariant. However, we observe that the produced canonical orientations can be misaligned with those of the training distribution, hindering performance. Using dataset-dependent priors to inform the canonicalization function, we are able to make large pretrained models equivariant while maintaining their performance. This significantly improves the robustness of these models to deterministic transformations of the data, such as rotations. We believe this equivariant adaptation of large pretrained models can help their domain-specific applications with known symmetry priors",

However, adversarial users can construct inputs which circumvent attempts at alignment. In this work, we study adversarial alignment, and ask to what extent these models remain aligned when interacting with an adversarial user who constructs worst-case inputs (adversarial examples). These inputs are designed to cause the model to emit harmful content that would otherwise be prohibited. We show that existing NLP-based optimization attacks are insufficiently powerful to reliably attack aligned text models: even when current NLP-based attacks fail, we can find adversarial inputs with brute force. As a result, the failure of current attacks should not be seen as proof that aligned text models remain aligned under adversarial inputs. However the recent trend in large-scale ML models is multimodal models that allow users to provide images that influence the text that is generated. We show these models can be easily attacked, i.e., induced to perform arbitrary un-aligned behavior through adversarial perturbation of the input image. We conjecture that improved NLP attacks may demonstrate this same level of adversarial control over text-only models",

Despite the impressive breakthroughs made by geometric deep learning in various molecular representation learning tasks, effectively capturing complicated geometric features across spatial dimensions is still underexplored due to the significant difficulties in modeling efficient geometric representations and learning the inherent correlation in 3D structural modeling. These include computational inefficiency, underutilization of vectorial embeddings, and limited generalizability to integrate various geometric properties. To address the raised concerns, we introduce an efficient and effective framework, Scalable Vector Network (SaVeNet), designed to accommodate a range of geometric requirements without depending on costly embeddings. In addition, the proposed framework scales effectively with introduced direction noise. Theoretically, we analyze the desired properties (i.e., invariance and equivariant) and framework efficiency of the SaVeNet. Empirically, we conduct a comprehensive series of experiments to evaluate the efficiency and expressiveness of the proposed model. Our efficiency-focused experiments underscore the model's empirical superiority over existing methods.

While previous methods successfully meta-learn either a surrogate model or an acquisition function independently, joint training of both components remains an open challenge. This paper proposes the first end-to-end differentiable meta-BO framework that generalises neural processes to learn acquisition functions via transformer architectures. We enable this end-to-end framework with reinforcement learning (RL) to tackle the lack of labelled acquisition data. Early on, we notice that training transformer-based neural processes from scratch with RL is challenging due to insufficient supervision, especially when rewards are sparse. We formalise this claim with a combinatorial analysis showing that the widely used notion of regret as a reward signal exhibits a logarithmic sparsity pattern in trajectory lengths. To tackle this problem, we augment the RL objective with an auxiliary task that guides part of the architecture to learn a valid probabilistic model as an inductive bias. We demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art regret results against various baselines in experiments on standard hyperparameter optimisation tasks and also outperforms others in the real-world problems of mixed-integer programming tuning, antibody design, and logic synthesis for electronic design automation",

    "abstract": "Transformer-based language models have found many diverse applications requiring them to process sequences of increasing length. For these applications, the causal self-attention---which is the only component scaling quadratically w.r.t. the sequence length---becomes a central concern. While many works have proposed schemes to sparsify the attention patterns and reduce the computational overhead of self-attention, those are often limited by implementation concerns and end up imposing a simple and static structure over the attention matrix. Conversely, implementing more dynamic sparse attention often results in runtimes significantly slower than computing the full attention using the Flash implementation from Dao et al. (2022). We extend FlashAttention to accommodate a large class of attention sparsity patterns that, in particular, encompass key/query dropping and hashing-based attention. This leads to implementations with no computational complexity overhead and a multi-fold runtime speedup on top of FlashAttention. Even with relatively low degrees of sparsity, our method improves visibly upon FlashAttention as the sequence length increases. Without sacrificing perplexity, we increase the training speed of a transformer language model by $2.0\\times$ and $3.3\\times$ for sequences of respectively $8k$ and $16k$ tokens",

By leveraging pre-trained vision-language models, we can efficiently identify common visual attributes of underperforming data slices using human-understandable terms.

A large number of literature relies on uncertainty quantification to evaluate the reliability of a learning model, which is particularly important for applications of out-of-distribution (OOD) detection and misclassification detection.

We start our analysis based on graph posterior networks (GPNs) that optimize the uncertainty cross-entropy (UCE)-based loss function. We describe the theoretical limitations of the widely-used UCE loss. To alleviate the identified drawbacks, we propose a distance-based regularization that encourages clustered OOD nodes to remain clustered in the latent space.

Previous approaches to data pre-selection relied solely on visual features extracted from foundation models, such as CLIP and BLIP-2, but largely ignored the powerfulness of text features. In this work, we argue that, with proper design, the joint feature space of both vision and text can yield a better representation for data pre-selection. To this end, we introduce UP-DP, a simple yet effective unsupervised prompt learning approach that adapts vision-language models, like BLIP-2, for data pre-selection. Specifically, with the BLIP-2 parameters frozen, we train text prompts to extract the joint features with improved representation, ensuring a diverse cluster structure that covers the entire dataset. We extensively compare our method with the state-of-the-art using seven benchmark datasets in different settings, achieving up to a performance gain of 20\\%. Interestingly, the prompts learned from one dataset demonstrate significant generalizability and can be applied directly to enhance the feature extraction of BLIP-2 from other datasets.

    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "Hedonic Games (HGs) are a classical framework modeling coalition formation of strategic agents guided by their individual preferences. According to these preferences, it is desirable that a coalition structure (i.e. a partition of agents into coalitions) satisfies some form of stability. The most well-known and natural of such notions is arguably core-stability. Informally, a partition is core-stable if no subset of agents would like to deviate by regrouping in a so-called core-blocking coalition. Unfortunately, core-stable partitions seldom exist and even when they do, it is often computationally intractable to find one. To circumvent these problems, we propose the notion of $\\varepsilon$-fractional core-stability, where at most an $\\varepsilon$-fraction of all possible coalitions is allowed to core-block. It turns out that such a relaxation may guarantee both existence and polynomial-time computation. Specifically, we design efficient algorithms returning an $\\varepsilon$-fractional core-stable partition, with $\\varepsilon$ exponentially decreasing in the number of agents, for two fundamental classes of HGs: Simple Fractional and Anonymous. From a probabilistic point of view, being the definition of $\\varepsilon$-fractional core equivalent to requiring that uniformly sampled coalitions core-block with probability lower than $\\varepsilon$, we further extend the definition to handle more complex sampling distributions. Along this line, when valuations have to be learned from samples in a PAC-learning fashion, we give positive and negative results on which distributions allow the efficient computation of outcomes that are $\\varepsilon$-fractional core-stable with arbitrarily high confidence",

    "abstract": "Changes in the data distribution at test time can have deleterious effects on the performance of predictive models $p(y|x)$. We consider situations where there are additional meta-data labels (such as group labels), denoted by $z$, that can account for such changes in the distribution. In particular, we assume that the prior distribution $p(y,z)$, which models the dependence between the class label $y$ and the \"nuisance\" factors $z$, may change across domains, either due to a change in the correlation between these terms, or a change in one of their marginals. However, we assume that the generative model for features $p(x|y,z)$ is invariant across domains. We note that this corresponds to an expanded version of the widely used \"label shift\" assumption, where the labels now also include the nuisance factors $z$. Based on this observation, we propose a test-time label shift correction that adapts to changes in the joint distribution $p(y, z)$ using EM applied to unlabeled samples from the target domain distribution, $p_t(x)$. Importantly, we are able to avoid fitting a generative model $p(x|y,z)$, and merely need to reweight the outputs of a discriminative model $p_s(y,z|x)$ trained on the source distribution. We evaluate our method, which we call \"Test-Time Label-Shift Adaptation\" (TTLSA), on several standard image and text datasets, as well as the CheXpert chest X-ray dataset, and show that it improves performance over methods that target invariance to changes in the distribution, as well as baseline empirical risk minimization methods.

    "abstract": "Finetuning language models with reinforcement learning (RL), e.g. from human feedback (HF), is a prominent method for alignment. But optimizing against a reward model can improve on reward while degrading performance in other areas, a phenomenon known as reward hacking, alignment tax, or language drift. First, we argue that commonly-used test metrics are insufficient and instead measure how different algorithms tradeoff between reward and drift. The standard method modified the reward with a Kullback-Lieber (KL) penalty between the online and initial model. We propose Elastic Reset, a new algorithm that achieves higher reward with less drift without explicitly modifying the training objective. We periodically reset the online model to an exponentially moving average (EMA) of itself, then reset the EMA model to the initial model. Through the use of an EMA, our model recovers quickly after resets and achieves higher reward with less drift in the same number of steps. We demonstrate that fine-tuning language models with Elastic Reset leads to state-of-the-art performance on a small scale pivot-translation benchmark, outperforms all baselines in a medium-scale RLHF-like IMDB mock sentiment task and leads to a more performant and more aligned technical QA chatbot with LLaMA-7B.

Using the decorrelation lemma in combination with other techniques, such as symmetrization, couplings, and chaining in the space of probability measures, we obtain new upper bounds on the generalization error, both in expectation and in high probability, and recover as special cases many of the existing generalization bounds, including the ones based on mutual information, conditional mutual information, stochastic chaining, and PAC-Bayes inequalities.

    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "How does a single interconnected neural population perform multiple tasks, each with its own dynamical requirements? The relation between task requirements and neural dynamics in Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) has been investigated for single tasks. The forces shaping joint dynamics of multiple tasks, however, are largely unexplored. In this work, we first construct a systematic framework to study multiple tasks in RNNs, minimizing interference from input and output correlations with the hidden representation. This allows us to reveal how RNNs tend to share attractors and reuse dynamics, a tendency we define as the \"simplicity bias\". We find that RNNs develop attractors sequentially during training, preferentially reusing existing dynamics and opting for simple solutions when possible. This sequenced emergence and preferential reuse encapsulate the simplicity bias. Through concrete examples, we demonstrate that new attractors primarily emerge due to task demands or architectural constraints, illustrating a balance between simplicity bias and external factors. We examine the geometry of joint representations within a single attractor, by constructing a family of tasks from a set of functions. We show that the steepness of the associated functions controls their alignment within the attractor. This arrangement again highlights the simplicity bias, as points with similar input spacings undergo comparable transformations to reach the shared attractor. Our findings propose compelling applications. The geometry of shared attractors might allow us to infer the nature of unknown tasks. Furthermore, the simplicity bias implies that without specific incentives, modularity in RNNs may not spontaneously emerge, providing insights into the conditions required for network specialization",

    "abstract": "By now Bayesian methods are routinely used in practice for solving inverse problems. In inverse problems the parameter or signal of interest is observed only indirectly, as an image of a given map, and the observations are typically further corrupted with noise. Bayes offers a natural way to regularize these problems via the prior distribution and provides a probabilistic solution, quantifying the remaining uncertainty in the problem. However, the computational costs of standard, sampling based Bayesian approaches can be overly large in such complex models. Therefore, in practice variational Bayes is becoming increasingly popular. Nevertheless, the theoretical understanding of these methods is still relatively limited, especially in context of inverse problems. In our analysis we investigate variational Bayesian methods for Gaussian process priors to solve linear inverse problems. We consider both mildly and severely ill-posed inverse problems and work with the popular inducing variable variational Bayes approach proposed by Titsias [Titsias, 2009]. We derive posterior contraction rates for the variational posterior in general settings and show that the minimax estimation rate can be attained by correctly tunned procedures. As specific examples we consider a collection of inverse problems including the heat equation, Volterra operator and Radon transform and inducing variable methods based on population and empirical spectral features",

    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "Fine-tuning vision-language models (VLMs) like CLIP to downstream tasks is often necessary to optimize their performance. However, a major obstacle is the limited availability of labeled data. We study the use of pseudolabels, i.e., heuristic labels for unlabeled data, to enhance CLIP via prompt tuning. Conventional pseudolabeling trains a model on labeled data and then generates labels for unlabeled data. VLMs' zero-shot capabilities enable a ``second generation'' of pseudolabeling approaches that do not require task-specific training on labeled data. By using zero-shot pseudolabels as a source of supervision, we observe that learning paradigms such as semi-supervised, transductive zero-shot, and unsupervised learning can all be seen as optimizing the same loss function. This unified view enables the development of versatile training strategies that are applicable across learning paradigms. We investigate them on image classification tasks where CLIP exhibits limitations, by varying prompt modalities, e.g., textual or visual prompts, and learning paradigms. We find that (1) unexplored prompt tuning strategies that iteratively refine pseudolabels consistently improve CLIP accuracy, by 19.5 points in semi-supervised learning, by 28.4 points in transductive zero-shot learning, and by 15.2 points in unsupervised learning, and (2) unlike conventional semi-supervised pseudolabeling, which exacerbates model biases toward classes with higher-quality pseudolabels, prompt tuning leads to a more equitable distribution of per-class accuracy.

    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "The recently proposed stochastic Polyak stepsize (SPS) and stochastic line-search (SLS) for SGD have shown remarkable effectiveness when training over-parameterized models. However, two issues remain unsolved in this line of work. First, in non-interpolation settings, both algorithms only guarantee convergence to a neighborhood of a solution which may result in a worse output than the initial guess. While artificially decreasing the adaptive stepsize has been proposed to address this issue (Orvieto et al.), this approach results in slower convergence rates under interpolation. Second, intuitive line-search methods equipped with variance-reduction (VR) fail to converge (Dubois-Taine et al.). So far, no VR methods successfully accelerate these two stepsizes with a convergence guarantee. In this work, we make two contributions: Firstly, we propose two new robust variants of SPS and SLS, called AdaSPS and AdaSLS, which achieve optimal asymptotic rates in both strongly-convex or convex and interpolation or non-interpolation settings, except for the case when we have both strong convexity and non-interpolation. AdaSLS requires no knowledge of problem-dependent parameters, and AdaSPS requires only a lower bound of the optimal function value as input. Secondly, we propose a novel VR method that can use Polyak stepsizes or line-search to achieve acceleration. When it is equipped with AdaSPS or AdaSLS, the resulting algorithms obtain the optimal rate for optimizing convex smooth functions. Finally, numerical experiments on synthetic and real datasets validate our theory and demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our algorithms",

Specifically, we assume access to a noisy oracle for the stochastic gradient of $f$ at $x$, which returns a vector $\\nabla f(\\gamma, x) + \\xi$, where $\\gamma$ is the bounded variance observation noise and $\\xi$ is the oblivious noise that is independent of $\\gamma$ and $x$.

We propose message passing networks based on these features and evaluate their performance on a variety of node and graph property prediction tasks.

    "abstract": "Humans solving algorithmic (or) reasoning problems typically exhibit solution times that grow as a function of problem difficulty. Adaptive recurrent neural networks have been shown to exhibit this property for various language-processing tasks. However, little work has been performed to assess whether such adaptive computation can also enable vision models to extrapolate solutions beyond their training distribution's difficulty level, with prior work focusing on very simple tasks. In this study, we investigate a critical functional role of such adaptive processing using recurrent neural networks: to dynamically scale computational resources conditional on input requirements that allow for zero-shot generalization to novel difficulty levels not seen during training using two challenging visual reasoning tasks: PathFinder and Mazes. We combine convolutional recurrent neural networks (ConvRNNs) with a learnable halting mechanism based on Graves (2016). We explore various implementations of such adaptive ConvRNNs (AdRNNs) ranging from tying weights across layers to more sophisticated biologically inspired recurrent networks that possess lateral connections and gating. We show that 1) AdRNNs learn to dynamically halt processing early (or late) to solve easier (or harder) problems, 2) these RNNs zero-shot generalize to more difficult problem settings not shown during training by dynamically increasing the number of recurrent iterations at test time. Our study provides modeling evidence supporting the hypothesis that recurrent processing enables the functional advantage of adaptively allocating compute resources conditional on input requirements and hence allowing generalization to harder difficulty levels of a visual reasoning problem without training",

Therefore, it becomes increasingly important to study the properties of human texts that are invariant over text domains and various proficiency of human writers, can be easily calculated for any language, and can robustly separate natural and AI-generated texts regardless of the generation model and sampling method. In this work, we propose such an invariant of human texts, namely the intrinsic dimensionality of the manifold underlying the set of embeddings of a given text sample. We show that the average intrinsic dimensionality of fluent texts in natural language is hovering around the value $9$ for several alphabet-based languages and around $7$ for Chinese, while the average intrinsic dimensionality of AI-generated texts for each language is $\\approx 1.5$ lower, with a clear statistical separation between human-generated and AI-generated distributions.

Concretely, Reflexion agents verbally reflect on task feedback signals, then maintain their own reflective text in an episodic memory buffer to induce better decision-making in subsequent trials. Reflexion is flexible enough to incorporate various types (scalar values or free-form language) and sources (external or internally simulated) of feedback signals, and obtains significant improvements over a baseline agent across diverse tasks (sequential decision-making, coding, language reasoning).

    "abstract": "Segmentation of curvilinear structures such as vasculature and road networks is challenging due to relatively weak signals and complex geometry/topology. To facilitate and accelerate large scale annotation, one has to adopt semi-automatic approaches such as proofreading by experts. In this work, we focus on uncertainty estimation for such tasks, so that highly uncertain, and thus error-prone structures can be identified for human annotators to verify. Unlike most existing works, which provide pixel-wise uncertainty maps, we stipulate it is crucial to estimate uncertainty in the units of topological structures, e.g., small pieces of connections and branches. To achieve this, we leverage tools from topological data analysis, specifically discrete Morse theory (DMT), to first capture the structures, and then reason about their uncertainties. To model the uncertainty, we (1) propose a joint prediction model that estimates the uncertainty of a structure while taking the neighboring structures into consideration (inter-structural uncertainty); (2) propose a novel Probabilistic DMT to model the inherent uncertainty within each structure (intra-structural uncertainty) by sampling its representations via a perturb-and-walk scheme.

    "abstract": "The ability for the brain to discriminate among visual stimuli is constrained by their retinal representations. Previous studies of visual discriminability have been limited to either low-dimensional artificial stimuli or pure theoretical considerations without a realistic encoding model. Here we propose a novel framework for understanding stimulus discriminability achieved by retinal representations of naturalistic stimuli with the method of information geometry. To model the joint probability distribution of neural responses conditioned on the stimulus, we created a stochastic encoding model of a population of salamander retinal ganglion cells based on a three-layer convolutional neural network model. This model not only accurately captured the mean response to natural scenes but also a variety of second-order statistics. With the model and the proposed theory, we computed the Fisher information metric over stimuli to study the most discriminable stimulus directions. We found that the most discriminable stimulus varied substantially across stimuli, allowing an examination of the relationship between the most discriminable stimulus and the current stimulus. By examining responses generated by the most discriminable stimuli we further found that the most discriminative response mode is often aligned with the most stochastic mode. This finding carries the important implication that under natural scenes, retinal noise correlations are information-limiting rather than increasing information transmission as has been previously speculated. We additionally observed that sensitivity saturates less in the population than for single cells and that as a function of firing rate, Fisher information varies less than sensitivity. We conclude that under natural scenes, population coding benefits from complementary coding and helps to equalize the information carried by different firing rates, which may facilitate decoding of the stimulus under principles of information maximization",

    "abstract": "Point clouds are versatile representations of 3D objects and have found widespread application in science and engineering. Many successful deep-learning models have been proposed that use them as input. The domain of chemical and materials modeling is especially challenging because exact compliance with physical constraints is highly desirable for a model to be usable in practice. These constraints include smoothness and invariance with respect to translations, rotations, and permutations of identical atoms. If these requirements are not rigorously fulfilled, atomistic simulations might lead to absurd outcomes even if the model has excellent accuracy. Consequently, dedicated architectures, which achieve invariance by restricting their design space, have been developed. General-purpose point-cloud models are more varied but often disregard rotational symmetry. We propose a general symmetrization method that adds rotational equivariance to any given model while preserving all the other requirements. Our approach simplifies the development of better atomic-scale ML schemes by relaxing the constraints on the design space and making it possible to incorporate ideas that proved effective in other domains. We demonstrate this idea by introducing the Point Edge Transformer (PET) architecture, which is not intrinsically equivariant but achieves state-of-the-art performance on several benchmark datasets of molecules and solids. A-posteriori application of our general protocol makes PET exactly equivariant, with minimal changes to its accuracy",

In our case, the SDE evolves inside a homogeneous latent space and is induced by stochastic dynamics of the corresponding (matrix) Lie group. In the context of learning problems, SDEs on the $n$-dimensional unit sphere are arguably the most relevant incarnation of this setup. For variational inference, the sphere not only facilitates using a uniform prior on the initial state of the SDE, but we also obtain a particularly simple and intuitive expression for the KL divergence between the approximate posterior and prior process in the evidence lower bound. We provide empirical evidence that a latent SDE of the proposed type can be learned efficiently by means of an existing one-step geometric Euler-Maruyama scheme.

    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "The promising zero-shot generalization of vision-language models such as CLIP has led to their adoption using prompt learning for numerous downstream tasks. Previous works have shown test-time prompt tuning using entropy minimization to adapt text prompts for unseen domains. While effective, this overlooks the key cause for performance degradation to unseen domains -- distribution shift. In this work, we explicitly handle this problem by aligning the out-of-distribution (OOD) test sample statistics to those of the source data using prompt tuning. We use a single test sample to adapt multi-modal prompts at test time by minimizing the feature distribution shift to bridge the gap in the test domain. Evaluating against the domain generalization benchmark, our method improves zero-shot top-1 accuracy beyond existing prompt-learning techniques, with a 3.08% improvement over the baseline MaPLe. In cross-dataset generalization with unseen categories across 10 datasets, our method improves consistently across all datasets compared to the existing state-of-the-art.

In particular, we consider several variants of SCP including the general case, the case where $f$ is additionally assumed to be monotone, and finally the case where $f$ is a regularized monotone submodular function. Our most significant contributions are that: (i) We propose a scalable algorithm for monotone SCP that achieves nearly the same approximation guarantees as the standard greedy algorithm in significantly faster time; (ii) We are the first to develop an algorithm for general SCP that achieves a solution arbitrarily close to being feasible; and finally (iii) we are the first to develop algorithms for regularized SCP.

    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "Bayesian brain theory suggests that the brain employs generative models to understand the external world. The sampling-based perspective posits that the brain infers the posterior distribution through samples of stochastic neuronal responses. Additionally, the brain continually updates its generative model to approach the true distribution of the external world. In this study, we introduce the Hierarchical Exponential-family Energy-based (HEE) model, which captures the dynamics of inference and learning. In the HEE model, we decompose the partition function into individual layers and leverage a group of neurons with shorter time constants to sample the gradient of the decomposed normalization term. This allows our model to estimate the partition function and perform inference simultaneously, circumventing the negative phase encountered in conventional energy-based models (EBMs). As a result, the learning process is localized both in time and space, and the model is easy to converge. To match the brain's rapid computation, we demonstrate that neural adaptation can serve as a momentum term, significantly accelerating the inference process. On natural image datasets, our model exhibits representations akin to those observed in the biological visual system. Furthermore, for the machine learning community, our model can generate observations through joint or marginal generation. We show that marginal generation outperforms joint generation and achieves performance on par with other EBMs",

    "abstract": "Supervised matrix factorization (SMF) is a classical machine learning method that simultaneously seeks feature extraction and classification tasks, which are not necessarily a priori aligned objectives. Our goal is to use SMF to learn low-rank latent factors that offer interpretable, data-reconstructive, and class-discriminative features, addressing challenges posed by high-dimensional data. Training SMF model involves solving a nonconvex and possibly constrained optimization with at least three blocks of parameters. Known algorithms are either heuristic or provide weak convergence guarantees for special cases. In this paper, we provide a novel framework that `lifts' SMF as a low-rank matrix estimation problem in a combined factor space and propose an efficient algorithm that provably converges exponentially fast to a global minimizer of the objective with arbitrary initialization under mild assumptions. Our framework applies to a wide range of SMF-type problems for multi-class classification with auxiliary features.

Our method aims to alleviate the potential negative effects of using the same normalization statistics for both token types, which may not be optimally aligned with their individual roles. We empirically show that by utilizing a separate normalization layer, the [CLS] embeddings can better encode the global contextual information and are distributed more uniformly in its anisotropic space.

    "abstract": "An important problem in time-series analysis is modeling systems with time-varying dynamics. Probabilistic models with joint continuous and discrete latent states offer interpretable, efficient, and experimentally useful descriptions of such data. Commonly used models include autoregressive hidden Markov models (ARHMMs) and switching linear dynamical systems (SLDSs), each with its own advantages and disadvantages. ARHMMs permit exact inference and easy parameter estimation, but are parameter intensive when modeling long dependencies, and hence are prone to overfitting. In contrast, SLDSs can capture long-range dependencies in a parameter efficient way through Markovian latent dynamics, but present an intractable likelihood and a challenging parameter estimation task. In this paper, we propose _switching autoregressive low-rank tensor_ SALT models, which retain the advantages of both approaches while ameliorating the weaknesses. SALT parameterizes the tensor of an ARHMM with a low-rank factorization to control the number of parameters and allow longer range dependencies without overfitting. We prove theoretical and discuss practical connections between SALT, linear dynamical systems, and SLDSs. We empirically demonstrate quantitative advantages of SALT models on a range of simulated and real prediction tasks, including behavioral and neural datasets. Furthermore, the learned low-rank tensor provides novel insights into temporal dependencies within each discrete state",

    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "Energy-based learning algorithms have recently gained a surge of interest due to their compatibility with analog (post-digital) hardware. Existing algorithms include contrastive learning (CL), equilibrium propagation (EP) and coupled learning (CpL), all consisting in contrasting two states, and differing in the type of perturbation used to obtain the second state from the first one. However, these algorithms have never been explicitly compared on equal footing with same models and datasets, making it difficult to assess their scalability and decide which one to select in practice. In this work, we carry out a comparison of seven learning algorithms, namely CL and different variants of EP and CpL depending on the signs of the perturbations. Specifically, using these learning algorithms, we train deep convolutional Hopfield networks (DCHNs) on five vision tasks (MNIST, F-MNIST, SVHN, CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100). We find that, while all algorithms yield comparable performance on MNIST, important differences in performance arise as the difficulty of the task increases. Our key findings reveal that negative perturbations are better than positive ones, and highlight the centered variant of EP (which uses two perturbations of opposite sign) as the best-performing algorithm. We also endorse these findings with theoretical arguments. Additionally, we establish new SOTA results with DCHNs on all five datasets, both in performance and speed. In particular, our DCHN simulations are 13.5 times faster with respect to Laborieux et al. (2021), which we achieve thanks to the use of a novel energy minimisation algorithm based on asynchronous updates, combined with reduced precision (16 bits)",

Geometric uncertainty due to~sampling or localized perturbations of data points is captured by Wasserstein DRO (WDRO), which seeks to learn a model that performs uniformly well over a Wasserstein ball centered around the observed data distribution. However, WDRO fails to account for non-geometric perturbations such as adversarial outliers, which can greatly distort the Wasserstein distance measurement and impede the learned model. We address this gap by proposing a novel outlier-robust WDRO framework for decision-making under both geometric (Wasserstein) perturbations and non-geometric (total variation (TV)) contamination that allows an $\\varepsilon$-fraction of data to be arbitrarily corrupted. We design an uncertainty set using a certain robust Wasserstein ball that accounts for both perturbation types and derive minimax optimal excess risk bounds for this procedure that explicitly capture the Wasserstein and TV risks. We prove a strong duality result that enables tractable convex reformulations and efficient computation of our outlier-robust WDRO problem. When the loss function depends only on low-dimensional features of the data, we eliminate certain dimension dependencies from the risk bounds that are unavoidable in the general setting. Finally, we present experiments validating our theory on standard regression and classification tasks",

This work has revealed a number of factors that systematically influence people's judgments, such as the violation of norms and whether the harm is avoidable or inevitable. We collected a dataset of stories from 24 cognitive science papers and developed a system to annotate each story with the factors they investigated. Using this dataset, we test whether large language models (LLMs) make causal and moral judgments about text-based scenarios that align with those of human participants. On the aggregate level, alignment has improved with more recent LLMs. However, using statistical analyses, we find that LLMs weigh the different factors quite differently from human participants. These results show how curated, challenge datasets combined with insights from cognitive science can help us go beyond comparisons based merely on aggregate metrics: we uncover LLMs implicit tendencies and show to what extent these align with human intuitions",

To address these challenges, this paper presents an innovative framework called the Graph of Circuits Explorer (GCX). Leveraging graph structure learning along with graph neural networks, GCX enables the creation of a surrogate model that facilitates efficient exploration of the optimal design space within a semi-supervised learning framework which reduces the need for large labelled datasets. The proposed approach comprises three key stages. First, we learn the geometric representation of circuits and enrich it with technology information to create a comprehensive feature vector. Subsequently, integrating feature-based graph learning with few-shot and zero-shot learning enhances the generalizability in predictions for unseen circuits. Finally, we introduce two algorithms namely, EASCO and ASTROG which upon integration with GCX optimize the available samples to yield the optimal circuit configuration meeting the designer's criteria. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated through simulated performance evaluation of various circuits, using derived parameters in 180nm CMOS technology. Furthermore, the generalizability of the approach is extended to higher-order topologies and different technology nodes such as 65nm and 45nm CMOS process nodes",

In this work, we propose a novel approach to address this challenge by learning intrinsic rewards from interactions with users. Specifically, we formulate intrinsic reward learning as a multi-objective bi-level optimization problem.

    "title": "Resilient Constrained Learning",

    "abstract": "When deploying machine learning solutions, they must satisfy multiple requirements beyond accuracy, such as fairness, robustness, or safety. These requirements are imposed during training either implicitly, using penalties, or explicitly, using constrained optimization methods based on Lagrangian duality. Either way, specifying requirements is hindered by the presence of compromises and limited prior knowledge about the data. Furthermore, their impact on performance can often only be evaluated by actually solving the learning problem. This paper presents a constrained learning approach that adapts the requirements while simultaneously solving the learning task. To do so, it relaxes the learning constraints in a way that contemplates how much they affect the task at hand by balancing the performance gains obtained from the relaxation against a user-defined cost of that relaxation. We call this approach resilient constrained learning after the term used to describe ecological systems that adapt to disruptions by modifying their operation. We show conditions under which this balance can be achieved and introduce a practical algorithm to compute it, for which we derive approximation and generalization guarantees.

In this problem, sample efficiency is crucial due to the time, money, and safety costs of real-world design evaluations. Existing approaches either rely on active data collection or access to large, labeled datasets of past experiments, making them impractical in many real-world scenarios. In this work, we address the more challenging yet realistic setting of few-shot experimental design, where only a few labeled data points of input designs and their corresponding values are available. We approach this problem as a conditional generation task, where a model conditions on a few labeled examples and the desired output to generate an optimal input design. To this end, we introduce Experiment Pretrained Transformers (ExPT), a foundation model for few-shot experimental design that employs a novel combination of synthetic pretraining with in-context learning. In ExPT, we only assume knowledge of a finite collection of unlabelled data points from the input domain and pretrain a transformer neural network to optimize diverse synthetic functions defined over this domain. Unsupervised pretraining allows ExPT to adapt to any design task at test time in an in-context fashion by conditioning on a few labeled data points from the target task and generating the candidate optima. We evaluate ExPT on few-shot experimental design in challenging domains and demonstrate its superior generality and performance compared to existing methods.

While well studied for prediction in classification tasks, the effectiveness of jittering for inverse problems has not been systematically investigated. In this paper, we present a novel analytical characterization of the optimal $\\ell_2$-worst-case robust estimator for linear denoising and show that jittering yields optimal robust denoisers. Furthermore, we examine jittering empirically via training deep neural networks (U-nets) for natural image denoising, deconvolution, and accelerated magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The results show that jittering significantly enhances the worst-case robustness, but can be suboptimal for inverse problems beyond denoising.

We showcase two example attacks: content injection and over-refusal attacks, each aiming to induce a specific exploitable behavior. We quantify and benchmark the strength and the stealthiness of our data poisoning scheme. Our results show that AutoPoison allows an adversary to change a model's behavior by poisoning only a small fraction of data while maintaining a high level of stealthiness in the poisoned examples.

We start by formally characterizing a sequence of discrete actions and continuous states using finite horizon Markov decision processes and a broad class of bijective structural causal models. Building upon this characterization, we formalize the problem of finding counterfactually optimal action sequences and show that, in general, we cannot expect to solve it in polynomial time. Then, we develop a search method based on the A* algorithm that, under a natural form of Lipschitz continuity of the environment's dynamics, is guaranteed to return the optimal solution to the problem. Experiments on real clinical data show that our method is very efficient in practice, and it has the potential to offer interesting insights for sequential decision making tasks",

    "abstract": "While performing favourably on the independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) instances, most of the existing neural methods for vehicle routing problems (VRPs) struggle to generalize in the presence of a distribution shift. To tackle this issue, we propose an ensemble-based deep reinforcement learning method for VRPs, which learns a group of diverse sub-policies to cope with various instance distributions. In particular, to prevent convergence of the parameters to the same one, we enforce diversity across sub-policies by leveraging Bootstrap with random initialization. Moreover, we also explicitly pursue inequality between sub-policies by exploiting regularization terms during training to further enhance diversity. Experimental results show that our method is able to outperform the state-of-the-art neural baselines on randomly generated instances of various distributions, and also generalizes favourably on the benchmark instances from TSPLib and CVRPLib, which confirmed the effectiveness of the whole method and the respective designs",

    "abstract": "Achieving a balance between image quality (precision) and diversity (recall) is a significant challenge in the domain of generative models. Current state-of-the-art models primarily rely on optimizing heuristics, such as the Fr\\'echet Inception Distance. While recent developments have introduced principled methods for evaluating precision and recall, they have yet to be successfully integrated into the training of generative models. Our main contribution is a novel training method for generative models, such as Generative Adversarial Networks and Normalizing Flows, which explicitly optimizes a user-defined trade-off between precision and recall. More precisely, we show that achieving a specified precision-recall trade-off corresponds to minimizing a unique $f$-divergence from a family we call the \\mbox{\\em PR-divergences}. Conversely, any $f$-divergence can be written as a linear combination of PR-divergences and corresponds to a weighted precision-recall trade-off.

A crucial part of predictive uncertainty quantification is the estimation of epistemic uncertainty, which is defined as an integral of the product between a divergence function and the posterior.

We suggest Quantification of Uncertainty with Adversarial Models (QUAM) to better estimate the epistemic uncertainty. QUAM identifies regions where the whole product under the integral is large, not just the posterior. Consequently, QUAM has lower approximation error of the epistemic uncertainty compared to previous methods. Models for which the product is large correspond to adversarial models (not adversarial examples!). Adversarial models have both a high posterior as well as a high divergence between their predictions and that of a reference model.

    "abstract": "Vision transformers (ViTs) are top-performing models on many computer vision benchmarks and can accurately predict human behavior on object recognition tasks. However, researchers question the value of using ViTs as models of biological learning because ViTs are thought to be more \"data hungry\" than brains, with ViTs requiring more training data than brains to reach similar levels of performance. To test this assumption, we directly compared the learning abilities of ViTs and animals, by performing parallel controlled-rearing experiments on ViTs and newborn chicks. We first raised chicks in impoverished visual environments containing a single object, then simulated the training data available in those environments by building virtual animal chambers in a video game engine. We recorded the first-person images acquired by agents moving through the virtual chambers and used those images to train self-supervised ViTs that leverage time as a teaching signal, akin to biological visual systems. When ViTs were trained \"through the eyes\" of newborn chicks, the ViTs solved the same view-invariant object recognition tasks as the chicks. Thus, ViTs were not more data hungry than newborn chicks: both learned view-invariant object representations in impoverished visual environments. The flexible and generic attention-based learning mechanism in ViTs—combined with the embodied data streams available to newborn animals—appears sufficient to drive the development of animal-like object recognition",

Current standard methods primarily rely on synchronous centralized algorithms which induce major communication bottlenecks and synchronization locks at scale. Decentralized asynchronous algorithms are emerging as a potential alternative but their practical applicability still lags. In order to mitigate the increase in communication cost that naturally comes with scaling the number of workers, we introduce a principled asynchronous, randomized, gossip-based optimization algorithm which works thanks to a continuous local momentum named $\\textbf{A}^2\\textbf{CiD}^2$. Our method allows each worker to continuously process mini-batches without stopping, and run a peer-to-peer averaging routine in parallel, reducing idle time. In addition to inducing a significant communication acceleration at no cost other than adding a local momentum variable, minimal adaptation is required to incorporate $\\textbf{A}^2\\textbf{CiD}^2$ to standard asynchronous approaches. Our theoretical analysis proves accelerated rates compared to previous asynchronous decentralized baselines and we empirically show that using our $\\textbf{A}^2\\textbf{CiD}^2$ momentum significantly decrease communication costs in poorly connected networks.

    "abstract": "Recent research indicates that the performance of machine learning models can be improved by aligning the geometry of the latent space with the underlying data structure. Rather than relying solely on Euclidean space, researchers have proposed using hyperbolic and spherical spaces with constant curvature, or combinations thereof, to better model the latent space and enhance model performance. However, little attention has been given to the problem of automatically identifying the optimal latent geometry for the downstream task. We mathematically define this novel formulation and coin it as neural latent geometry search (NLGS). More specifically, we introduce an initial attempt to search for a latent geometry composed of a product of constant curvature model spaces with a small number of query evaluations, under some simplifying assumptions. To accomplish this, we propose a novel notion of distance between candidate latent geometries based on the Gromov-Hausdorff distance from metric geometry. In order to compute the Gromov-Hausdorff distance, we introduce a mapping function that enables the comparison of different manifolds by embedding them in a common high-dimensional ambient space. We then design a graph search space based on the notion of smoothness between latent geometries and employ the calculated distances as an additional inductive bias. Finally, we use Bayesian optimization to search for the optimal latent geometry in a query-efficient manner. This is a general method which can be applied to search for the optimal latent geometry for a variety of models and downstream tasks. We perform experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets to identify the optimal latent geometry for multiple machine learning problems",

Rand-$k$ sparsification is a commonly used technique to reduce communication cost, where each client sends $k < d$ of its coordinates to the server. However, Rand-$k$ is agnostic to any correlations, that might exist between clients in practical scenarios. The recently proposed Rand-$k$-Spatial estimator leverages the cross-client correlation information at the server to improve Rand-$k$'s performance. Yet, the performance of Rand-$k$-Spatial is suboptimal, and improving mean estimation is key to a faster convergence in distributed optimization. We propose the Rand-Proj-Spatial estimator with a more flexible encoding-decoding procedure, which generalizes the encoding of Rand-$k$ by projecting the client vectors to a random $k$-dimensional subspace. We utilize Subsampled Randomized Hadamard Transform (SRHT) as the projection matrix, and show that Rand-Proj-Spatial with SRHT outperforms Rand-$k$-Spatial, using the correlation information more efficiently. Furthermore, we propose an approach to incorporate varying degrees of correlation, and suggest a practical variant of Rand-Proj-Spatial when the correlation information is not available to the server. Finally, experiments on real-world distributed optimization tasks showcase the superior performance of Rand-Proj-Spatial compared to Rand-$k$-Spatial and other more sophisticated sparsification techniques",

We study three broadly applicable problem classes in FL: (i) Nondifferentiable nonconvex optimization; (ii) Federated bilevel optimization; (iii) Federated minimax problems. Notably, in an implicit sense, both (ii) and (iii) are instances of (i). However, these hierarchical problems are often complicated by the absence of a closed-form expression for the implicit objective function. Unfortunately, research on these problems has been limited and afflicted by reliance on strong assumptions, including the need for differentiability and L-smoothness of the implicit function. We address this shortcoming by making the following contributions. In (i), by leveraging convolution-based smoothing and Clarke's subdifferential calculus, we devise a randomized smoothing-enabled zeroth-order FL method and derive communication and iteration complexity guarantees for computing an approximate Clarke stationary point. To contend with (ii) and (iii), we devise a unifying randomized implicit zeroth-order FL framework, equipped with explicit communication and iteration complexities. Importantly, our method utilizes delays during local steps to skip calling the inexact lower-level FL oracle. This results in significant reduction in communication overhead when addressing hierarchical problems. We empirically validate the theory on nonsmooth and hierarchical ML problems",

    "abstract": "Deep learning practice is increasingly driven by powerful foundation models (FM), pre-trained at scale and then fine-tuned for specific tasks of interest. A key property of this workflow is the efficacy of performing sparse or parameter-efficient fine-tuning, meaning that by updating only a tiny fraction of the whole FM parameters on a downstream task can lead to surprisingly good performance, often even superior to a full model update. However, it is not clear what is the optimal and principled way to select which parameters to update. Although a growing number of sparse fine-tuning ideas have been proposed, they are mostly not satisfactory, relying on hand-crafted heuristics or heavy approximation. In this paper we propose a novel Bayesian sparse fine-tuning algorithm: we place a (sparse) Laplace prior for each parameter of the FM, with the mean equal to the initial value and the scale parameter having a hyper-prior that encourages small scale. Roughly speaking, the posterior means of the scale parameters indicate how important it is to update the corresponding parameter away from its initial value when solving the downstream task. Given the sparse prior, most scale parameters are small a posteriori, and the few large-valued scale parameters identify those FM parameters that crucially need to be updated away from their initial values. Based on this, we can threshold the scale parameters to decide which parameters to update or freeze, leading to a principled sparse fine-tuning strategy. To efficiently infer the posterior distribution of the scale parameters, we adopt the Langevin MCMC sampler, requiring only two times the complexity of the vanilla SGD. Tested on popular NLP benchmarks as well as the VTAB vision tasks, our approach shows significant improvement over the state-of-the-arts (e.g., 1% point higher than the best SOTA when fine-tuning RoBERTa for GLUE and SuperGLUE benchmarks)",

However, it is often argued that correct predictions in the tail are more \"interesting\" or \"rewarding,\" but the community has not yet settled on a metric capturing this intuitive concept.

    "abstract": "In federated frequency estimation (FFE), multiple clients work together to estimate the frequency of their local data by communicating with a server, while maintaining the security constraint of $\\mathtt{secsum}$ where the server can only access the sum of client-held vectors. For FFE with a single communication round, it is known that count sketch is nearly information-theoretically optimal [Chen et al., 2022]. However, when multiple communication rounds are allowed, we propose a new sketch algorithm that is provably more accurate than a naive adaptation of count sketch. Furthermore, we show that both our sketch algorithm and count sketch can achieve better accuracy when the problem instance is simpler. Therefore, we propose a two-phase approach to enable the use of a smaller sketch size for simpler problems. Finally, we provide mechanisms to make our proposed algorithm differentially private. We verify the performance of our methods through experiments conducted on real datasets",

This gives rise to a high-dimensional, low-rank matrix estimation problem to which standard matrix estimators cannot be applied.

This is a challenging problem because of the 2D-3D ambiguity and the open-vocabulary nature of the target tasks, where obtaining annotated training data in 3D is difficult. The contributions of this work are three-fold. First, we design a new model architecture for open-vocabulary 3D semantic occupancy prediction. The architecture consists of a 2D-3D encoder together with occupancy prediction and 3D-language heads. The output is a dense voxel map of 3D grounded language embeddings enabling a range of open-vocabulary tasks. Second, we develop a tri-modal self-supervised learning algorithm that leverages three modalities: (i) images, (ii) language and (iii) LiDAR point clouds, and enables training the proposed architecture using a strong pre-trained vision-language model without the need for any 3D manual language annotations. Finally, we demonstrate quantitatively the strengths of the proposed model on several open-vocabulary tasks: Zero-shot 3D semantic segmentation using existing datasets; 3D grounding and retrieval of free-form language queries, using a small dataset that we propose as an extension of nuScenes",

    "title": "Generative Modelling of Stochastic Actions with Arbitrary Constraints in Reinforcement Learning",
    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "Many problems in Reinforcement Learning (RL) seek an optimal policy with large discrete multidimensional yet unordered action spaces; these include problems in randomized allocation of resources such as placements of multiple security resources and emergency response units, etc. A challenge in this setting is that the underlying action space is categorical (discrete and unordered) and large, for which existing RL methods do not perform well. Moreover, these problems require validity of the realized action (allocation); this validity constraint is often difficult to express compactly in a closed mathematical form. The allocation nature of the problem also prefers stochastic optimal policies, if one exists. In this work, we address these challenges by (1) applying a (state) conditional normalizing flow to compactly represent the stochastic policy — the compactness arises due to the network only producing one sampled action and the corresponding log probability of the action, which is then used by an actor-critic method; and (2) employing an invalid action rejection method (via a valid action oracle) to update the base policy. The action rejection is enabled by a modified policy gradient that we derive. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments to show the scalability of our approach compared to prior methods and the ability to enforce arbitrary state-conditional constraints on the support of the distribution of actions in any state",

    "abstract": "Algorithmic stability is an important notion that has proven powerful for deriving generalization bounds for practical algorithms. The last decade has witnessed an increasing number of stability bounds for different algorithms applied on different classes of loss functions. While these bounds have illuminated various properties of optimization algorithms, the analysis of each case typically required a different proof technique with significantly different mathematical tools. In this study, we make a novel connection between learning theory and applied probability and introduce a unified guideline for proving Wasserstein stability bounds for stochastic optimization algorithms. We illustrate our approach on stochastic gradient descent (SGD) and we obtain time-uniform stability bounds (i.e., the bound does not increase with the number of iterations) for strongly convex losses and non-convex losses with additive noise, where we recover similar results to the prior art or extend them to more general cases by using a single proof technique. Our approach is flexible and can be generalizable to other popular optimizers, as it mainly requires developing Lyapunov functions, which are often readily available in the literature. It also illustrates that ergodicity is an important component for obtaining time-uniform bounds -- which might not be achieved for convex or non-convex losses unless additional noise is injected to the iterates. Finally, we slightly stretch our analysis technique and prove time-uniform bounds for SGD under convex and non-convex losses (without additional additive noise), which, to our knowledge, is novel",

More explicit forms of flatness regularization also empirically improve the generalization performance. However, it remains unclear why and when flatness regularization leads to better generalization. This work takes the first step towards understanding the inductive bias of the minimum trace of the Hessian solutions in an important setting: learning deep linear networks from linear measurements, also known as \\emph{deep matrix factorization}. We show that with the standard Restricted Isometry Property (RIP) on the measurements, minimizing the trace of Hessian is approximately equivalent to minimizing the Schatten 1-norm of the corresponding end-to-end matrix parameters (i.e., the product of all layer matrices), which in turn leads to better generalization",

In this paper, we introduce a novel technique called Tree-Ring Watermarking that robustly fingerprints diffusion model outputs. Unlike existing methods that perform post-hoc modifications to images after sampling, Tree-Ring Watermarking subtly influences the entire sampling process, resulting in a model fingerprint that is invisible to humans. The watermark embeds a pattern into the initial noise vector used for sampling. These patterns are structured in Fourier space so that they are invariant to convolutions, crops, dilations, flips, and rotations. After image generation, the watermark signal is detected by inverting the diffusion process to retrieve the noise vector, which is then checked for the embedded signal. We demonstrate that this technique can be easily applied to arbitrary diffusion models, including text-conditioned Stable Diffusion, as a plug-in with negligible loss in FID. Our watermark is semantically hidden in the image space and is far more robust than watermarking alternatives that are currently deployed",

Such graphs are typically known to be locally tree-like. We introduce a notion of Bayes optimality for node classification tasks, called asymptotic local Bayes optimality, and compute the optimal classifier according to this criterion for a fairly general statistical data model with arbitrary distributions of the node features and edge connectivity. The optimal classifier is implementable using a message-passing graph neural network architecture. We then compute the generalization error of this classifier and compare its performance against existing learning methods theoretically on a well-studied statistical model with naturally identifiable signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) in the data. We find that the optimal message-passing architecture interpolates between a standard MLP in the regime of low graph signal and a typical convolution in the regime of high graph signal.

IMP integrates multimodal inputs including image, video, text, and audio into a single Transformer encoder with minimal modality-specific components. IMP makes use of a novel design that combines Alternating Gradient Descent (AGD) and Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) for efficient model & task scaling. We conduct extensive empirical studies and reveal the following key insights: 1) performing gradient descent updates by alternating on diverse modalities, loss functions, and tasks, with varying input resolutions, efficiently improves the model. 2) sparsification with MoE on a single modality-agnostic encoder substantially improves the performance, outperforming dense models that use modality-specific encoders or additional fusion layers and greatly mitigating the conflicts between modalities. IMP achieves competitive performance on a wide range of downstream tasks including video classification, image classification, image-text, and video-text retrieval. Most notably, we train a sparse IMP-MoE-L focusing on video tasks that achieves new state-of-the-art in zero-shot video classification: 77.0% on Kinetics-400, 76.8% on Kinetics-600, and 68.3% on Kinetics-700, improving the previous state-of-the-art by +5%, +6.7%, and +5.8%, respectively, while using only 15% of their total training computational cost",

    "abstract": "Imitation learning uses data for training policies to solve complex tasks. However, when the training data is collected from human demonstrators, it often leads to multimodal distributions because of the variability in human actions. Most imitation learning methods rely on a maximum likelihood (ML) objective to learn a parameterized policy, but this can result in suboptimal or unsafe behavior due to the mode-averaging property of the ML objective. In this work, we propose Information Maximizing Curriculum, a curriculum-based approach that assigns a weight to each data point and encourages the model to specialize in the data it can represent, effectively mitigating the mode-averaging problem by allowing the model to ignore data from modes it cannot represent. To cover all modes and thus, enable versatile behavior, we extend our approach to a mixture of experts (MoE) policy, where each mixture component selects its own subset of the training data for learning. A novel, maximum entropy-based objective is proposed to achieve full coverage of the dataset, thereby enabling the policy to encompass all modes within the data distribution.

In this work, we study how prior data without reward labels may be used to guide and accelerate exploration for an agent solving a new sparse reward task. We propose a simple approach that learns a reward model from online experience, labels the unlabeled prior data with optimistic rewards, and then uses it concurrently alongside the online data for downstream policy and critic optimization. This general formula leads to rapid exploration in several challenging sparse-reward domains where tabula rasa exploration is insufficient, including the AntMaze domain, Adroit hand manipulation domain, and a visual simulated robotic manipulation domain.

Discovering these equations directly from data is challenging because it requires modeling relationships between various derivatives that are not observed in the data (equation-data mismatch) and it involves searching across a huge space of possible equations. Current approaches make strong assumptions about the form of the equation and thus fail to discover many well-known phenomena. Moreover, many of them resolve the equation-data mismatch by estimating the derivatives, which makes them inadequate for noisy and infrequent observations. To this end, we propose D-CIPHER, which is robust to measurement artifacts and can uncover a new and very general class of differential equations. We further design a novel optimization procedure, CoLLie, to help D-CIPHER search through this class efficiently.

Nonetheless, retaining data in individual clients introduces fundamental challenges to achieving performance on par with centrally trained models.

It underscores the critical role of thoughtful architectural design choices in achieving optimal performance, a factor often neglected in the FL literature. Many existing FL solutions are tested on shallow or simple networks, which may not accurately reflect real-world applications. This practice restricts the transferability of research findings to large-scale visual recognition models. Through an in-depth analysis of diverse cutting-edge architectures such as convolutional neural networks, transformers, and MLP-mixers, we experimentally demonstrate that architectural choices can substantially enhance FL systems' performance, particularly when handling heterogeneous data. We study visual recognition models from five different architectural families on four challenging FL datasets. We also re-investigate the inferior performance convolution-based architectures in the FL setting and analyze the influence of normalization layers on the FL performance.

Recent studies show that even advanced attacks cannot break such defenses effectively, since the purification process induces an extremely deep computational graph which poses the potential problem of gradient obfuscation, high memory cost, and unbounded randomness. In this paper, we propose a unified framework DiffAttack to perform effective and efficient attacks against diffusion-based purification defenses, including both DDPM and score-based approaches. In particular, we propose a deviated-reconstruction loss at intermediate diffusion steps to induce inaccurate density gradient estimation to tackle the problem of vanishing/exploding gradients. We also provide a segment-wise forwarding-backwarding algorithm, which leads to memory-efficient gradient backpropagation. We validate the attack effectiveness of DiffAttack compared with existing adaptive attacks on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet.

    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) has enabled novel view synthesis with high fidelity given images and camera poses. Subsequent works even succeeded in eliminating the necessity of pose priors by jointly optimizing NeRF and camera pose. However, these works are limited to relatively simple settings such as photometrically consistent and occluder-free image collections or a sequence of images from a video. So they have difficulty handling unconstrained images with varying illumination and transient occluders. In this paper, we propose **UP-NeRF** (**U**nconstrained **P**ose-prior-free **Ne**ural **R**adiance **F**ields) to optimize NeRF with unconstrained image collections without camera pose prior. We tackle these challenges with surrogate tasks that optimize color-insensitive feature fields and a separate module for transient occluders to block their influence on pose estimation. In addition, we introduce a candidate head to enable more robust pose estimation and transient-aware depth supervision to minimize the effect of incorrect prior. Our experiments verify the superior performance of our method compared to the baselines including BARF and its variants in a challenging internet photo collection, *Phototourism dataset*.

    "title": "Stable Vectorization of Multiparameter Persistent Homology using Signed Barcodes as Measures",
    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "Persistent homology (PH) provides topological descriptors for geometric data, such as weighted graphs, which are interpretable, stable to perturbations, and invariant under, e.g., relabeling. Most applications of PH focus on the one-parameter case---where the descriptors summarize the changes in topology of data as it is filtered by a single quantity of interest---and there is now a wide array of methods enabling the use of one-parameter PH descriptors in data science, which rely on the stable vectorization of these descriptors as elements of a Hilbert space. Although the multiparameter PH (MPH) of data that is filtered by several quantities of interest encodes much richer information than its one-parameter counterpart, the scarceness of stability results for MPH descriptors has so far limited the available options for the stable vectorization of MPH. In this paper, we aim to bring together the best of both worlds by showing how the interpretation of signed barcodes---a recent family of MPH descriptors---as signed Radon measures leads to natural extensions of vectorization strategies from one parameter to multiple parameters. The resulting feature vectors are easy to define and to compute, and provably stable. While, as a proof of concept, we focus on simple choices of signed barcodes and vectorizations, we already see notable performance improvements when comparing our feature vectors to state-of-the-art topology-based methods on various types of data",

To investigate this hypothesis, we develop RBlur, an image transform that simulates the loss in fidelity of peripheral vision by blurring the image and reducing its color saturation based on the distance from a given fixation point. We show that compared to DNNs trained on the original images, DNNs trained on images transformed by RBlur are substantially more robust to adversarial attacks, as well as other, non-adversarial, corruptions, achieving up to 25% higher accuracy on perturbed data",

On a new dataset of bulk catalysts with charge densities, we show density models can generalize to new structures with combinations of elements not seen at train time, a form of combinatorial generalization. We show that over 80% of binary and ternary test cases achieve faster convergence than standard baselines in Density Functional Theory, amounting to an average reduction of 13% in the number of iterations required to reach convergence, which may be of independent interest.

This problem arises in many contexts, e.g., a hospital and an airline may want to jointly determine whether people who take long-haul flights are more likely to catch respiratory infections. If they join their data by a common keyed user identifier such as email address, they can determine the answer, though it breaks privacy. This paper shows how the hospital can generate a private sketch and how the airline can privately join with the hospital's sketch by email address. The proposed solution satisfies pure differential privacy and gives approximate answers to linear queries and optimization problems over those joins. Whereas prior work such as secure function evaluation requires sender/receiver interaction, a distinguishing characteristic of the proposed approach is that it is non-interactive. Consequently, the sketch can be published to a repository for any organization to join with, facilitating data discovery.

    "abstract": "Bridging logical reasoning and deep learning is crucial for advanced AI systems. In this work, we present a new framework that addresses this goal by generating interpretable and verifiable logical rules through differentiable learning, without relying on pre-specified logical structures. Our approach builds upon SATNet, a differentiable MaxSAT solver that learns the underlying rules from input-output examples. Despite its efficacy, the learned weights in SATNet are not straightforwardly interpretable, failing to produce human-readable rules. To address this, we propose a novel specification method called ``maximum equality'', which enables the interchangeability between the learned weights of SATNet and a set of propositional logical rules in weighted MaxSAT form. With the decoded weighted MaxSAT formula, we further introduce several effective verification techniques to validate it against the ground truth rules. Experiments on stream transformations and Sudoku problems show that our decoded rules are highly reliable: using exact solvers on them could achieve 100% accuracy, whereas the original SATNet fails to give correct solutions in many cases. Furthermore, we formally verify that our decoded logical rules are functionally equivalent to the ground truth ones",

    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "No-regret learners seek to minimize the difference between the loss they cumulated through the actions they played, and the loss they would have cumulated in hindsight had they consistently modified their behavior according to some strategy transformation function. The size of the set of transformations considered by the learner determines a natural notion of rationality. As the set of transformations each learner considers grows, the strategies played by the learners recover more complex game-theoretic equilibria, including correlated equilibria in normal-form games and extensive-form correlated equilibria in extensive-form games. At the extreme, a no-swap-regret agent is one that minimizes regret against the set of all functions from the set of strategies to itself. While it is known that the no-swap-regret condition can be attained efficiently in nonsequential (normal-form) games, understanding what is the strongest notion of rationality that can be attained efficiently in the worst case in sequential (extensive-form) games is a longstanding open problem. In this paper we provide a positive result, by showing that it is possible, in any sequential game, to retain polynomial-time (in the game tree size) iterations while achieving sublinear regret with respect to all linear transformations of the mixed strategy space, a notion called no-linear-swap regret. This notion of hindsight rationality is as strong as no-swap-regret in nonsequential games, and stronger than no-trigger-regret in sequential games—thereby proving the existence of a subset of extensive-form correlated equilibria robust to linear deviations, which we call linear-deviation correlated equilibria, that can be approached efficiently",

Existing PbRL methods generally involve a two-step procedure: they first learn a reward model based on given preference data and then employ off-the-shelf reinforcement learning algorithms using the learned reward model. However, obtaining an accurate reward model solely from preference information, especially when the preference is from human teachers, can be difficult. Instead, we propose a PbRL algorithm that directly learns from preference without requiring any reward modeling. To achieve this, we adopt a contrastive learning framework to design a novel policy scoring metric that assigns a high score to policies that align with the given preferences. We apply our algorithm to offline RL tasks with actual human preference labels and show that our algorithm outperforms or is on par with the existing PbRL methods. Notably, on high-dimensional control tasks, our algorithm surpasses offline RL methods that learn with ground-truth reward information. Finally, we show that our algorithm can be successfully applied to fine-tune large language models",

We consider this problem in the fully dynamic model, i.e., under insertions and deletions of points, for the case that the metric space has a bounded doubling dimension $dim$. We utilize a hierarchical data structure to maintain the points and their neighborhoods, which enables us to efficiently find the clusters. In particular, our data structure can be queried at any time to generate a $(3+\\varepsilon)$-approximate solution for input values of $k$ and $z$ in worst-case query time $\\varepsilon^{-O(dim)}k \\log{n} \\log\\log{\\Delta}$, where $\\Delta$ is the ratio between the maximum and minimum distance between two points in $P$.

To tackle this challenge, Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) has emerged as a promising training method, which can improve the generalization of neural networks even in the presence of label noise. However, a deep understanding of how SAM works, especially in the setting of nonlinear neural networks and classification tasks, remains largely missing. This paper fills this gap by demonstrating why SAM generalizes better than Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) for a certain data model and two-layer convolutional ReLU networks. The loss landscape of our studied problem is nonsmooth, thus current explanations for the success of SAM based on the Hessian information are insufficient.

    "abstract": "Attention mechanisms play a crucial role in cognitive systems by allowing them to flexibly allocate cognitive resources. Transformers, in particular, have become a dominant architecture in machine learning, with attention as their central innovation. However, the underlying intuition and formalism of attention in Transformers is based on ideas of keys and queries in database management systems. In this work, we pursue a structural inference perspective, building upon, and bringing together, previous theoretical descriptions of attention such as; Gaussian Mixture Models, alignment mechanisms and Hopfield Networks. Specifically, we demonstrate that attention can be viewed as inference over an implicitly defined set of possible adjacency structures in a graphical model, revealing the generality of such a mechanism. This perspective unifies different attentional architectures in machine learning and suggests potential modifications and generalizations of attention. Here we investigate two and demonstrate their behaviour on explanatory toy problems: (a) extending the value function to incorporate more nodes of a graphical model yielding a mechanism with a bias toward attending multiple tokens; (b) introducing a geometric prior (with conjugate hyper-prior) over the adjacency structures producing a mechanism which dynamically scales the context window depending on input. Moreover, by describing a link between structural inference and precision-regulation in Predictive Coding Networks, we discuss how this framework can bridge the gap between attentional mechanisms in machine learning and Bayesian conceptions of attention in Neuroscience. We hope by providing a new lens on attention architectures our work can guide the development of new and improved attentional mechanisms",

In particular, we show that it is possible to exploit invariances across environments, wherever they may occur in the underlying causal model, to consistently improve learning.

    "title": "Should Under-parameterized Student Networks Copy or Average Teacher Weights?",
    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "Any continuous function $f^*$ can be approximated arbitrarily well by a neural network with sufficiently many neurons $k$. We consider the case when $f^*$ itself is a neural network with one hidden layer and $k$ neurons. Approximating $f^*$ with a neural network with $n< k$ neurons can thus be seen as fitting an under-parameterized \"student\" network with $n$ neurons to a \"teacher\" network with $k$ neurons. As the student has fewer neurons than the teacher, it is unclear, whether each of the $n$ student neurons should copy one of the teacher neurons or rather average a group of teacher neurons. For shallow neural networks with erf activation function and for the standard Gaussian input distribution, we prove that \"copy-average\" configurations are critical points if the teacher's incoming vectors are orthonormal and its outgoing weights are unitary. Moreover, the optimum among such configurations is reached when $n-1$ student neurons each copy one teacher neuron and the $n$-th student neuron averages the remaining $k-n+1$ teacher neurons. For the student network with $n=1$ neuron, we provide additionally a closed-form solution of the non-trivial critical point(s) for commonly used activation functions through solving an equivalent constrained optimization problem. Empirically, we find for the erf activation function that gradient flow converges either to the optimal copy-average critical point or to another point where each student neuron approximately copies a different teacher neuron.

    "abstract": "Reinforcement learning has shown promising results in learning neural network policies for complicated control tasks. However, the lack of formal guarantees about the behavior of such policies remains an impediment to their deployment. We propose a novel method for learning a composition of neural network policies in stochastic environments, along with a formal certificate which guarantees that a specification over the policy's behavior is satisfied with the desired probability. Unlike prior work on verifiable RL, our approach leverages the compositional nature of logical specifications provided in SpectRL, to learn over graphs of probabilistic reach-avoid specifications. The formal guarantees are provided by learning neural network policies together with reach-avoid supermartingales (RASM) for the graph's sub-tasks and then composing them into a global policy. We also derive a tighter lower bound compared to previous work on the probability of reach-avoidance implied by a RASM, which is required to find a compositional policy with an acceptable probabilistic threshold for complex tasks with multiple edge policies. We implement a prototype of our approach and evaluate it on a Stochastic Nine Rooms environment",

However, when adapting these priors to complex visual modalities, often represented as multiple images (e.g., video or 3D scene), achieving consistency across a set of images is challenging. In this paper, we address this challenge with a novel method, Collaborative Score Distillation (CSD). CSD is based on the Stein Variational Gradient Descent (SVGD). Specifically, we propose to consider multiple samples as \"particles\" in the SVGD update and combine their score functions to distill generative priors over a set of images synchronously. Thus, CSD facilitates the seamless integration of information across 2D images, leading to a consistent visual synthesis across multiple samples. We show the effectiveness of CSD in a variety of editing tasks, encompassing the visual editing of panorama images, videos, and 3D scenes.

Given two sets $A$ and $B$ of $n$ points in a $2$-dimensional Euclidean space, one can use a fast implementation of the Hungarian method to compute a minimum-cost bipartite matching of $A$ and $B$ in $\\tilde{O}(n^2)$ time. Let $\\Delta$ be the spread, i.e., the ratio of the distance of the farthest to the closest pair of points in $A\\cup B$. In this paper, we present a new algorithm to compute a minimum-cost bipartite matching of $A$ and $B$ with a similar worst-case execution time of $\\tilde{O}(n^2 \\log \\Delta)$. However, when $A$ and $B$ are drawn independently and identically from a fixed distribution that is not known to the algorithm, the execution time of our algorithm is, in expectation, $\\tilde{O}(n^{7/4}\\log \\Delta)$. To the best of our knowledge, our algorithm is the first one to achieve a sub-quadratic execution time even for stochastic point sets with real-valued coordinates. Our algorithm extends to any dimension $d$, where it runs in $\\tilde{O}(n^{2-\\frac{1}{2d}}\\Phi(n))$ time for stochastic point sets $A$ and $B$; here $\\Phi(n)$ is the query/update time of a dynamic weighted nearest neighbor data structure.

These approaches, however, might not be effective at increasing the margin in the input (feature) space. In this paper, we propose a differentiable regularizer that is a lower bound on the distance of the data points to the classification boundary. The proposed regularizer requires knowledge of the model's Lipschitz constant along certain directions. To this end, we develop a scalable method for calculating guaranteed differentiable upper bounds on the Lipschitz constant of neural networks accurately and efficiently. The relative accuracy of the bounds prevents excessive regularization and allows for more direct manipulation of the decision boundary. Furthermore, our Lipschitz bounding algorithm exploits the monotonicity and Lipschitz continuity of the activation layers, and the resulting bounds can be used to design new layers with controllable bounds on their Lipschitz constant.

Specifically, the edges in a causal graph exist with uncertainties which may, for example, represent degree of belief from domain experts. Alternatively, the uncertainty about an edge may reflect the confidence of a particular statistical test. The question that naturally arises in this setting is: Given such a probabilistic graph and a specific causal effect of interest, what is the subgraph which has the highest plausibility and for which the causal effect is identifiable?

Most prior works focus on capturing the inter-domain transferability but largely overlook rich intra-domain structures, which empirically results in even worse discriminability. In this work, we introduce a novel graph SPectral Alignment (SPA) framework to tackle the tradeoff. The core of our method is briefly condensed as follows: (i)-by casting the DA problem to graph primitives, SPA composes a coarse graph alignment mechanism with a novel spectral regularizer towards aligning the domain graphs in eigenspaces; (ii)-we further develop a fine-grained message propagation module --- upon a novel neighbor-aware self-training mechanism --- in order for enhanced discriminability in the target domain. On standardized benchmarks, the extensive experiments of SPA demonstrate that its performance has surpassed the existing cutting-edge DA methods. Coupled with dense model analysis, we conclude that our approach indeed possesses superior efficacy, robustness, discriminability, and transferability.

    "abstract": "Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a powerful scheme to facilitate the collaborative learning of models amongst a set of agents holding their own private data. Although the agents benefit from the global model trained on shared data, by participating in federated learning, they may also incur costs (related to privacy and communication) due to data sharing. In this paper, we model a collaborative FL framework, where every agent attempts to achieve an optimal trade-off between her learning payoff and data sharing cost. We show the existence of Nash equilibrium (NE) under mild assumptions on agents' payoff and costs. Furthermore, we show that agents can discover the NE via best response dynamics. However, some of the NE may be bad in terms of overall welfare for the agents, implying little incentive for some fraction of the agents to participate in the learning. To remedy this, we design a budget-balanced mechanism involving payments to the agents, that ensures that any $p$-mean welfare function of the agents' utilities is maximized at NE. In addition, we introduce a FL protocol FedBR-BG that incorporates our budget-balanced mechanism, utilizing best response dynamics. Our empirical validation on MNIST and CIFAR-10 substantiates our theoretical analysis. We show that FedBR-BG outperforms the basic best-response-based protocol without additional incentivization, the standard federated learning protocol FedAvg, as well as a recent baseline MWFed in terms of achieving superior $p$-mean welfare",

Although the degree of data augmentations has been well controlled by utilizing pre-defined techniques in some domains like vision, time-series data augmentation is less explored and remains a challenging problem due to the complexity of the data generation mechanism, such as the intricate mechanism involved in the cardiovascular system. Moreover, there is no widely recognized and general time-series augmentation method that can be applied across different tasks. In this paper, we propose a novel data augmentation method for time-series tasks that aims to connect intra-class samples together, and thereby find order in the latent space. Our method builds upon the well-known data augmentation technique of mixup by incorporating a novel approach that accounts for the non-stationary nature of time-series data. Also, by controlling the degree of chaos created by data augmentation, our method leads to improved feature representations and performance on downstream tasks. We evaluate our proposed method on three time-series tasks, including heart rate estimation, human activity recognition, and cardiovascular disease detection.

However, we observe these works achieve limited communication reduction for state-of-the-art (SOTA) 2PC protocols due to the ignorance of other linear and non-linear operations, which now contribute to the majority of communication.

While such an approach works well for tasks that only require forward reasoning (e.g., straightforward arithmetic), it is less effective for constraint solving problems that require more sophisticated planning and search. In this paper, we propose a new satisfiability-aided language modeling (SatLM) approach for improving the reasoning capabilities of LLMs. We use an LLM to generate a declarative task specification rather than an imperative program and leverage an off-the-shelf automated theorem prover to derive the final answer. This approach has two key advantages. The declarative specification is closer to the problem description than the reasoning steps are, so the LLM can parse it out of the description more accurately. Furthermore, by offloading the actual reasoning task to an automated theorem prover, our approach can guarantee the correctness of the answer with respect to the parsed specification and avoid planning errors in the solving process. We evaluate SATLM on 8 different datasets and show that it consistently outperforms program-aided LMs in the imperative paradigm. In particular, SATLM outperforms program-aided LMs by 23% on a challenging subset of the GSM arithmetic reasoning dataset; SATLM also achieves a new SoTA on LSAT and BoardgameQA, surpassing previous models that are trained on the respective training sets",

Here we show how results for nonequilibrium thermodynamics based on Jarzynski equality together with tools from sequential Monte-Carlo sampling can be used to perform this computation efficiently and avoid the uncontrolled approximations made using the standard contrastive divergence algorithm. Specifically, we introduce a modification of the unadjusted Langevin algorithm (ULA) in which each walker acquires a weight that enables the estimation of the gradient of the cross-entropy at any step during GD, thereby bypassing sampling biases induced by slow mixing of ULA. We illustrate these results with numerical experiments on Gaussian mixture distributions as well as the MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets.

    "abstract": "When interacting with people, AI agents do not just influence the state of the world -- they also influence the actions people take in response to the agent, and even their underlying intentions and strategies. Accounting for and leveraging this influence has mostly been studied in settings where it is sufficient to assume that human behavior is near-optimal: competitive games, or general-sum settings like autonomous driving alongside human drivers. Instead, we focus on influence in settings where there is a need to capture human suboptimality. For instance, imagine a collaborative task in which, due either to cognitive biases or lack of information, people do not perform very well -- how could an agent influence them towards more optimal behavior? Assuming near-optimal human behavior will not work here, and so the agent needs to learn from real human data. But experimenting online with humans is potentially unsafe, and creating a high-fidelity simulator of the environment is often impractical. Hence, we focus on learning from an offline dataset of human-human interactions. Our observation is that offline reinforcement learning (RL) can learn to effectively influence suboptimal humans by extending and combining elements of observed human-human behavior. We demonstrate that offline RL can solve two challenges with effective influence. First, we show that by learning from a dataset of suboptimal human-human interaction on a variety of tasks -- none of which contains examples of successful influence -- an agent can learn influence strategies to steer humans towards better performance even on new tasks. Second, we show that by also modeling and conditioning on human behavior, offline RL can learn to affect not just the human's actions but also their underlying strategy, and adapt to changes in their strategy",

    "abstract": "This work proposes a Momentum-Enabled Kronecker-Factor-Based Optimizer Using Rank-1 updates, called MKOR, that improves the training time and convergence properties of deep neural networks (DNNs). Second-order techniques, while enjoying higher convergence rates vs first-order counterparts, have cubic complexity with respect to either the model size and/or the training batch size. Hence they exhibit poor scalability and performance in transformer models, e.g. large language models (LLMs), because the batch sizes in these models scale by the attention mechanism sequence length, leading to large model size and batch sizes. MKOR's complexity is quadratic with respect to the model size, alleviating the computation bottlenecks in second-order methods. Because of their high computation complexity, state-of-the-art implementations of second-order methods can only afford to update the second order information infrequently, and thus do not fully exploit the promise of better convergence from these updates. By reducing the communication complexity of the second-order updates as well as achieving a linear communication complexity, MKOR increases the frequency of second order updates. We also propose a hybrid version of MKOR (called MKOR-H) that mid-training falls backs to a first order optimizer if the second order updates no longer accelerate convergence. Our experiments show that MKOR outperforms state -of-the-art first order methods, e.g. the LAMB optimizer, and best implementations of second-order methods, i.e. KAISA/KFAC, up to 2.57x and 1.85x respectively on BERT-Large-Uncased on 64 GPUs",

Instead, we propose a novel alternative approach that employs part-level representation, representing instances as combinations of detected parts. While our detect-then-group approach effectively handles instances with diverse part structures and various part counts, it faces issues of false positives, varying part sizes and scales, and an increasing model size due to end-to-end training. To address these challenges, we propose 1) test-time kinematics-aware part fusion to improve detection performance while suppressing false positives, 2) anisotropic scale normalization for part shape learning to accommodate various part sizes and scales, and 3) a balancing strategy for cross-refinement between feature space and output space to improve part detection while maintaining model size. Evaluation on both synthetic and real data demonstrates that our method successfully reconstructs variously structured multiple instances that previous works cannot handle, and outperforms prior works in shape reconstruction and kinematics estimation",

    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "Anti-spoofing detection has become a necessity for face recognition systems due to the security threat posed by spoofing attacks. Despite great success in traditional attacks, most deep-learning-based methods perform poorly in 3D masks, which can highly simulate real faces in appearance and structure, suffering generalizability insufficiency while focusing only on the spatial domain with single frame input. This has been mitigated by the recent introduction of a biomedical technology called rPPG (remote photoplethysmography). However, rPPG-based methods are sensitive to noisy interference and require at least one second (> 25 frames) of observation time, which induces high computational overhead. To address these challenges, we propose a novel 3D mask detection framework, called FASTEN (Flow-Attention-based Spatio-Temporal aggrEgation Network). We tailor the network for focusing more on fine-grained details in large movements, which can eliminate redundant spatio-temporal feature interference and quickly capture splicing traces of 3D masks in fewer frames. Our proposed network contains three key modules: 1) a facial optical flow network to obtain non-RGB inter-frame flow information; 2) flow attention to assign different significance to each frame; 3) spatio-temporal aggregation to aggregate high-level spatial features and temporal transition features. Through extensive experiments, FASTEN only requires five frames of input and outperforms eight competitors for both intra-dataset and cross-dataset evaluations in terms of multiple detection metrics. Moreover, FASTEN has been deployed in real-world mobile devices for practical 3D mask detection",

To address the unique challenges of **adversarial finite** action sets, we propose the FedSupLinUCB algorithm, which extends the principles of SupLinUCB and OFUL algorithms in linear contextual bandits. We prove that FedSupLinUCB achieves a total regret of $\\tilde{O}(\\sqrt{d T})$, where $T$ is the total number of arm pulls from all clients, and $d$ is the ambient dimension of the linear model. This matches the minimax lower bound and thus is order-optimal (up to polylog terms).

    "abstract": "Reinforcement Learning (RL) has been successful in various domains like robotics, game playing, and simulation. While RL agents have shown impressive capabilities in their specific tasks, they insufficiently adapt to new tasks. In supervised learning, this adaptation problem is addressed by large-scale pre-training followed by fine-tuning to new down-stream tasks. Recently, pre-training on multiple tasks has been gaining traction in RL. However, fine-tuning a pre-trained model often suffers from catastrophic forgetting. That is, the performance on the pre-training tasks deteriorates when fine-tuning on new tasks. To investigate the catastrophic forgetting phenomenon, we first jointly pre-train a model on datasets from two benchmark suites, namely Meta-World and DMControl. Then, we evaluate and compare a variety of fine-tuning methods prevalent in natural language processing, both in terms of performance on new tasks, and how well performance on pre-training tasks is retained. Our study shows that with most fine-tuning approaches, the performance on pre-training tasks deteriorates significantly. Therefore, we propose a novel method, Learning-to-Modulate (L2M), that avoids the degradation of learned skills by modulating the information flow of the frozen pre-trained model via a learnable modulation pool. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Continual-World benchmark, while retaining performance on the pre-training tasks. Finally, to aid future research in this area, we release a dataset encompassing 50 Meta-World and 16 DMControl tasks",

    "abstract": "The efficient coding hypothesis proposes that the response properties of sensory systems are adapted to the statistics of their inputs such that they capture maximal information about the environment, subject to biological constraints. While elegant, information theoretic properties are notoriously difficult to measure in practical settings or to employ as objective functions in optimization. This difficulty has necessitated that computational models designed to test the hypothesis employ several different information metrics ranging from approximations and lower bounds to proxy measures like reconstruction error. Recent theoretical advances have characterized a novel and ecologically relevant efficiency metric, the ``manifold capacity,\" which is the number of object categories that may be represented in a linearly separable fashion. However, calculating manifold capacity is a computationally intensive iterative procedure that until now has precluded its use as an objective. Here we outline the simplifying assumptions that allow manifold capacity to be optimized directly, yielding Maximum Manifold Capacity Representations (MMCR). The resulting method is closely related to and inspired by advances in the field of self supervised learning (SSL), and we demonstrate that MMCRs are competitive with state of the art results on standard SSL benchmarks. Empirical analyses reveal differences between MMCRs and representations learned by other SSL frameworks, and suggest a mechanism by which manifold compression gives rise to class separability. Finally we evaluate a set of SSL methods on a suite of neural predicitivity benchmarks, and find MMCRs are higly competitive as models of the ventral stream",

In this work, we argue that, while the inherent uncertainty in the extrapolation of learning curves warrants a Bayesian approach, existing methods are (i) overly restrictive, and/or (ii) computationally expensive. We describe the first application of prior-data fitted neural networks (PFNs) in this context. A PFN is a transformer, pre-trained on data generated from a prior, to perform approximate Bayesian inference in a single forward pass. We propose LC-PFN, a PFN trained to extrapolate 10 million artificial right-censored learning curves generated from a parametric prior proposed in prior art using MCMC. We demonstrate that LC-PFN can approximate the posterior predictive distribution more accurately than MCMC, while being over 10 000 times faster. We also show that the same LC-PFN achieves competitive performance extrapolating a total of 20 000 real learning curves from four learning curve benchmarks (LCBench, NAS-Bench-201, Taskset, and PD1) that stem from training a wide range of model architectures (MLPs, CNNs, RNNs, and Transformers) on 53 different datasets with varying input modalities (tabular, image, text, and protein data).

    "abstract": "DNN pruning is a popular way to reduce the size of a model, improve the inference latency, and minimize the power consumption on DNN accelerators. However, existing approaches might be too complex, expensive or ineffective to apply to a variety of vision/language tasks, DNN architectures and to honor structured pruning constraints. In this paper, we propose an efficient yet effective train-time pruning scheme, Parameter-free Differentiable Pruning (PDP), which offers state- of-the-art qualities in model size, accuracy, and training cost. PDP uses a dynamic function of weights during training to generate soft pruning masks for the weights in a parameter-free manner for a given pruning target. While differentiable, the simplicity and efficiency of PDP make it universal enough to deliver state-of-the-art random/structured/channel pruning results on various vision and natural language tasks. For example, for MobileNet-v1, PDP can achieve 68.2% top-1 ImageNet1k accuracy at 86.6% sparsity, which is 1.7% higher accuracy than those from the state-of-the-art algorithms. Also, PDP yields over 83.1% accuracy on Multi-Genre Natural Language Inference with 90% sparsity for BERT, while the next best from the existing techniques shows 81.5% accuracy. In addition, PDP can be applied to structured pruning, such as N:M pruning and channel pruning. For 1:4 structured pruning of ResNet18, PDP improved the top-1 ImageNet1k accuracy by over 3.6% over the state-of-the-art. For channel pruning of ResNet50, PDP reduced the top-1 ImageNet1k accuracy by 0.6% from the state-of-the-art",

    "abstract": "We present new insights and a novel paradigm for learning implicit neural representations (INR) of shapes. In particular, we shed light on the popular eikonal loss used for imposing a signed distance function constraint in INR. We show analytically that as the representation power of the network increases, the optimization approaches a partial differential equation (PDE) in the continuum limit that is unstable. We show that this instability can manifest in existing network optimization, leading to irregularities in the reconstructed surface and/or convergence to sub-optimal local minima, and thus fails to capture fine geometric and topological structure. We show analytically how other terms added to the loss, currently used in the literature for other purposes, can actually eliminate these instabilities. However, such terms can over-regularize the surface, preventing the representation of fine shape detail. Based on a similar PDE theory for the continuum limit, we introduce a new regularization term that still counteracts the eikonal instability but without over-regularizing. Furthermore, since stability is now guaranteed in the continuum limit, this stabilization also allows for considering new network structures that are able to represent finer shape detail. We introduce such a structure based on quadratic layers. Experiments on multiple benchmark data sets show that our new regularization and network are able to capture more precise shape details and more accurate topology than existing state-of-the-art",

However, although better than previous approaches in terms of memory usage, BT-RvNN can be still exorbitantly expensive. In this paper, we identify the main bottleneck in BT-RvNN's memory usage to be the entanglement of the scorer function and the recursive cell function. We propose strategies to remove this bottleneck and further simplify its memory usage. Overall, our strategies not only reduce the memory usage of BT-RvNN by $10-16$ times but also create a new state-of-the-art in ListOps while maintaining similar performance in other tasks.

In this work, we take a theoretical view on kernel ridge regression (KRR) based methods of dataset distillation such as Kernel Inducing Points. By transforming ridge regression in random Fourier features (RFF) space, we provide the first proof of the existence of small (size) distilled datasets and their corresponding excess risk for shift-invariant kernels. We prove that a small set of instances exists in the original input space such that its solution in the RFF space coincides with the solution of the original data. We further show that a KRR solution can be generated using this distilled set of instances which gives an approximation towards the KRR solution optimized on the full input data. The size of this set is linear in the dimension of the RFF space of the input set or alternatively near linear in the number of effective degrees of freedom, which is a function of the kernel, number of data points, and the regularization parameter $\\lambda$. The error bound of this distilled set is also a function of $\\lambda$. We verify our bounds analytically and empirically",

Whenever a user does not like a message, she may abandon the system with a probability positively correlated with the recommendation frequency. A learning agent needs to learn both the underlying message attraction probabilities and users' abandonment probabilities through the randomly delayed feedback. We first show a dynamic programming solution to finding the optimal message sequence in deterministic scenarios, in which the reward is allowed to vary with different messages. Then we propose a polynomial time UCB-based offline learning algorithm, and discuss its performance by characterizing its regret bound.

    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "This paper investigates posterior sampling algorithms for competitive reinforcement learning (RL) in the context of general function approximations. Focusing on zero-sum Markov games (MGs) under two critical settings, namely self-play and adversarial learning, we first propose the self-play and adversarial generalized eluder coefficient (GEC) as complexity measures for function approximation, capturing the exploration-exploitation trade-off in MGs. Based on self-play GEC, we propose a model-based self-play posterior sampling method to control both players to learn Nash equilibrium, which can successfully handle the partial observability of states. Furthermore, we identify a set of partially observable MG models fitting MG learning with the adversarial policies of the opponent. Incorporating the adversarial GEC, we propose a model-based posterior sampling method for learning adversarial MG with potential partial observability. We further provide low regret bounds for proposed algorithms that can scale sublinearly with the proposed GEC and the number of episodes $T$. To the best of our knowledge, we for the first time develop generic model-based posterior sampling algorithms for competitive RL that can be applied to a majority of tractable zero-sum MG classes in both fully observable and partially observable MGs with self-play and adversarial learning",

    "abstract": "Advances in generative models have recently revolutionised machine learning. Meanwhile, in neuroscience, generative models have long been thought fundamental to animal intelligence. Understanding the biological mechanisms that support these processes promises to shed light on the relationship between biological and artificial intelligence. In animals, the hippocampal formation is thought to learn and use a generative model to support its role in spatial and non-spatial memory. Here we introduce a biologically plausible model of the hippocampal formation tantamount to a Helmholtz machine that we apply to a temporal stream of inputs. A novel component of our model is that fast theta-band oscillations (5-10 Hz) gate the direction of information flow throughout the network, training it akin to a high-frequency wake-sleep algorithm. Our model accurately infers the latent state of high-dimensional sensory environments and generates realistic sensory predictions. Furthermore, it can learn to path integrate by developing a ring attractor connectivity structure matching previous theoretical proposals and flexibly transfer this structure between environments. Whereas many models trade-off biological plausibility with generality, our model captures a variety of hippocampal cognitive functions under one biologically plausible local learning rule",

    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "Informational parsimony provides a useful inductive bias for learning representations that achieve better generalization by being robust to noise and spurious correlations. We propose *information gating* as a way to learn parsimonious representations that identify the minimal information required for a task. When gating information, we can learn to reveal as little information as possible so that a task remains solvable, or hide as little information as possible so that a task becomes unsolvable. We gate information using a differentiable parameterization of the signal-to-noise ratio, which can be applied to arbitrary values in a network, e.g., erasing pixels at the input layer or activations in some intermediate layer. When gating at the input layer, our models learn which visual cues matter for a given task. When gating intermediate layers, our models learn which activations are needed for subsequent stages of computation. We call our approach *InfoGating*. We apply InfoGating to various objectives such as multi-step forward and inverse dynamics models, Q-learning, and behavior cloning, highlighting how InfoGating can naturally help in discarding information not relevant for control. Results show that learning to identify and use minimal information can improve generalization in downstream tasks. Policies based on InfoGating are considerably more robust to irrelevant visual features, leading to improved pretraining and finetuning of RL models",

    "title": "Recursion in Recursion: Two-Level Nested Recursion for Length Generalization with Scalability",
    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "Binary Balanced Tree Recursive Neural Networks (BBT-RvNNs) enforce sequence composition according to a preset balanced binary tree structure. Thus, their non-linear recursion depth (which is the tree depth) is just $\\log_2 n$ ($n$ being the sequence length). Such logarithmic scaling makes BBT-RvNNs efficient and scalable on long sequence tasks such as Long Range Arena (LRA). However, such computational efficiency comes at a cost because BBT-RvNNs cannot solve simple arithmetic tasks like ListOps. On the flip side, RvNN models (e.g., Beam Tree RvNN) that do succeed on ListOps (and other structure-sensitive tasks like formal logical inference) are generally several times more expensive (in time and space) than even Recurrent Neural Networks. In this paper, we introduce a novel framework --- Recursion in Recursion (RIR) to strike a balance between the two sides - getting some of the benefits from both worlds. In RIR, we use a form of two-level nested recursion - where the outer recursion is a $k$-ary balanced tree model with another recursive model (inner recursion) implementing its cell function. For the inner recursion, we choose Beam Tree RvNNs. To adjust Beam Tree RvNNs within RIR we also propose a novel strategy of beam alignment. Overall, this entails that the total recursive depth in RIR is upper-bounded by $k \\log_k n$. Our best RIR-based model is the first model that demonstrates high ($\\geq 90\\%$) length-generalization performance on ListOps while at the same time being scalable enough to be trainable on long sequence inputs from LRA (it can reduce the memory usage of the original Beam Tree RvNN by hundreds of times). Moreover, in terms of accuracy in the LRA language tasks, it performs competitively with Structured State Space Models (SSMs) without any special initialization - outperforming Transformers by a large margin. On the other hand, while SSMs can marginally outperform RIR on LRA, they (SSMs) fail to length-generalize on ListOps. Our code is available at: https://github.com/JRC1995/BeamRecursionFamily/",

In this work, we propose Factorized Transformer (FactFormer), which is based on an axial factorized kernel integral. Concretely, we introduce a learnable projection operator that decomposes the input function into multiple sub-functions with one-dimensional domain. These sub-functions are then evaluated and used to compute the instance-based kernel with an axial factorized scheme. We showcase that the proposed model is able to simulate 2D Kolmogorov flow on a $256\\times 256$ grid and 3D smoke buoyancy on a $64\\times64\\times64$ grid with good accuracy and efficiency.

However, current OPE methods, such as Inverse Probability Weighting (IPW) and Doubly Robust (DR) estimators, suffer from high variance, particularly in cases of low overlap between target and behaviour policies or large action and context spaces. In this paper, we introduce a new OPE estimator for contextual bandits, the Marginal Ratio (MR) estimator, which focuses on the shift in the marginal distribution of outcomes $Y$ instead of the policies themselves. Through rigorous theoretical analysis, we demonstrate the benefits of the MR estimator compared to conventional methods like IPW and DR in terms of variance reduction. Additionally, we establish a connection between the MR estimator and the state-of-the-art Marginalized Inverse Propensity Score (MIPS) estimator, proving that MR achieves lower variance among a generalized family of MIPS estimators. We further illustrate the utility of the MR estimator in causal inference settings, where it exhibits enhanced performance in estimating Average Treatment Effects (ATE).

Though each objective has been individually well-studied, i.e., best arm identification for (i) and regret minimization for (ii), the simultaneous realization of both objectives remains an open problem, despite its practical importance. This paper introduces \\emph{Regret Optimal Best Arm Identification} (ROBAI) which aims to achieve these dual objectives. To solve ROBAI with both pre-determined stopping time and adaptive stopping time requirements, we present an algorithm called EOCP and its variants respectively, which not only achieve asymptotic optimal regret in both Gaussian and general bandits, but also commit to the optimal arm in $\\mathcal{O}(\\log T)$ rounds with pre-determined stopping time and $\\mathcal{O}(\\log^2 T)$ rounds with adaptive stopping time. We further characterize lower bounds on the commitment time (equivalent to the sample complexity) of ROBAI, showing that EOCP and its variants are sample optimal with pre-determined stopping time, and almost sample optimal with adaptive stopping time. Numerical results confirm our theoretical analysis and reveal an interesting ``over-exploration'' phenomenon carried by classic UCB algorithms, such that EOCP has smaller regret even though it stops exploration much earlier than UCB, i.e., $\\mathcal{O}(\\log T)$ versus $\\mathcal{O}(T)$, which suggests over-exploration is unnecessary and potentially harmful to system performance",

Building a graph hierarchy via graph pooling methods is a promising approach to address this challenge; however, hierarchical information propagation cannot entirely take over the role of local information aggregation. To balance locality and hierarchy, we integrate the local and hierarchical structures, represented by intra- and inter-graphs respectively, of a multi-scale graph hierarchy into a single mega graph. Our proposed MeGraph model consists of multiple layers alternating between local and hierarchical information aggregation on the mega graph. Each layer first performs local-aware message-passing on graphs of varied scales via the intra-graph edges, then fuses information across the entire hierarchy along the bidirectional pathways formed by inter-graph edges. By repeating this fusion process, local and hierarchical information could intertwine and complement each other. To evaluate our model, we establish a new Graph Theory Benchmark designed to assess LRI capture ability, in which MeGraph demonstrates dominant performance. Furthermore, MeGraph exhibits superior or equivalent performance to state-of-the-art models on the Long Range Graph Benchmark.

Though large-scale data collections invariably contain annotation noise and numerous robust learning methods have been developed, data pruning for the noise-robust learning scenario has received little attention. With state-of-the-art Re-labeling methods that self-correct erroneous labels while training, it is challenging to identify which subset induces the most accurate re-labeling of erroneous labels in the entire training set. In this paper, we formalize the problem of data pruning with re-labeling. We first show that the likelihood of a training example being correctly re-labeled is proportional to the prediction confidence of its neighborhood in the subset. Therefore, we propose a novel data pruning algorithm, Prune4Rel, that finds a subset maximizing the total neighborhood confidence of all training examples, thereby maximizing the re-labeling accuracy and generalization performance. Extensive experiments on four real and one synthetic noisy datasets show that Prune4Rel outperforms the baselines with Re-labeling models by up to 9.1% as well as those with a standard model by up to 21.6%",

By re-parametrizing the offset DEC with the confidence radius and solving the corresponding min-max program, we derive an anytime variant of the Estimation-To-Decisions algorithm (Anytime-E2D).

Our formulation leads to a practical algorithm for finite model classes and linear feedback models. We illustrate the results by deriving improved rates for high-dimensional linear bandits.

    "abstract": "Recent advances in graph neural networks (GNNs) have enabled more comprehensive modeling of molecules and molecular systems, thereby enhancing the precision of molecular property prediction and molecular simulations. Nonetheless, as the field has been progressing to bigger and more complex architectures, state-of-the-art GNNs have become largely prohibitive for many large-scale applications. In this paper, we explore the utility of knowledge distillation (KD) for accelerating molecular GNNs. To this end, we devise KD strategies that facilitate the distillation of hidden representations in directional and equivariant GNNs, and evaluate their performance on the regression task of energy and force prediction. We validate our protocols across different teacher-student configurations and datasets, and demonstrate that they can consistently boost the predictive accuracy of student models without any modifications to their architecture. Moreover, we conduct comprehensive optimization of various components of our framework, and investigate the potential of data augmentation to further enhance performance. All in all, we manage to close the gap in predictive accuracy between teacher and student models by as much as 96.7\\% and 62.5\\% for energy and force prediction respectively, while fully preserving the inference throughput of the more lightweight models",

    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "Despite its practical importance across a wide range of modalities, recent advances in self-supervised learning (SSL) have been primarily focused on a few well-curated domains, e.g., vision and language, often relying on their domain-specific knowledge. For example, Masked Auto-Encoder (MAE) has become one of the popular architectures in these domains, but less has explored its potential in other modalities. In this paper, we develop MAE as a unified, modality-agnostic SSL framework. In turn, we argue meta-learning as a key to interpreting MAE as a modality-agnostic learner, and propose enhancements to MAE from the motivation to jointly improve its SSL across diverse modalities, coined MetaMAE as a result. Our key idea is to view the mask reconstruction of MAE as a meta-learning task: masked tokens are predicted by adapting the Transformer meta-learner through the amortization of unmasked tokens. Based on this novel interpretation, we propose to integrate two advanced meta-learning techniques. First, we adapt the amortized latent of the Transformer encoder using gradient-based meta-learning to enhance the reconstruction. Then, we maximize the alignment between amortized and adapted latents through task contrastive learning which guides the Transformer encoder to better encode the task-specific knowledge. Our experiment demonstrates the superiority of MetaMAE in the modality-agnostic SSL benchmark (called DABS), significantly outperforming prior baselines",

We propose a novel formulation of the problem as Partial Matrix Completion, where the objective is to complete a substantial subset of the entries with high confidence. Our algorithm efficiently handles the unknown and arbitrarily complex nature of the sampling distribution, ensuring high accuracy for all completed entries and sufficient coverage across the matrix.

    "abstract": "Actor-critic (AC) methods are widely used in reinforcement learning (RL), and benefit from the flexibility of using any policy gradient method as the actor and value-based method as the critic. The critic is usually trained by minimizing the TD error, an objective that is potentially decorrelated with the true goal of achieving a high reward with the actor. We address this mismatch by designing a joint objective for training the actor and critic in a decision-aware fashion. We use the proposed objective to design a generic, AC algorithm that can easily handle any function approximation. We explicitly characterize the conditions under which the resulting algorithm guarantees monotonic policy improvement, regardless of the choice of the policy and critic parameterization. Instantiating the generic algorithm results in an actor that involves maximizing a sequence of surrogate functions (similar to TRPO, PPO), and a critic that involves minimizing a closely connected objective. Using simple bandit examples, we provably establish the benefit of the proposed critic objective over the standard squared error. Finally, we empirically demonstrate the benefit of our decision-aware actor-critic framework on simple RL problems",

    "abstract": "We propose a novel framework for analyzing the dynamics of distribution shift in real-world systems that captures the feedback loop between learning algorithms and the distributions on which they are deployed. Prior work largely models feedback-induced distribution shift as adversarial or via an overly simplistic distribution-shift structure. In contrast, we propose a coupled partial differential equation model that captures fine-grained changes in the distribution over time by accounting for complex dynamics that arise due to strategic responses to algorithmic decision-making, non-local endogenous population interactions, and other exogenous sources of distribution shift. We consider two common settings in machine learning: cooperative settings with information asymmetries, and competitive settings where a learner faces strategic users. For both of these settings, when the algorithm retrains via gradient descent, we prove asymptotic convergence of the retraining procedure to a steady-state, both in finite and in infinite dimensions, obtaining explicit rates in terms of the model parameters. To do so we derive new results on the convergence of coupled PDEs that extends what is known on multi-species systems. Empirically, we show that our approach captures well-documented forms of distribution shifts like polarization and disparate impacts that simpler models cannot capture",

    "abstract": "With a rapid growth in the deployment of AI tools for making critical decisions (or aiding humans in doing so), there is a growing demand to be able to explain to the stakeholders how these tools arrive at a decision. Consequently, voting is frequently used to make such decisions due to its inherent explainability. Recent work suggests that using randomized (as opposed to deterministic) voting rules can lead to significant efficiency gains measured via the distortion framework. However, rules that use intricate randomization can often become too complex to explain to the stakeholders; losing explainability can eliminate the key advantage of voting over black-box AI tools, which may outweigh the efficiency gains. We study the efficiency gains which can be unlocked by using voting rules that add a simple randomization step to a deterministic rule, thereby retaining explainability. We focus on two such families of rules, randomized positional scoring rules and random committee member rules, and show, theoretically and empirically, that they indeed achieve explainability and efficiency simultaneously to some extent",

    "abstract": "This paper presents FreD, a novel parameterization method for dataset distillation, which utilizes the frequency domain to distill a small-sized synthetic dataset from a large-sized original dataset. Unlike conventional approaches that focus on the spatial domain, FreD employs frequency-based transforms to optimize the frequency representations of each data instance. By leveraging the concentration of spatial domain information on specific frequency components, FreD intelligently selects a subset of frequency dimensions for optimization, leading to a significant reduction in the required budget for synthesizing an instance. Through the selection of frequency dimensions based on the explained variance, FreD demonstrates both theoretical and empirical evidence of its ability to operate efficiently within a limited budget, while better preserving the information of the original dataset compared to conventional parameterization methods. Furthermore, Based on the orthogonal compatibility of FreD with existing methods, we confirm that FreD consistently improves the performances of existing distillation methods over the evaluation scenarios with different benchmark datasets.

    "abstract": "As machine learning agents act more autonomously in the world, they will increasingly interact with each other. Unfortunately, in many social dilemmas like the one-shot Prisoner's Dilemma, standard game theory predicts that ML agents will fail to cooperate with each other. Prior work has shown that one way to enable cooperative outcomes in the one-shot Prisoner's Dilemma is to make the agents mutually transparent to each other, i.e., to allow them to access one another's source code (Rubinstein, 1998; Tennenholtz, 2004) – or weights in the case of ML agents. However, full transparency is often unrealistic, whereas partial transparency is commonplace. Moreover, it is challenging for agents to learn their way to cooperation in the full transparency setting. In this paper, we introduce a more realistic setting in which agents only observe a single number indicating how similar they are to each other. We prove that this allows for the same set of cooperative outcomes as the full transparency setting. We also demonstrate experimentally that cooperation can be learned using simple ML methods",

Estimators such as principal component regression (PCR) or reduced rank regression (RRR) in kernel spaces can be shown to provably learn Koopman operators from finite empirical observations of the system's time evolution. Scaling these approaches to very long trajectories is a challenge and requires introducing suitable approximations to make computations feasible. In this paper, we boost the efficiency of different kernel-based Koopman operator estimators using random projections (sketching). We derive, implement and test the new ``sketched'' estimators with extensive experiments on synthetic and large-scale molecular dynamics datasets. Further, we establish non asymptotic error bounds giving a sharp characterization of the trade-offs between statistical learning rates and computational efficiency. Our empirical and theoretical analysis shows that the proposed estimators provide a sound and efficient way to learn large scale dynamical systems. In particular our experiments indicate that the proposed estimators retain the same accuracy of PCR or RRR, while being much faster",

    "abstract": "Fourier neural operators (FNOs) can learn highly nonlinear mappings between function spaces, and have recently become a popular tool for learning responses of complex physical systems. However, to achieve good accuracy and efficiency, FNOs rely on the Fast Fourier transform (FFT), which is restricted to modeling problems on rectangular domains. To lift such a restriction and permit FFT on irregular geometries as well as topology changes, we introduce domain agnostic Fourier neural operator (DAFNO), a novel neural operator architecture for learning surrogates with irregular geometries and evolving domains. The key idea is to incorporate a smoothed characteristic function in the integral layer architecture of FNOs, and leverage FFT to achieve rapid computations, in such a way that the geometric information is explicitly encoded in the architecture. In our empirical evaluation, DAFNO has achieved state-of-the-art accuracy as compared to baseline neural operator models on two benchmark datasets of material modeling and airfoil simulation. To further demonstrate the capability and generalizability of DAFNO in handling complex domains with topology changes, we consider a brittle material fracture evolution problem. With only one training crack simulation sample, DAFNO has achieved generalizability to unseen loading scenarios and substantially different crack patterns from the trained scenario.

Its potential applications include identifying hot spots of rare wildlife poaching activity, search-and-rescue scenarios, identifying illegal trafficking of weapons, drugs, or people, and many others. State of the art approaches to VAS include applications of deep reinforcement learning (DRL), which yield end-to-end search policies, and traditional active search, which combines predictions with custom algorithmic approaches. While the DRL framework has been shown to greatly outperform traditional active search in such domains, its end-to-end nature does not make full use of supervised information attained either during training, or during actual search, a significant limitation if search tasks differ significantly from those in the training distribution. We propose an approach that combines the strength of both DRL and conventional active search approaches by decomposing the search policy into a prediction module, which produces a geospatial distribution of regions of interest based on task embedding and search history, and a search module, which takes the predictions and search history as input and outputs the search distribution. In addition, we develop a novel meta-learning approach for jointly learning the resulting combined policy that can make effective use of supervised information obtained both at training and decision time.

However, existing value-based approaches (e.g., Shapley) are known to suffer from the stochasticity inherent in utility functions that render consistent and reliable ranking difficult. Recently, Wang and Jia (2023) proposed the noise-structure-agnostic framework to advocate the Banzhaf value for its robustness against such stochasticity as it achieves the largest safe margin among many alternatives. Surprisingly, our empirical study shows that the Banzhaf value is not always the most robust when compared with a broader family: weighted Banzhaf values. To analyze this scenario, we introduce the concept of Kronecker noise to parameterize stochasticity, through which we prove that the uniquely robust semi-value, which can be analytically derived from the underlying Kronecker noise, lies in the family of weighted Banzhaf values while minimizing the worst-case entropy. In addition, we adopt the maximum sample reuse principle to design an estimator to efficiently approximate weighted Banzhaf values, and show that it enjoys the best time complexity in terms of achieving an $(\\epsilon, \\delta)$-approximation. Our theory is verified under both synthetic and authentic noises. For the latter, we fit a Kronecker noise to the inherent stochasticity, which is then plugged in to generate the predicted most robust semi-value.

    "abstract": "Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) are a popular approach for safe control of nonlinear systems. In CBF-based control, the desired safety properties of the system are mapped to nonnegativity of a CBF, and the control input is chosen to ensure that the CBF remains nonnegative for all time. Recently, machine learning methods that represent CBFs as neural networks (neural control barrier functions, or NCBFs) have shown great promise due to the universal representability of neural networks. However, verifying that a learned CBF guarantees safety remains a challenging research problem. This paper presents novel exact conditions and algorithms for verifying safety of feedforward NCBFs with ReLU activation functions. The key challenge in doing so is that, due to the piecewise linearity of the ReLU function, the NCBF will be nondifferentiable at certain points, thus invalidating traditional safety verification methods that assume a smooth barrier function. We resolve this issue by leveraging a generalization of Nagumo's theorem for proving invariance of sets with nonsmooth boundaries to derive necessary and sufficient conditions for safety. Based on this condition, we propose an algorithm for safety verification of NCBFs that first decomposes the NCBF into piecewise linear segments and then solves a nonlinear program to verify safety of each segment as well as the intersections of the linear segments. We mitigate the complexity by only considering the boundary of the safe region and by pruning the segments with Interval Bound Propagation (IBP) and linear relaxation.

To tackle the issue of inadequate attention to partial observations, we propose to first learn an environment embedding space that can implicitly evaluate the impacts of each program token based on the precondition. Furthermore, by employing a graph structure, the model can aggregate both environmental and syntactic information flow and furnish smooth program rectification guidance.

Starting from a direct MDP formulation of a constructive method, we introduce a generic way to reduce the state space, based on Bisimulation Quotienting (BQ) in MDPs. Then, for COPs with a recursive nature, we specialize the bisimulation and show how the reduced state exploits the symmetries of these problems and facilitates MDP solving. Our approach is principled and we prove that an optimal policy for the proposed BQ-MDP actually solves the associated COPs. We illustrate our approach on five classical problems: the Euclidean and Asymmetric Traveling Salesman, Capacitated Vehicle Routing, Orienteering and Knapsack Problems. Furthermore, for each problem, we introduce a simple attention-based policy network for the BQ-MDPs, which we train by imitation of (near) optimal solutions of small instances from a single distribution. We obtain new state-of-the-art results for the five COPs on both synthetic and realistic benchmarks. Notably, in contrast to most existing neural approaches, our learned policies show excellent generalization performance to much larger instances than seen during training, without any additional search procedure.

    "abstract": "Regardless of the particular task we want to perform in an environment, there are often shared safety constraints we want our agents to respect. For example, regardless of whether it is making a sandwich or clearing the table, a kitchen robot should not break a plate. Manually specifying such a constraint can be both time-consuming and error-prone. We show how to learn constraints from expert demonstrations of safe task completion by extending inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) techniques to the space of constraints. Intuitively, we learn constraints that forbid highly rewarding behavior that the expert could have taken but chose not to. Unfortunately, the constraint learning problem is rather ill-posed and typically leads to overly conservative constraints that forbid all behavior that the expert did not take. We counter this by leveraging diverse demonstrations that naturally occur in multi-task setting to learn a tighter set of constraints. We validate our method with simulation experiments on high-dimensional continuous control tasks",

    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "How neuronal circuits achieve credit assignment remains a central unsolved question in systems neuroscience. Various studies have suggested plausible solutions for back-propagating error signals through multi-layer networks. These purely functionally motivated models assume distinct neuronal compartments to represent local error signals that determine the sign of synaptic plasticity. However, this explicit error modulation is inconsistent with phenomenological plasticity models in which the sign depends primarily on postsynaptic activity. Here we show how a plausible microcircuit model and Hebbian learning rule derived within an adaptive control theory framework can resolve this discrepancy. Assuming errors are encoded in top-down dis-inhibitory synaptic afferents, we show that error-modulated learning emerges naturally at the circuit level when recurrent inhibition explicitly influences Hebbian plasticity. The same learning rule accounts for experimentally observed plasticity in the absence of inhibition and performs comparably to back-propagation of error (BP) on several non-linearly separable benchmarks. Our findings bridge the gap between functional and experimentally observed plasticity rules and make concrete predictions on inhibitory modulation of excitatory plasticity",

    "abstract": "In this work, we decouple the iterative bi-level offline RL (value estimation and policy extraction) from the offline training phase, forming a non-iterative bi-level paradigm and avoiding the iterative error propagation over two levels. Specifically, this non-iterative paradigm allows us to conduct inner-level optimization (value estimation) in training, while performing outer-level optimization (policy extraction) in testing. Naturally, such a paradigm raises three core questions that are not fully answered by prior non-iterative offline RL counterparts like reward-conditioned policy: (q1) What information should we transfer from the inner-level to the outer-level? (q2) What should we pay attention to when exploiting the transferred information for safe/confident outer-level optimization? (q3) What are the benefits of concurrently conducting outer-level optimization during testing? Motivated by model-based optimization (MBO), we propose DROP (design from policies), which fully answers the above questions. Specifically, in the inner-level, DROP decomposes offline data into multiple subsets, and learns an MBO score model (a1). To keep safe exploitation to the score model in the outer-level, we explicitly learn a behavior embedding and introduce a conservative regularization (a2). During testing, we show that DROP permits deployment adaptation, enabling an adaptive inference across states (a3). Empirically, we evaluate DROP on various tasks, showing that DROP gains comparable or better performance compared to prior methods",

However, non-Cartesian approaches are virtually unexplored in machine learning. This is likely due to the difficulties in the representation of data on non-Cartesian domains and the lack of support for standard machine learning operations on non-Cartesian data. This paper proposes a new data structure called the lattice tensor which generalizes traditional tensor spatio-temporal operations to lattice tensors, enabling the use of standard machine learning algorithms on non-Cartesian data. However, data need not reside on a non-Cartesian structure, we use non-Dyadic downsampling schemes to bring Cartesian data into a non-Cartesian space for further processing. We introduce a software library that implements the lattice tensor container (with some common machine learning operations), and demonstrate its effectiveness. Our method provides a general framework for machine learning on non-Cartesian domains, addressing the challenges mentioned above and filling a gap in the current literature",

Rashomon ratios are often large for tabular datasets in criminal justice, healthcare, lending, education, and in other areas, which has practical implications about whether simpler models can attain the same level of accuracy as more complex models. An open question is why Rashomon ratios often tend to be large. In this work, we propose and study a mechanism of the data generation process, coupled with choices usually made by the analyst during the learning process, that determines the size of the Rashomon ratio. Specifically, we demonstrate that noisier datasets lead to larger Rashomon ratios through the way that practitioners train models. Additionally, we introduce a measure called pattern diversity, which captures the average difference in predictions between distinct classification patterns in the Rashomon set, and motivate why it tends to increase with label noise. Our results explain a key aspect of why simpler models often tend to perform as well as black box models on complex, noisier datasets",

This problem setting corresponds to various real-world scenarios, where satisfying safety constraints is more important than maximizing the expected return. However, it is very challenging to learn the policy to avoid constraint-violating (i.e. non-preferred) behavior, as opposed to standard imitation learning which learns the policy to mimic given demonstrations. In this paper, we present a hyperparameter-free offline safe IL algorithm, SafeDICE, that learns safe policy by leveraging the non-preferred demonstrations in the space of stationary distributions. Our algorithm directly estimates the stationary distribution corrections of the policy that imitate the demonstrations excluding the non-preferred behavior. In the experiments, we demonstrate that our algorithm learns a more safe policy that satisfies the cost constraint without degrading the reward performance, compared to baseline algorithms",

We motivate our loss through the geometry of batch normed representations and their concentration of norm on a hypersphere and distributional proximity to Gaussians. Our losses expand intermediate latent based attacks that usually require labels. The success of our method implies that leakage of intermediate representations may create a security breach for deployed models, which persists even when the model is transferred to downstream usage. Removal of batch norm weakens our attack, indicating it contributes to this vulnerability.

Even in linear models, the Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) estimator may fail to exhibit asymptotic normality for single coordinate estimation and have inflated error. This issue is highlighted by a recent minimax lower bound, which shows that the error of estimating a single coordinate can be enlarged by a multiple of $\\sqrt{d}$ when data are allowed to be arbitrarily adaptive, compared with the case when they are i.i.d. Our work explores this striking difference in estimation performance between utilizing i.i.d. and adaptive data. We investigate how the degree of adaptivity in data collection impacts the performance of estimating a low-dimensional parameter component in high-dimensional linear models. We identify conditions on the data collection mechanism under which the estimation error for a low-dimensional parameter component matches its counterpart in the i.i.d. setting, up to a factor that depends on the degree of adaptivity. We show that OLS or OLS on centered data can achieve this matching error. In addition, we propose a novel estimator for single coordinate inference via solving a Two-stage Adaptive Linear Estimating equation (TALE). Under a weaker form of adaptivity in data collection, we establish an asymptotic normality property of the proposed estimator",

    "abstract": "As a powerful framework for graph representation learning, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have garnered significant attention in recent years. However, to the best of our knowledge, there has been no formal analysis of the logical expressiveness of GNNs as Boolean node classifiers over multi-relational graphs, where each edge carries a specific relation type. In this paper, we investigate $\\mathcal{FOC}_2$, a fragment of first-order logic with two variables and counting quantifiers. On the negative side, we demonstrate that the R$^2$-GNN architecture, which extends the local message passing GNN by incorporating global readout, fails to capture $\\mathcal{FOC}_2$ classifiers in the general case. Nevertheless, on the positive side, we establish that R$^2$-GNNs models are equivalent to $\\mathcal{FOC}_2$ classifiers under certain restricted yet reasonable scenarios. To address the limitations of R$^2$-GNNs regarding expressiveness, we propose a simple graph transformation technique, akin to a preprocessing step, which can be executed in linear time. This transformation enables R$^2$-GNNs to effectively capture any $\\mathcal{FOC}_2$ classifiers when applied to the \"transformed\" input graph. Moreover, we extend our analysis of expressiveness and graph transformation to temporal graphs, exploring several temporal GNN architectures and providing an expressiveness hierarchy for them. To validate our findings, we implement R$^2$-GNNs and the graph transformation technique and conduct empirical tests in node classification tasks against various well-known GNN architectures that support multi-relational or temporal graphs. Our experimental results consistently demonstrate that R$^2$-GNN with the graph transformation outperforms the baseline methods on both synthetic and real-world datasets",

    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "Topological data analysis (TDA) is an area of data science that focuses on using invariants from algebraic topology to provide multiscale shape descriptors for geometric data sets such as point clouds. One of the most important such descriptors is persistent homology, which encodes the change in shape as a filtration parameter changes; a typical parameter is the feature scale. For many data sets, it is useful to simultaneously vary multiple filtration parameters, for example feature scale and density. While the theoretical properties of single parameter persistent homology are well understood, less is known about the multiparameter case. A central question is the problem of representing multiparameter persistent homology by elements of a vector space for integration with standard machine learning algorithms. Existing approaches to this problem either ignore most of the multiparameter information to reduce to the one-parameter case or are heuristic and potentially unstable in the face of noise. In this article, we introduce a new general representation framework that leverages recent results on decompositions of multiparameter persistent homology. This framework is rich in information, fast to compute, and encompasses previous approaches. Moreover, we establish theoretical stability guarantees under this framework as well as efficient algorithms for practical computation, making this framework an applicable and versatile tool for analyzing geometric and point cloud data. We validate our stability results and algorithms with numerical experiments that demonstrate statistical convergence, prediction accuracy, and fast running times on several real data sets",

    "abstract": "Recent algorithms have achieved superhuman performance at a number of two-player zero-sum games such as poker and go. However, many real-world situations are multi-player games. Zero-sum two-team games, such as bridge and football, involve two teams where each member of the team shares the same reward with every other member of that team, and each team has the negative of the reward of the other team. A popular solution concept in this setting, called TMECor, assumes that teams can jointly correlate their strategies before play, but are not able to communicate during play. This setting is harder than two-player zero-sum games because each player on a team has different information and must use their public actions to signal to other members of the team. Prior works either have game-theoretic guarantees but only work in very small games, or are able to scale to large games but do not have game-theoretic guarantees. In this paper we introduce two algorithms: Team-PSRO, an extension of PSRO from two-player games to team games, and Team-PSRO Mix-and-Match which improves upon Team PSRO by better using population policies. In Team-PSRO, in every iteration both teams learn a joint best response to the opponent's meta-strategy via reinforcement learning. As the reinforcement learning joint best response approaches the optimal best response, Team-PSRO is guaranteed to converge to a TMECor. In experiments on Kuhn poker and Liar's Dice, we show that a tabular version of Team-PSRO converges to TMECor, and a version of Team PSRO using deep cooperative reinforcement learning beats self-play reinforcement learning in the large game of Google Research Football",

Flow matching, therefore, enables exact density evaluation, fast training, and seamless scalability to large architectures---making it ideal for SBI.

    "abstract": "Algebraic varieties are the geometric shapes defined by systems of polynomial equations; they are ubiquitous across mathematics and science. Amongst these algebraic varieties are Q-Fano varieties: positively curved shapes which have Q-factorial terminal singularities. Q-Fano varieties are of fundamental importance in geometry as they are `atomic pieces' of more complex shapes – the process of breaking a shape into simpler pieces in this sense is called the Minimal Model Programme. Despite their importance, the classification of Q-Fano varieties remains unknown. In this paper we demonstrate that machine learning can be used to understand this classification. We focus on eight-dimensional positively-curved algebraic varieties that have toric symmetry and Picard rank two, and develop a neural network classifier that predicts with 95% accuracy whether or not such an algebraic variety is Q-Fano. We use this to give a first sketch of the landscape of Q-Fano varieties in dimension eight. How the neural network is able to detect Q-Fano varieties with such accuracy remains mysterious, and hints at some deep mathematical theory waiting to be uncovered. Furthermore, when visualised using the quantum period, an invariant that has played an important role in recent theoretical developments, we observe that the classification as revealed by ML appears to fall within a bounded region, and is stratified by the Fano index. This suggests that it may be possible to state and prove conjectures on completeness in the future. Inspired by the ML analysis, we formulate and prove a new global combinatorial criterion for a positively curved toric variety of Picard rank two to have terminal singularities. Together with the first sketch of the landscape of Q-Fano varieties in higher dimensions, this gives strong new evidence that machine learning can be an essential tool in developing mathematical conjectures and accelerating theoretical discovery",

To facilitate this performance, we propose procedures for effectively tokenizing time series data and converting discrete distributions over tokens into highly flexible densities over continuous values. We argue the success of LLMs for time series stems from their ability to naturally represent multimodal distributions, in conjunction with biases for simplicity, and repetition, which align with the salient features in many time series, such as repeated seasonal trends. We also show how LLMs can naturally handle missing data without imputation through non-numerical text, accommodate textual side information, and answer questions to help explain predictions. While we find that increasing model size generally improves performance on time series, we show GPT-4 can perform worse than GPT-3 because of how it tokenizes numbers, and poor uncertainty calibration, which is likely the result of alignment interventions such as RLHF",

    "title": "Robust Mean Estimation Without Moments for Symmetric Distributions",
    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "We study the problem of robustly estimating the mean or location parameter without moment assumptions. Known computationally efficient algorithms rely on strong distributional assumptions, such as sub-Gaussianity, or (certifiably) bounded moments. Moreover, the guarantees that they achieve in the heavy-tailed setting are weaker than those for sub-Gaussian distributions with known covariance. In this work, we show that such a tradeoff, between error guarantees and heavy-tails, is not necessary for symmetric distributions. We show that for a large class of symmetric distributions, the same error as in the Gaussian setting can be achieved efficiently. The distributions we study include products of arbitrary symmetric one-dimensional distributions, such as product Cauchy distributions, as well as elliptical distributions, a vast generalization of the Gaussian distribution. For product distributions and elliptical distributions with known scatter (covariance) matrix, we show that given an $\\varepsilon$-corrupted sample, we can with probability at least $1-\\delta$ estimate its location up to error $O(\\varepsilon \\sqrt{\\log(1/\\varepsilon)})$ using $\\tfrac{d\\log(d) + \\log(1/\\delta)}{\\varepsilon^2 \\log(1/\\varepsilon)}$ samples. This result matches the best-known guarantees for the Gaussian distribution and known SQ lower bounds (up to the $\\log(d)$ factor). For elliptical distributions with unknown scatter (covariance) matrix, we propose a sequence of efficient algorithms that approaches this optimal error. Specifically, for every $k \\in \\mathbb{N}$, we design an estimator using time and samples $\\tilde{O}({d^k})$ achieving error $O(\\varepsilon^{1-\\frac{1}{2k}})$. This matches the error and running time guarantees when assuming certifiably bounded moments of order up to $k$. For unknown covariance, such error bounds of $o(\\sqrt{\\varepsilon})$ are not even known for (general) sub-Gaussian distributions. Our algorithms are based on a generalization of the well-known filtering technique [DK22]. More specifically, we show how this machinery can be combined with Huber-loss-based techniques to work with projections of the noise that behave more nicely than the initial noise. Moreover, we show how sum-of-squares proofs can be used to obtain algorithmic guarantees even for distributions without a first moment. We believe that this approach may find other applications in future works",

We compute finite depth corrections to this result, revealing a measure $R^{(1)}$ of regularity which bounds the pseudo-determinant of the Jacobian $\\left\\|Jf(x)\\right\\|\\_\\+$ and is subadditive under composition and addition. This formalizes a balance between learning low-dimensional representations and minimizing complexity/irregularity in the feature maps, allowing the network to learn the `right' inner dimension.

    "title": "Causal Effect Regularization: Automated Detection and Removal of Spurious Correlations",

    "abstract": "In many classification datasets, the task labels are spuriously correlated with some input attributes. Classifiers trained on such datasets often rely on these attributes for prediction, especially when the spurious correlation is high, and thus fail to generalize whenever there is a shift in the attributes' correlation at deployment. If we assume that the spurious attributes are known a priori, several methods have been proposed to learn a classifier that is invariant to the specified attributes. However, in real-world data, information about spurious attributes is typically unavailable. Therefore, we propose a method to automatically identify spurious attributes by estimating their causal effect on the label and then use a regularization objective to mitigate the classifier's reliance on them. Compared to a recent method for identifying spurious attributes, we find that our method is more accurate in removing the attribute from the learned model, especially when spurious correlation is high. Specifically, across synthetic, semi-synthetic, and real-world datasets, our method shows significant improvement in a metric used to quantify the dependence of a classifier on spurious attributes ($\\Delta$Prob), while obtaining better or similar accuracy. In addition, our method mitigates the reliance on spurious attributes even under noisy estimation of causal effects. To explain the empirical robustness of our method, we create a simple linear classification task with two sets of attributes: causal and spurious. We prove that our method only requires that the ranking of estimated causal effects is correct across attributes to select the correct classifier",

    "title": "Max-Sliced Mutual Information",

    "abstract": "Quantifying dependence between high-dimensional random variables is central to statistical learning and inference. Two classical methods are canonical correlation analysis (CCA), which identifies maximally correlated projected versions of the original variables, and Shannon's mutual information, which is a universal dependence measure that also captures high-order dependencies. However, CCA only accounts for linear dependence, which may be insufficient for certain applications, while mutual information is often infeasible to compute/estimate in high dimensions. This work proposes a middle ground in the form of a scalable information-theoretic generalization of CCA, termed max-sliced mutual information (mSMI). mSMI equals the maximal mutual information between low-dimensional projections of the high-dimensional variables, which reduces back to CCA in the Gaussian case. It enjoys the best of both worlds: capturing intricate dependencies in the data while being amenable to fast computation and scalable estimation from samples. We show that mSMI retains favorable structural properties of Shannon's mutual information, like variational forms and identification of independence. We then study statistical estimation of mSMI, propose an efficiently computable neural estimator, and couple it with formal non-asymptotic error bounds. We present experiments that demonstrate the utility of mSMI for several tasks, encompassing independence testing, multi-view representation learning, algorithmic fairness, and generative modeling. We observe that mSMI consistently outperforms competing methods with little-to-no computational overhead",

Previous approaches to approximate this quantity can be arbitrarily poor, leading to algorithms that do not implement genuine statistical inference and consequently do not perform well in challenging problems. In this work, we undertake a rigorous Bayesian treatment of the posterior probability of state-action optimality and clarify how it flows through the MDP. We first reveal that this quantity can indeed be used to generate a policy that explores efficiently, as measured by regret. Unfortunately, computing it is intractable, so we derive a new variational Bayesian approximation yielding a tractable convex optimization problem and establish that the resulting policy also explores efficiently. We call our approach VAPOR and show that it has strong connections to Thompson sampling, K-learning, and maximum entropy exploration.

    "abstract": "Training recurrent neural networks (RNNs) has become a go-to approach for generating and evaluating mechanistic neural hypotheses for cognition. The ease and efficiency of training RNNs with backpropagation through time and the availability of robustly supported deep learning libraries has made RNN modeling more approachable and accessible to neuroscience. Yet, a major technical hindrance remains. Cognitive processes such as working memory and decision making involve neural population dynamics over a long period of time within a behavioral trial and across trials. It is difficult to train RNNs to accomplish tasks where neural representations and dynamics have long temporal dependencies without gating mechanisms such as LSTMs or GRUs which currently lack experimental support and prohibit direct comparison between RNNs and biological neural circuits. We tackled this problem based on the idea of specialized skip-connections through time to support the emergence of task-relevant dynamics, and subsequently reinstitute biological plausibility by reverting to the original architecture. We show that this approach enables RNNs to successfully learn cognitive tasks that prove impractical if not impossible to learn using conventional methods. Over numerous tasks considered here, we achieve less training steps and shorter wall-clock times, particularly in tasks that require learning long-term dependencies via temporal integration over long timescales or maintaining a memory of past events in hidden-states. Our methods expand the range of experimental tasks that biologically plausible RNN models can learn, thereby supporting the development of theory for the emergent neural mechanisms of computations involving long-term dependencies",

To address this, we propose TPSR, a Transformer-based Planning strategy for Symbolic Regression that incorporates Monte Carlo Tree Search into the transformer decoding process.

One challenge with their implementation is that GNNs often take large-scale graphs as inputs, which imposes significant computational/storage costs in the training and testing phases. In particular, the message passing operations of a GNN require multiplication of the graph adjacency matrix $A \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times n}$ and the data matrix $X \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times d}$, and the $O(n^2 d)$ time complexity can be prohibitive for large $n$.

To study this question, we consider the setting of a regression task on a two-layer Linear Graph Convolutional Network (GCN).

    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "In this paper, we present Neural k-Opt (NeuOpt), a novel learning-to-search (L2S) solver for routing problems. It learns to perform flexible k-opt exchanges based on a tailored action factorization method and a customized recurrent dual-stream decoder. As a pioneering work to circumvent the pure feasibility masking scheme and enable the autonomous exploration of both feasible and infeasible regions, we then propose the Guided Infeasible Region Exploration (GIRE) scheme, which supplements the NeuOpt policy network with feasibility-related features and leverages reward shaping to steer reinforcement learning more effectively. Additionally, we equip NeuOpt with Dynamic Data Augmentation (D2A) for more diverse searches during inference. Extensive experiments on the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) and Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) demonstrate that our NeuOpt not only significantly outstrips existing (masking-based) L2S solvers, but also showcases superiority over the learning-to-construct (L2C) and learning-to-predict (L2P) solvers. Notably, we offer fresh perspectives on how neural solvers can handle VRP constraints. Our code is available: https://github.com/yining043/NeuOpt",

    "abstract": "We propose a family of recursive cutting-plane algorithms to solve feasibility problems with constrained memory, which can also be used for first-order convex optimization. Precisely, in order to find a point within a ball of radius $\\epsilon$ with a separation oracle in dimension $d$---or to minimize $1$-Lipschitz convex functions to accuracy $\\epsilon$ over the unit ball---our algorithms use $\\mathcal O(\\frac{d^2}{p}\\ln \\frac{1}{\\epsilon})$ bits of memory, and make $\\mathcal O((C\\frac{d}{p}\\ln \\frac{1}{\\epsilon})^p)$ oracle calls. The family is parametrized by $p\\in[d]$ and provides an oracle-complexity/memory trade-off in the sub-polynomial regime $\\ln\\frac{1}{\\epsilon}\\gg\\ln d$. While several works gave lower-bound trade-offs (impossibility results)---we explicit here their dependence with $\\ln\\frac{1}{\\epsilon}$, showing that these also hold in any sub-polynomial regime---to the best of our knowledge this is the first class of algorithms that provides a positive trade-off between gradient descent and cutting-plane methods in any regime with $\\epsilon\\leq 1/\\sqrt d$. The algorithms divide the $d$ variables into $p$ blocks and optimize over blocks sequentially, with approximate separation vectors constructed using a variant of Vaidya's method.

    "title": "Persuading Farsighted Receivers in MDPs: the Power of Honesty",
    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "Bayesian persuasion studies the problem faced by an informed sender who strategically discloses information to influence the behavior of an uninformed receiver. Recently, a growing attention has been devoted to settings where the sender and the receiver interact sequentially, in which the receiver's decision-making problem is usually modeled as a Markov decision process (MDP). However, the literature focuses on computing optimal information-revelation policies (a.k.a. signaling schemes) under the restrictive assumption that the receiver acts myopically, selecting actions to maximize the one-step utility and disregarding future rewards. This is justified by the fact that, when the receiver is farsighted and thus considers future rewards, finding an optimal Markovian signaling scheme is NP-hard. In this paper, we show that Markovian signaling schemes do not constitute the \"right\" class of policies. Indeed, differently from most of the MDPs settings, we show that Markovian signaling schemes are not optimal, and general history-dependent signaling schemes should be considered. Moreover, we also show that history-dependent signaling schemes circumvent the negative complexity results affecting Markovian signaling schemes. Formally, we design an algorithm that computes an optimal and $\\epsilon$-persuasive history-dependent signaling scheme in time polynomial in ${1}/{\\epsilon}$ and in the instance size. The crucial challenge is that general history-dependent signaling schemes cannot be represented in polynomial space. Nevertheless, we introduce a convenient subclass of history-dependent signaling schemes, called promise-form, which are as powerful as general history-dependent ones and efficiently representable. Intuitively, promise-form signaling schemes compactly encode histories in the form of honest promises on future receiver's rewards",

Traditional methods to analyze brain activity based on the Wiener-Granger causality principle quantify the overall information propagated by neural activity between simultaneously recorded brain regions, but do not reveal the information flow about specific features of interest (such as sensory stimuli). Here, we develop a new information theoretic measure termed Feature-specific Information Transfer (FIT), quantifying how much information about a specific feature flows between two regions. FIT merges the Wiener-Granger causality principle with information-content specificity. We first derive FIT and prove analytically its key properties. We then illustrate and test them with simulations of neural activity, demonstrating that FIT identifies, within the total information propagated between regions, the information that is transmitted about specific features. We then analyze three neural datasets obtained with different recording methods, magneto- and electro-encephalography, and spiking activity, to demonstrate the ability of FIT to uncover the content and direction of information flow between brain regions beyond what can be discerned with traditional analytical methods. FIT can improve our understanding of how brain regions communicate by uncovering previously unaddressed feature-specific information flow",

    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "Electroencephalography (EEG) is a prominent non-invasive neuroimaging technique providing insights into brain function. Unfortunately, EEG data exhibit a high degree of noise and variability across subjects hampering generalizable signal extraction. Therefore, a key aim in EEG analysis is to extract the underlying neural activation (content) as well as to account for the individual subject variability (style). We hypothesize that the ability to convert EEG signals between tasks and subjects requires the extraction of latent representations accounting for content and style. Inspired by recent advancements in voice conversion technologies, we propose a novel contrastive split-latent permutation autoencoder (CSLP-AE) framework that directly optimizes for EEG conversion. Importantly, the latent representations are guided using contrastive learning to promote the latent splits to explicitly represent subject (style) and task (content). We contrast CSLP-AE to conventional supervised, unsupervised (AE), and self-supervised (contrastive learning) training and find that the proposed approach provides favorable generalizable characterizations of subject and task. Importantly, the procedure also enables zero-shot conversion between unseen subjects. While the present work only considers conversion of EEG, the proposed CSLP-AE provides a general framework for signal conversion and extraction of content (task activation) and style (subject variability) components of general interest for the modeling and analysis of biological signals",

    "abstract": "Large language models have an exceptional capability to incorporate new information in a contextual manner. However, the full potential of such an approach is often restrained due to a limitation in the effective context length. One solution to this issue is to endow an attention layer with access to an additional context, which comprises of (key, value) pairs. Yet, as the number of documents increases, the proportion of relevant keys to irrelevant ones decreases, leading the model to focus more on the irrelevant keys. We identify a significant challenge, dubbed the distraction issue, where keys linked to different semantic values might overlap, making them hard to distinguish. To tackle this problem, we introduce the Focused Transformer (FoT), a technique that employs a training process inspired by contrastive learning. This novel approach enhances the structure of the (key, value) space, enabling an extension of the context length. Our method allows for fine-tuning pre-existing, large-scale models to lengthen their effective context. This is demonstrated by our fine-tuning of $3 B$ and $7 B$ OpenLLaMA checkpoints. The resulting models, which we name LongLLaMA, exhibit advancements in tasks requiring a long context. We further illustrate that our LongLLaMA models adeptly manage a $256 k$ context length for passkey retrieval",

    "abstract": "Despite the remarkable achievements of neural radiance fields (NeRF) in representing 3D scenes and generating novel view images, the aliasing issue, rendering 'jaggies' or 'blurry' images at varying camera distances, remains unresolved in most existing approaches. The recently proposed mip-NeRF has effectively addressed this challenge by introducing integrated positional encodings (IPE). However, it relies on MLP architecture to represent the radiance fields, missing out on the fast training speed offered by the latest grid-based methods. In this work, we present mip-Grid, a novel approach that integrates anti-aliasing techniques into grid-based representations for radiance fields, mitigating the aliasing artifacts while enjoying fast training time. Notably, the proposed method uses a single-scale shared grid representation and a single-sampling approach, which only introduces minimal additions to the model parameters and computational costs. To handle scale ambiguity, mip-Grid generates multiple grids by applying simple convolution operations over the shared grid and uses the scale-aware coordinate to retrieve the appropriate features from the generated multiple grids. To test the effectiveness, we incorporated the proposed approach into the two recent representative grid-based methods, TensoRF and K-Planes. The experimental results demonstrated that mip-Grid greatly improved the rendering performance of both methods and showed comparable performance to mip-NeRF on multi-scale datasets while achieving significantly faster training time",

    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "Federated Learning (FL) is a decentralized machine learning paradigm that enables collaborative model training across dispersed nodes without having to force individual nodes to share data. However, its broad adoption is hindered by the high communication costs of transmitting a large number of model parameters. This paper presents EvoFed, a novel approach that integrates Evolutionary Strategies (ES) with FL to address these challenges. EvoFed employs a concept of `fitness-based information sharing', deviating significantly from the conventional model-based FL. Rather than exchanging the actual updated model parameters, each node transmits a distance-based similarity measure between the locally updated model and each member of the noise-perturbed model population. Each node, as well as the server, generates an identical population set of perturbed models in a completely synchronized fashion using the same random seeds. With properly chosen noise variance and population size, perturbed models can be combined to closely reflect the actual model updated using the local dataset, allowing the transmitted similarity measures (or fitness values) to carry nearly the complete information about the model parameters. As the population size is typically much smaller than the number of model parameters, the savings in communication load is large. The server aggregates these fitness values and is able to update the global model. This global fitness vector is then disseminated back to the nodes, each of which applies the same update to be synchronized to the global model. Our analysis shows that EvoFed converges, and our experimental results validate that at the cost of increased local processing loads, EvoFed achieves performance comparable to FedAvg while reducing overall communication requirements drastically in various practical settings",

    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "We develop a versatile new methodology for multidimensional mechanism design that incorporates side information about agent types to generate high social welfare and high revenue simultaneously. Prominent sources of side information in practice include predictions from a machine-learning model trained on historical agent data, advice from domain experts, and even the mechanism designer's own gut instinct. In this paper we adopt a prior-free perspective that makes no assumptions on the correctness, accuracy, or source of the side information. First, we design a meta-mechanism that integrates input side information with an improvement of the classical VCG mechanism. The welfare, revenue, and incentive properties of our meta-mechanism are characterized by novel constructions we introduce based on the notion of a weakest competitor, which is an agent that has the smallest impact on welfare. We show that our meta-mechanism, when carefully instantiated, simultaneously achieves strong welfare and revenue guarantees parameterized by errors in the side information. When the side information is highly informative and accurate, our mechanism achieves welfare and revenue competitive with the total social surplus, and its performance decays continuously and gradually as the quality of the side information decreases. Finally, we apply our meta-mechanism to a setting where each agent's type is determined by a constant number of parameters. Specifically, agent types lie on constant-dimensional subspaces (of the potentially high-dimensional ambient type space) that are known to the mechanism designer. We use our meta-mechanism to obtain the first known welfare and revenue guarantees in this setting",

    "abstract": "The success of meta-learning on out-of-distribution (OOD) tasks in the wild has proved to be hit-and-miss. To safeguard the generalization capability of the meta-learned prior knowledge to OOD tasks, in particularly safety-critical applications, necessitates detection of an OOD task followed by adaptation of the task towards the prior. Nonetheless, the reliability of estimated uncertainty on OOD tasks by existing Bayesian meta-learning methods is restricted by incomplete coverage of the feature distribution shift and insufficient expressiveness of the meta-learned prior. Besides, they struggle to adapt an OOD task, running parallel to the line of cross-domain task adaptation solutions which are vulnerable to overfitting. To this end, we build a single coherent framework that supports both detection and adaptation of OOD tasks, while remaining compatible with off-the-shelf meta-learning backbones. The proposed Energy-Based Meta-Learning (EBML) framework learns to characterize any arbitrary meta-training task distribution with the composition of two expressive neural-network-based energy functions. We deploy the sum of the two energy functions, being proportional to the joint distribution of a task, as a reliable score for detecting OOD tasks; during meta-testing, we adapt the OOD task to in-distribution tasks by energy minimization.

However, a key challenge in adopting the latest machine learning methods is the representation of programming languages which has a direct impact on the ability of machine learning methods to reason about programs. The absence of numerical awareness, aggregate data structure information, and improper way of presenting variables in previous representation works have limited their performances. To overcome the limitations and challenges of current program representations, we propose a novel graph-based program representation called PERFOGRAPH. PERFOGRAPH can capture numerical information and the aggregate data structure by introducing new nodes and edges. Furthermore, we propose an adapted embedding method to incorporate numerical awareness. These enhancements make PERFOGRAPH a highly flexible and scalable representation that can effectively capture programs' intricate dependencies and semantics. Consequently, it serves as a powerful tool for various applications such as program analysis, performance optimization, and parallelism discovery. Our experimental results demonstrate that PERFOGRAPH outperforms existing representations and sets new state-of-the-art results by reducing the error rate by 7.4% (AMD dataset) and 10% (NVIDIA dataset) in the well-known Device Mapping challenge.

Several techniques such as weight regularization, experience rehearsal, and parameter isolation have been proposed to alleviate CF. Despite their relative success, these research directions have predominantly remained orthogonal and suffer from several shortcomings, while missing out on the advantages of competing strategies. On the contrary, the brain continually learns, accommodates, and transfers knowledge across tasks by simultaneously leveraging several neurophysiological processes, including neurogenesis, active forgetting, neuromodulation, metaplasticity, experience rehearsal, and context-dependent gating, rarely resulting in CF. Inspired by how the brain exploits multiple mechanisms concurrently, we propose TriRE, a novel CL paradigm that encompasses retaining the most prominent neurons for each task, revising and solidifying the extracted knowledge of current and past tasks, and actively promoting less active neurons for subsequent tasks through rewinding and relearning. Across CL settings, TriRE significantly reduces task interference and surpasses different CL approaches considered in isolation",

This raises the issue of how well we understand the training dynamics of multi-task and multi-domain networks. In this work, we first devise a large-scale unified analysis of multi-domain and multi-task learning to better understand the dynamics of scalarization across varied task/domain combinations and model sizes.

In contrast to conventional approaches, which primarily focus on the spatial domain exploration, we propose a paradigm shift toward the Fourier domain. This alternative perspective aims to enhance visual-textual matching, ultimately improving the agent's ability to understand and execute navigation tasks based on the given instructions. In this study, we first explore the significance of high-frequency information in VLN and provide evidence that it is instrumental in bolstering visual-textual matching processes. Building upon this insight, we further propose a sophisticated and versatile Frequency-enhanced Data Augmentation (FDA) technique to improve the VLN model's capability of capturing critical high-frequency information. Specifically, this approach requires the agent to navigate in environments where only a subset of high-frequency visual information corresponds with the provided textual instructions, ultimately fostering the agent's ability to selectively discern and capture pertinent high-frequency features according to the given instructions. Promising results on R2R, RxR, CVDN and REVERIE demonstrate that our FDA can be readily integrated with existing VLN approaches, improving performance without adding extra parameters, and keeping models simple and efficient.

To deal with the function variations and the unavailability of the true hypergradients in OBO, we propose a single-loop online bilevel optimizer with window averaging (SOBOW), which updates the outer-level decision based on a window average of the most recent hypergradient estimations stored in the memory. Compared to existing algorithms, SOBOW is computationally efficient and does not need to know previous functions. To handle the unique technical difficulties rooted in single-loop update and function variations for OBO, we develop a novel analytical technique that disentangles the complex couplings between decision variables, and carefully controls the hypergradient estimation error. We show that SOBOW can achieve a sublinear bilevel local regret under mild conditions. Extensive experiments across multiple domains corroborate the effectiveness of SOBOW",

In practice, local search algorithms for clustering problems mainly adapt the single-swap strategy, which enables them to handle large-scale datasets and achieve linear running time in the data size. However, compared with multi-swap local search algorithms, there is a considerable gap on the approximation ratios of the single-swap local search algorithms. Although the current multi-swap local search algorithms provide small constant approximation, the proposed algorithms tend to have large polynomial running time, which cannot be used to handle large-scale datasets. In this paper, we propose a multi-swap local search algorithm for the $k$-means problem with linear running time in the data size. Given a swap size $t$, our proposed algorithm can achieve a $(50(1+\\frac{1}{t})+\\epsilon)$-approximation, which improves the current best result 509 (ICML 2019) with linear running time in the data size. Our proposed method, compared with previous multi-swap local search algorithms, is the first one to achieve linear running time in the data size. To obtain a more practical algorithm for the problem with better clustering quality and running time, we propose a sampling-based method which accelerates the process of clustering cost update during swaps. Besides, a recombination mechanism is proposed to find potentially better solutions.

However, (1) inconsistent findings regarding the validation of this hypothesis reflect in a limited understanding of HFC, and (2) solutions inspired by the hypothesis tend to involve a robustness-accuracy trade-off and leaning towards suppressing the model's learning on HFC. In this paper, inspired by the long-tailed characteristic observed in frequency spectrum, we first formally define the HFC from long-tailed perspective and then revisit the relationship between HFC and model robustness. In the frequency long-tailed scenario, experimental results on common datasets and various network structures consistently indicate that models in standard training exhibit high sensitivity to HFC. We investigate the reason of the sensitivity, which reflects in model's under-fitting behavior on HFC. Furthermore, the cause of the model's under-fitting behavior is attributed to the limited information content in HFC. Based on these findings, we propose a Balance Spectrum Sampling (BaSS) strategy, which effectively counteracts the long-tailed effect and enhances the model's learning on HFC. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves a substantially better robustness-accuracy trade-off when combined with existing defense methods, while also indicating the potential of encouraging HFC learning in improving model performance",

In this paper, we first propose a novel Max-Ent framework for policy evaluation in a distributional RL setting, named *Distributional Maximum Entropy Policy Evaluation* (D-Max-Ent PE). We derive a generalization-error bound that depends on the complexity of the representation employed, showing that this framework can explicitly take into account the features used to represent the state space while evaluating a policy. Then, we exploit these favorable properties to drive the representation learning of the state space in a Structural Risk Minimization fashion. We employ state-aggregation functions as feature functions and we specialize the D-Max-Ent approach into an algorithm, named *D-Max-Ent Progressive Factorization*, which constructs a progressively finer-grained representation of the state space by balancing the trade-off between preserving information (bias) and reducing the effective number of states, i.e., the complexity of the representation space (variance). Finally, we report the results of some illustrative numerical simulations, showing that the proposed algorithm matches the expected theoretical behavior and highlighting the relationship between aggregations and sample regimes",

Existing methods for addressing this issue either control policy to exclude the OOD action or make the $Q$ function pessimistic. However, these methods can be overly conservative or fail to identify OOD areas accurately. To overcome this problem, we propose a Constrained Policy optimization with Explicit Behavior density (CPED) method that utilizes a flow-GAN model to explicitly estimate the density of behavior policy. By estimating the explicit density, CPED can accurately identify the safe region and enable exploration within the region, resulting in less conservative learning policies. We further provide theoretical results for both the flow-GAN estimator and performance guarantee for CPED by showing that CPED can find the optimal $Q$-function value.

To gain further theoretical insight into non-contrastive SSL, we analytically study learning dynamics in conjunction with Euclidean and cosine similarity in the eigenspace of closed-form linear predictor networks. We show that both avoid collapse through implicit variance regularization albeit through different dynamical mechanisms. Moreover, we find that the eigenvalues act as effective learning rate multipliers and propose a family of isotropic loss functions (IsoLoss) that equalize convergence rates across eigenmodes. Empirically, IsoLoss speeds up the initial learning dynamics and increases robustness, thereby allowing us to dispense with the EMA target network typically used with non-contrastive methods. Our analysis sheds light on the variance regularization mechanisms of non-contrastive SSL and lays the theoretical grounds for crafting novel loss functions that shape the learning dynamics of the predictor's spectrum",

While ABC is efficient on low-dimensional problems, on higher-dimensional tasks, it is generally outperformed by SNPE, which leverages function approximation. In this paper, we propose Pseudo-Likelihood Inference (PLI), a new method that brings neural approximation into ABC, making it competitive on challenging Bayesian system identification tasks. By utilizing integral probability metrics, we introduce a smooth likelihood kernel with an adaptive bandwidth that is updated based on information-theoretic trust regions. Thanks to this formulation, our method (i) allows for optimizing neural posteriors via gradient descent, (ii) does not rely on summary statistics, and (iii) enables multiple observations as input. In comparison to SNPE, it leads to improved performance when more data is available.

Its *star-shaped diffusion process* allows us to bypass the need to define the transition probabilities or compute posteriors. We establish duality between star-shaped and specific Markovian diffusions for the exponential family of distributions and derive efficient algorithms for training and sampling from SS-DDPMs. In the case of Gaussian distributions, SS-DDPM is equivalent to DDPM. However, SS-DDPMs provide a simple recipe for designing diffusion models with distributions such as Beta, von Mises–Fisher, Dirichlet, Wishart and others, which can be especially useful when data lies on a constrained manifold. We evaluate the model in different settings and find it competitive even on image data, where Beta SS-DDPM achieves results comparable to a Gaussian DDPM.

Deep learning-based methods have significantly improved image restoration performance, however, they have limited generalization ability to different degradation types and levels. This restricts their real-world application since it requires training individual models for each specific degradation and knowing the input degradation type to apply the relevant model. We present a prompt-based learning approach, PromptIR, for All-In-One image restoration that can effectively restore images from various types and levels of degradation. In particular, our method uses prompts to encode degradation-specific information, which is then used to dynamically guide the restoration network. This allows our method to generalize to different degradation types and levels, while still achieving state-of-the-art results on image denoising, deraining, and dehazing. Overall, PromptIR offers a generic and efficient plugin module with few lightweight prompts that can be used to restore images of various types and levels of degradation with no prior information on the corruptions present in the image.

Instead, we consider the case of (approximately) few root causes and also introduce noise in the measurement of the data. Intuitively, this means that the DAG data is produced by few data generating events whose effect percolates through the DAG. We prove identifiability in this new setting and show that the true DAG is the global minimizer of the $L^0$-norm of the vector of root causes.

Causal Representation Learning (CRL) aims instead to infer causally related (thus often statistically _dependent_) latent variables, together with the unknown graph encoding their causal relationships.

CauCA can be viewed as a generalization of ICA, modelling the causal dependence among the latent components, and as a special case of CRL. In contrast to CRL, it presupposes knowledge of the causal graph, focusing solely on learning the unmixing function and the causal mechanisms. Any impossibility results regarding the recovery of the ground truth in CauCA also apply for CRL, while possibility results may serve as a stepping stone for extensions to CRL. We characterize CauCA identifiability from multiple datasets generated through different types of interventions on the latent causal variables. As a corollary, this interventional perspective also leads to new identifiability results for nonlinear ICA—a special case of CauCA with an empty graph—requiring strictly fewer datasets than previous results. We introduce a likelihood-based approach using normalizing flows to estimate both the unmixing function and the causal mechanisms, and demonstrate its effectiveness through extensive synthetic experiments in the CauCA and ICA setting",

Specifically, we prove a privacy bound for the KL divergence between model distributions on worst-case neighboring datasets, and explore its dependence on the initialization, width, and depth of fully connected neural networks. We find that this KL privacy bound is largely determined by the expected squared gradient norm relative to model parameters during training. Notably, for the special setting of linearized network, our analysis indicates that the squared gradient norm (and therefore the escalation of privacy loss) is tied directly to the per-layer variance of the initialization distribution. By using this analysis, we demonstrate that privacy bound improves with increasing depth under certain initializations (LeCun and Xavier), while degrades with increasing depth under other initializations (He and NTK). Our work reveals a complex interplay between privacy and depth that depends on the chosen initialization distribution. We further prove excess empirical risk bounds under a fixed KL privacy budget, and show that the interplay between privacy utility trade-off and depth is similarly affected by the initialization",

Our result implies that when the dimension is large, there is hardly a sampling method can have a faster convergence rate than the uniform sampling method. To achieve a better statistical performance, we propose a new sketching method based on data averaging. The proposed method reduces the original data to a few averaged observations. These averaged observations still satisfy the linear model and are used to estimate the regression coefficients. The asymptotic behavior of the proposed estimation procedure is studied.

We show that our modified architecture runs asymptotically faster than Transformers in sequence length and performs better than RNN's on a simple memory-based task. We evaluate our modified architecture on a set of partially-observable environments and find that, in practice, our model outperforms RNN's while also running over five times faster. Then, by leveraging the model's ability to handle long-range sequences, we achieve strong performance on a challenging meta-learning task in which the agent is given a randomly-sampled continuous control environment, combined with a randomly-sampled linear projection of the environment's observations and actions. Furthermore, we show the resulting model can adapt to out-of-distribution held-out tasks. Overall, the results presented in this paper show that structured state space models are fast and performant for in-context reinforcement learning tasks.

    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "Deep learning models are emerging to summarize source code to comment, facilitating tasks of code documentation and program comprehension. Scaled-up large language models trained on large open corpus have achieved good performance in such tasks. However, in practice, the subject code in one certain project can be specific, which may not align with the overall training corpus. Some code samples from other projects may be contradictory and introduce inconsistencies when the models try to fit all the samples. In this work, we introduce a novel approach, Adacom, to improve the performance of comment generators by on-the-fly model adaptation. This research is motivated by the observation that deep comment generators often need to strike a balance as they need to fit all the training samples. Specifically, for one certain target code $c$, some training samples $S_p$ could have made more contributions while other samples $S_o$ could have counter effects. However, the traditional fine-tuned models need to fit both $S_p$ and $S_o$ from a global perspective, leading to compromised performance for one certain target code $c$. In this context, we design Adacom to (1) detect whether the model might have a compromised performance on a target code $c$ and (2) retrieve a few helpful training samples $S_p$ that have contradictory samples in the training dataset and, (3) adapt the model on the fly by re-training the $S_p$ to strengthen the helpful samples and unlearn the harmful samples. Our extensive experiments on 7 comment generators and 4 public datasets show that (1) can significantly boost the performance of comment generation (BLEU4 score by on average 14.9\\%, METEOR by 12.2\\%, and ROUGE-L by 7.4\\%), (2) the adaptation on one code sample is cost-effective and acceptable as an on-the-fly solution, and (3) can adapt well on out-of-distribution code samples",

    "abstract": "We propose a general class of sample based explanations of machine learning models, which we term generalized representers. To measure the effect of a training sample on a model's test prediction, generalized representers use two components: a global sample importance that quantifies the importance of the training point to the model and is invariant to test samples, and a local sample importance that measures similarity between the training sample and the test point with a kernel. A key contribution of the paper is to show that generalized representers are the only class of sample based explanations satisfying a natural set of axiomatic properties. We discuss approaches to extract global importances given a kernel, and also natural choices of kernels given modern non-linear models. As we show, many popular existing sample based explanations could be cast as generalized representers with particular choices of kernels and approaches to extract global importances. Additionally, we conduct empirical comparisons of different generalized representers on two image classification datasets",

However, current methods for evaluating such models remain incomplete: standard likelihood-based metrics do not always apply and rarely correlate with perceptual fidelity, while sample-based metrics, such as FID, are insensitive to overfitting, i.e., inability to generalize beyond the training set. To address these limitations, we propose a new metric called the Feature Likelihood Score (FLS), a parametric sample-based score that uses density estimation to provide a comprehensive trichotomic evaluation accounting for novelty (i.e., different from the training samples), fidelity, and diversity of generated samples. We empirically demonstrate the ability of FLS to identify specific overfitting problem cases, where previously proposed metrics fail. We also extensively evaluate FLS on various image datasets and model classes, demonstrating its ability to match intuitions of previous metrics like FID while offering a more comprehensive evaluation of generative models",

In this work, we instead propose replacing a baseline network's existing activations with a novel ensemble function with trainable parameters. The proposed MetaSin activation can be trained reliably without requiring intricate initialization schemes, and results in consistently lower test loss compared to alternatives. We demonstrate our method in the areas of Monte-Carlo denoising and image resampling where we set new state-of-the-art through a knowledge distillation based training procedure.

    "abstract": "Learning to accurately represent environmental uncertainty is crucial for adaptive and optimal behaviors in various cognitive tasks. However, it remains unclear how the human brain, constrained by finite cognitive resources, constructs an internal model from an infinite space of probability distributions. In this study, we explore how these learned distributions deviate from the ground truth, resulting in observable inconsistency in a novel structured density estimation task. During each trial, human participants were asked to form and report the latent probability distribution functions underlying sequentially presented independent observations. As the number of observations increased, the reported predictive density became closer to the ground truth. Nevertheless, we observed an intriguing inconsistency in human structure estimation, specifically a large error in the number of reported clusters. Such inconsistency is invariant to the scale of the distribution and persists across stimulus modalities. We modeled uncertainty learning as approximate Bayesian inference in a nonparametric mixture prior of distributions. Human reports were best explained under resource rationality embodied in a decaying tendency towards model expansion. Our study offers insights into human cognitive processes under uncertainty and lays the groundwork for further exploration of resource-rational representations in the brain under more complex tasks",

However, the large model size poses challenges for practical deployment. To solve this problem, Quantization-Aware Training (QAT) has become increasingly popular. However, current QAT methods for generative models have resulted in a noticeable loss of accuracy. To counteract this issue, we propose a novel knowledge distillation method specifically designed for GLMs. Our method, called token-scaled logit distillation, prevents overfitting and provides superior learning from the teacher model and ground truth.

    "abstract": "Training data attribution (TDA) techniques find influential training data for the model's prediction on the test data of interest. They approximate the impact of down- or up-weighting a particular training sample. While conceptually useful, they are hardly applicable to deep models in practice, particularly because of their sensitivity to different model initialisation. In this paper, we introduce a Bayesian perspective on the TDA task, where the learned model is treated as a Bayesian posterior and the TDA estimates as random variables. From this novel viewpoint, we observe that the influence of an individual training sample is often overshadowed by the noise stemming from model initialisation and SGD batch composition. Based on this observation, we argue that TDA can only be reliably used for explaining deep model predictions that are consistently influenced by certain training data, independent of other noise factors. Our experiments demonstrate the rarity of such noise-independent training-test data pairs but confirm their existence. We recommend that future researchers and practitioners trust TDA estimates only in such cases.

Inspired by this, we train neural models to generate a spectrum of discrete representations, and control the complexity of the representations (roughly, how many bits are allocated for encoding inputs) by tuning the entropy of the distribution over representations. In finetuning experiments, using only a small number of labeled examples for a new task, we show that (1) tuning the representation to a task-appropriate complexity level supports the greatest finetuning performance, and (2) in a human-participant study, users were able to identify the appropriate complexity level for a downstream task via visualizations of discrete representations.

But when we are primarily interested in the quality of predictive simulations, or when the model cannot exactly reproduce the observed data (i.e., is misspecified), targeting the Bayesian posterior may be overly restrictive. Generalized Bayesian Inference (GBI) aims to robustify inference for (misspecified) simulator models, replacing the likelihood-function with a cost function that evaluates the goodness of parameters relative to data. However, GBI methods generally require running multiple simulations to estimate the cost function at each parameter value during inference, making the approach computationally infeasible for even moderately complex simulators. Here, we propose amortized cost estimation (ACE) for GBI to address this challenge: We train a neural network to approximate the cost function, which we define as the expected distance between simulations produced by a parameter and observed data. The trained network can then be used with MCMC to infer GBI posteriors for any observation without running additional simulations. We show that, on several benchmark tasks, ACE accurately predicts cost and provides predictive simulations that are closer to synthetic observations than other SBI methods, especially for misspecified simulators. Finally, we apply ACE to infer parameters of the Hodgkin-Huxley model given real intracellular recordings from the Allen Cell Types Database. ACE identifies better data-matching parameters while being an order of magnitude more simulation-efficient than a standard SBI method. In summary, ACE combines the strengths of SBI methods and GBI to perform robust and simulation-amortized inference for scientific simulators",

    "abstract": "The transferability of adversarial perturbations provides an effective shortcut for black-box attacks. Targeted perturbations have greater practicality but are more difficult to transfer between models. In this paper, we experimentally and theoretically demonstrated that neural networks trained on the same dataset have more consistent performance in High-Sample-Density-Regions (HSDR) of each class instead of low sample density regions. Therefore, in the target setting, adding perturbations towards HSDR of the target class is more effective in improving transferability. However, density estimation is challenging in high-dimensional scenarios. Further theoretical and experimental verification demonstrates that easy samples with low loss are more likely to be located in HSDR. Perturbations towards such easy samples in the target class can avoid density estimation for HSDR location. Based on the above facts, we verified that adding perturbations to easy samples in the target class improves targeted adversarial transferability of existing attack methods. A generative targeted attack strategy named Easy Sample Matching Attack (ESMA) is proposed, which has a higher success rate for targeted attacks and outperforms the SOTA generative method. Moreover, ESMA requires only $5\\%$ of the storage space and much less computation time comparing to the current SOTA, as ESMA attacks all classes with only one model instead of seperate models for each class.

With both theoretical and empirical evidence, we show that popular tuning approaches have their equivalent counterparts under our unbinding formulation, and hence can be integrated into our framework effortlessly.

We further propose a memory-efficient variant of Res-Tuning, where the bypass i.e., formed by a sequence of tuners) is effectively detached from the main branch, such that the gradients are back-propagated only to the tuners but not to the backbone. Such a detachment also allows one-time backbone forward for multi-task inference.

Furthermore, neither method satisfies the requirements of real-world face verification applications, which expect a unified threshold separating positive from negative facial pairs. In this paper, we propose a unified threshold integrated sample-to-sample based loss (USS loss), which features an explicit unified threshold for distinguishing positive from negative pairs. Inspired by our USS loss, we also derive the sample-to-sample based softmax and BCE losses, and discuss their relationship. Extensive evaluation on multiple benchmark datasets, including MFR, IJB-C, LFW, CFP-FP, AgeDB, and MegaFace, demonstrates that the proposed USS loss is highly efficient and can work seamlessly with sample-to-class-based losses. The embedded loss (USS and sample-to-class Softmax loss) overcomes the pitfalls of previous approaches and the trained facial model UniTSFace exhibits exceptional performance, outperforming state-of-the-art methods, such as CosFace, ArcFace, VPL, AnchorFace, and UNPG.

    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "Information diffusion problems, such as the spread of epidemics or rumors, are widespread in society. The inverse problems of graph diffusion, which involve locating the sources and identifying the paths of diffusion based on currently observed diffusion graphs, are crucial to controlling the spread of information. The problem of localizing the source of diffusion is highly ill-posed, presenting a major obstacle in accurately assessing the uncertainty involved. Besides, while comprehending how information diffuses through a graph is crucial, there is a scarcity of research on reconstructing the paths of information propagation. To tackle these challenges, we propose a probabilistic model called DDMSL (Discrete Diffusion Model for Source Localization). Our approach is based on the natural diffusion process of information propagation over complex networks, which can be formulated using a message-passing function. First, we model the forward diffusion of information using Markov chains. Then, we design a reversible residual network to construct a denoising-diffusion model in discrete space for both source localization and reconstruction of information diffusion paths. We provide rigorous theoretical guarantees for DDMSL and demonstrate its effectiveness through extensive experiments on five real-world datasets",

In 2020, Monemizadeh and Lattanzi, Mitrovic, Norouzi-Fard, Tarnawski, and Zadimoghaddam initiated developing dynamic algorithms for the monotone submodular maximization problem under the cardinality constraint $k$. In 2022, Chen and Peng studied the complexity of this problem and raised an important open question: \"\\emph{Can we extend [fully dynamic] results (algorithm or hardness) to non-monotone submodular maximization?}\". We affirmatively answer their question by demonstrating a reduction from maximizing a non-monotone submodular function under the cardinality constraint $k$ to maximizing a monotone submodular function under the same constraint. Through this reduction, we obtain the first dynamic algorithms to solve the non-monotone submodular maximization problem under the cardinality constraint $k$.

CoLA can accelerate many algebraic operations, while making it easy to prototype matrix structures and algorithms, providing an appealing drop-in tool for virtually any computational effort that requires linear algebra.

The importance of the topic is reflected in the variety of paradigms and architectures that have been investigated recently. Yet the differences in performance seem often minor and are barely understood to date. In this paper, we study SSL based on persistent homology (PH), a mathematical tool for modeling topological features of data that persist across multiple scales. It has several unique features which particularly suit SSL, naturally offering: different views of the data, stability in terms of distance preservation, and the opportunity to flexibly incorporate domain knowledge. We (1) investigate an autoencoder, which shows the general representational power of PH, and (2) propose a contrastive loss that complements existing approaches. We rigorously evaluate our approach for molecular property prediction and demonstrate its particular features in improving the embedding space: after SSL, the representations are better and offer considerably more predictive power than the baselines over different probing tasks; our loss increases baseline performance, sometimes largely; and we often obtain substantial improvements over very small datasets, a common scenario in practice",

Existing procedures seek configurations that minimize expected runtime. However, very recent theoretical work argues that expected runtime minimization fails to capture algorithm designers' preferences. Here we show that the utilitarian objective also confers significant algorithmic benefits. Intuitively, this is because mean runtime is dominated by extremely long runs even when they are incredibly rare; indeed, even when an algorithm never gives rise to such long runs, configuration procedures that provably minimize mean runtime must perform a huge number of experiments to demonstrate this fact. In contrast, utility is bounded and monotonically decreasing in runtime, allowing for meaningful empirical bounds on a configuration's performance. This paper builds on this idea to describe effective and theoretically sound configuration procedures. We prove upper bounds on the runtime of these procedures that are similar to theoretical lower bounds, while also demonstrating their performance empirically",

Using scaled and shifted beta distributions, beta diffusion utilizes multiplicative transitions over time to create both forward and reverse diffusion processes, maintaining beta distributions in both the forward marginals and the reverse conditionals, given the data at any point in time. Unlike traditional diffusion-based generative models relying on additive Gaussian noise and reweighted evidence lower bounds (ELBOs), beta diffusion is multiplicative and optimized with KL-divergence upper bounds (KLUBs) derived from the convexity of the KL divergence. We demonstrate that the proposed KLUBs are more effective for optimizing beta diffusion compared to negative ELBOs, which can also be derived as the KLUBs of the same KL divergence with its two arguments swapped. The loss function of beta diffusion, expressed in terms of Bregman divergence, further supports the efficacy of KLUBs for optimization. Experimental results on both synthetic data and natural images demonstrate the unique capabilities of beta diffusion in generative modeling of range-bounded data and validate the effectiveness of KLUBs in optimizing diffusion models, thereby making them valuable additions to the family of diffusion-based generative models and the optimization techniques used to train them",

    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "Intelligent systems possess a crucial characteristic of breaking complicated problems into smaller reusable components or parts and adjusting to new tasks using these part representations. However, current part-learners encounter difficulties in dealing with incidental correlations resulting from the limited observations of objects that may appear only in specific arrangements or with specific backgrounds. These incidental correlations may have a detrimental impact on the generalization and interpretability of learned part representations. This study asserts that part-based representations could be more interpretable and generalize better with limited data, employing two innovative regularization methods. The first regularization separates foreground and background information's generative process via a unique mixture-of-parts formulation. Structural constraints are imposed on the parts using a weakly-supervised loss, guaranteeing that the mixture-of-parts for foreground and background entails soft, object-agnostic masks. The second regularization assumes the form of a distillation loss, ensuring the invariance of the learned parts to the incidental background correlations. Furthermore, we incorporate sparse and orthogonal constraints to facilitate learning high-quality part representations. By reducing the impact of incidental background correlations on the learned parts, we exhibit state-of-the-art (SoTA) performance on few-shot learning tasks on benchmark datasets, including MiniImagenet, TieredImageNet, and FC100. We also demonstrate that the part-based representations acquired through our approach generalize better than existing techniques, even under domain shifts of the background and common data corruption on the ImageNet-9 dataset",

    "title": "Canonical normalizing flows for manifold learning",
    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "Manifold learning flows are a class of generative modelling techniques that assume a low-dimensional manifold description of the data. The embedding of such a manifold into the high-dimensional space of the data is achieved via learnable invertible transformations. Therefore, once the manifold is properly aligned via a reconstruction loss, the probability density is tractable on the manifold and maximum likelihood can be used to optimize the network parameters. Naturally, the lower-dimensional representation of the data requires an injective-mapping. Recent approaches were able to enforce that the density aligns with the modelled manifold, while efficiently calculating the density volume-change term when embedding to the higher-dimensional space. However, unless the injective-mapping is analytically predefined, the learned manifold is not necessarily an \\emph{efficient representation} of the data. Namely, the latent dimensions of such models frequently learn an entangled intrinsic basis, with degenerate information being stored in each dimension. Alternatively, if a locally orthogonal and/or sparse basis is to be learned, here coined canonical intrinsic basis, it can serve in learning a more compact latent space representation. Toward this end, we propose a canonical manifold learning flow method, where a novel optimization objective enforces the transformation matrix to have few prominent and non-degenerate basis functions. We demonstrate that by minimizing the off-diagonal manifold metric elements $\\ell_1$-norm, we can achieve such a basis, which is simultaneously sparse and/or orthogonal. Canonical manifold flow yields a more efficient use of the latent space, automatically generating fewer prominent and distinct dimensions to represent data, and consequently a better approximation of target distributions than other manifold flow methods in most experiments we conducted, resulting in lower FID scores",

    "abstract": "In Reinforcement Learning (RL), enhancing sample efficiency is crucial, particularly in scenarios when data acquisition is costly and risky. In principle, off-policy RL algorithms can improve sample efficiency by allowing multiple updates per environment interaction. However, these multiple updates often lead the model to overfit to earlier interactions, which is referred to as the loss of plasticity. Our study investigates the underlying causes of this phenomenon by dividing plasticity into two aspects. Input plasticity, which denotes the model's adaptability to changing input data, and label plasticity, which denotes the model's adaptability to evolving input-output relationships. Synthetic experiments on the CIFAR-10 dataset reveal that finding smoother minima of loss landscape enhances input plasticity, whereas refined gradient propagation improves label plasticity. Leveraging these findings, we introduce the **PLASTIC** algorithm, which harmoniously combines techniques to address both concerns. With minimal architectural modifications, PLASTIC achieves competitive performance on benchmarks including Atari-100k and Deepmind Control Suite. This result emphasizes the importance of preserving the model's plasticity to elevate the sample efficiency in RL. The code is available at https://github.com/dojeon-ai/plastic",

While deep neural networks in principle can provide this flexibility and learn heteroscedastic aleatoric uncertainties through non-linear functions, recent works highlight that maximizing the log likelihood objective parameterized by mean and variance can lead to compromised mean fits since the gradient are scaled by the predictive variance, and propose adjustments in line with this premise. We instead propose to use the natural parametrization of the Gaussian, which has been shown to be more stable for heteroscedastic regression based on non-linear feature maps and Gaussian processes. Further, we emphasize the significance of principled regularization of the network parameters and prediction. We therefore propose an efficient Laplace approximation for heteroscedastic neural networks that allows automatic regularization through empirical Bayes and provides epistemic uncertainties, both of which improve generalization.

The amount of publicly available single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) data is already surpassing 50M records for humans with each record measuring 20,000 genes. This highlights the need for unsupervised representation learning to fully ingest these data, yet classical transformer architectures are prohibitive to train on such data in terms of both computation and memory.

    "title": "Action Inference by Maximising Evidence: Zero-Shot Imitation from Observation with World Models",
    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "Unlike most reinforcement learning agents which require an unrealistic amount of environment interactions to learn a new behaviour, humans excel at learning quickly by merely observing and imitating others. This ability highly depends on the fact that humans have a model of their own embodiment that allows them to infer the most likely actions that led to the observed behaviour. In this paper, we propose Action Inference by Maximising Evidence (AIME) to replicate this behaviour using world models. AIME consists of two distinct phases. In the first phase, the agent learns a world model from its past experience to understand its own body by maximising the ELBO. While in the second phase, the agent is given some observation-only demonstrations of an expert performing a novel task and tries to imitate the expert's behaviour. AIME achieves this by defining a policy as an inference model and maximising the evidence of the demonstration under the policy and world model. Our method is \"zero-shot\" in the sense that it does not require further training for the world model or online interactions with the environment after given the demonstration. We empirically validate the zero-shot imitation performance of our method on the Walker and Cheetah embodiment of the DeepMind Control Suite and find it outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines.

    "title": "Risk-Averse Active Sensing for Timely Outcome Prediction under Cost Pressure",
    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "Timely outcome prediction is essential in healthcare to enable early detection and intervention of adverse events. However, in longitudinal follow-ups to patients' health status, cost-efficient acquisition of patient covariates is usually necessary due to the significant expense involved in screening and lab tests. To balance the timely and accurate outcome predictions with acquisition costs, an effective active sensing strategy is crucial. In this paper, we propose a novel risk-averse active sensing approach RAS that addresses the composite decision problem of when to conduct the acquisition and which measurements to make. Our approach decomposes the policy into two sub-policies: acquisition scheduler and feature selector, respectively. Moreover, we introduce a novel risk-aversion training strategy to focus on the underrepresented subgroup of high-risk patients for whom timely and accurate prediction of disease progression is of greater value. Our method outperforms baseline active sensing approaches in experiments with both synthetic and real-world datasets, and we illustrate the significance of our policy decomposition and the necessity of a risk-averse sensing policy through case studies",

    "abstract": "Accurate interpolation algorithms are highly desired in various theoretical and engineering scenarios. Unlike the traditional numerical algorithms that have exact zero-residual constraints on observed points, the neural network-based interpolation methods exhibit non-zero residuals at these points. These residuals, which provide observations of an underlying residual function, can guide predicting interpolation functions, but have not been exploited by the existing approaches. To fill this gap, we propose Hierarchical INTerpolation Network (HINT), which utilizes the residuals on observed points to guide target function estimation in a hierarchical fashion. HINT consists of several sequentially arranged lightweight interpolation blocks. The first interpolation block estimates the main component of the target function, while subsequent blocks predict the residual components using observed points residuals of the preceding blocks. The main component and residual components are accumulated to form the final interpolation results. Furthermore, under the assumption that finer residual prediction requires a more focused attention range on observed points, we utilize hierarchical local constraints in correlation modeling between observed and target points. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HINT outperforms existing interpolation algorithms significantly in terms of interpolation accuracy across a wide variety of datasets, which underscores its potential for practical scenarios",

In this work, we propose a novel RL algorithm called HYbrid Policy Optimization (HYPO), which uses a small number of imperfect demonstrations to accelerate an agent's online learning process. The key idea is to train an offline guider policy using imitation learning in order to instruct an online agent policy to explore efficiently. Through mutual update of the guider policy and the agent policy, the agent can leverage suboptimal demonstrations for efficient exploration while avoiding the conservative policy caused by imperfect demonstrations.

By taking a distributional view of these returns, we map the landscape, characterizing failure-prone regions of policy space and revealing a hidden dimension of policy quality. We show that the landscape exhibits surprising structure by finding simple paths in parameter space which improve the stability of a policy.

    "abstract": "We study causal representation learning, the task of inferring latent causal variables and their causal relations from high-dimensional functions (\"mixtures\") of the variables. Prior work relies on weak supervision, in the form of counterfactual pre- and post-intervention views or temporal structure; places restrictive assumptions, such as linearity, on the mixing function or latent causal model; or requires partial knowledge of the generative process, such as the causal graph or intervention targets. We instead consider the general setting in which both the causal model and the mixing function are nonparametric. The learning signal takes the form of multiple datasets, or environments, arising from unknown interventions in the underlying causal model. Our goal is to identify both the ground truth latents and their causal graph up to a set of ambiguities which we show to be irresolvable from interventional data. We study the fundamental setting of two causal variables and prove that the observational distribution and one perfect intervention per node suffice for identifiability, subject to a genericity condition. This condition rules out spurious solutions that involve fine-tuning of the intervened and observational distributions, mirroring similar conditions for nonlinear cause-effect inference. For an arbitrary number of variables, we show that at least one pair of distinct perfect interventional domains per node guarantees identifiability. Further, we demonstrate that the strengths of causal influences among the latent variables are preserved by all equivalent solutions, rendering the inferred representation appropriate for drawing causal conclusions from new data. Our study provides the first identifiability results for the general nonparametric setting with unknown interventions, and elucidates what is possible and impossible for causal representation learning without more direct supervision",

Therefore, most agents employ memory mechanisms to approximate the state of the environment. Recently, there have been impressive success stories in mastering partially observable environments, mostly in the realm of computer games like Dota 2, StarCraft II, or MineCraft. However, existing methods lack interpretability in the sense that it is not comprehensible for humans what the agent stores in its memory. In this regard, we propose a novel memory mechanism that represents past events in human language. Our method uses CLIP to associate visual inputs with language tokens. Then we feed these tokens to a pretrained language model that serves the agent as memory and provides it with a coherent and human-readable representation of the past. We train our memory mechanism on a set of partially observable environments and find that it excels on tasks that require a memory component, while mostly attaining performance on-par with strong baselines on tasks that do not. On a challenging continuous recognition task, where memorizing the past is crucial, our memory mechanism converges two orders of magnitude faster than prior methods. Since our memory mechanism is human-readable, we can peek at an agent's memory and check whether crucial pieces of information have been stored. This significantly enhances troubleshooting and paves the way toward more interpretable agents",

    "abstract": "The breakthrough performance of large language models (LLMs) comes with major computational footprints and high deployment costs. In this paper, we progress towards resolving this problem by proposing a novel structured compression approach for LLMs, called ZipLM. ZipLM achieves state-of-the-art accuracy-vs-speedup, while matching a set of desired target runtime speedups in any given inference environment. Specifically, given a model, a dataset, an inference environment, as well as a set of speedup targets, ZipLM iteratively identifies and removes components with the worst loss-runtime trade-off. Unlike prior methods that specialize in either the *post-training/one-shot* or the *gradual compression* setting, and only for specific families of models such as BERT (*encoder*) or GPT (*decoder*), ZipLM produces state-of-the-art compressed models across all these settings. Furthermore, ZipLM achieves superior results for a fraction of the computational cost relative to prior distillation and pruning techniques, making it a cost-effective approach for generating an entire family of smaller, faster, and highly accurate models, guaranteed to meet the desired inference specifications. In particular, ZipLM outperforms all prior BERT-base distillation and pruning techniques, such as CoFi, MiniLM, and TinyBERT. Moreover, it matches the performance of the heavily optimized MobileBERT model, obtained via extensive architecture search, by simply pruning the baseline BERT-large model. When compressing GPT2, ZipLM outperforms DistilGPT2 while being 60\\% smaller and 30\\% faster. Our code is available at: https://github.com/IST-DASLab/ZipLM",

We analytically show that a model trained with such self-supervised training is as good as the same model trained in a supervised fashion, but self-supervised training requires more examples than supervised training. We then study self-supervised denoising and accelerated MRI empirically and characterize the cost of self-supervised training in terms of the number of additional samples required, and find that the performance gap between self-supervised and supervised training vanishes as a function of the training examples, at a problem-dependent rate, as predicted by our theory",

However, they are still struggling to achieve high learning efficiency and solution quality. To tackle this issue, we propose an efficient meta neural heuristic (EMNH), in which a meta-model is first trained and then fine-tuned with a few steps to solve corresponding single-objective subproblems. Specifically, for the training process, a (partial) architecture-shared multi-task model is leveraged to achieve parallel learning for the meta-model, so as to speed up the training; meanwhile, a scaled symmetric sampling method with respect to the weight vectors is designed to stabilize the training. For the fine-tuning process, an efficient hierarchical method is proposed to systematically tackle all the subproblems. Experimental results on the multi-objective traveling salesman problem (MOTSP), multi-objective capacitated vehicle routing problem (MOCVRP), and multi-objective knapsack problem (MOKP) show that, EMNH is able to outperform the state-of-the-art neural heuristics in terms of solution quality and learning efficiency, and yield competitive solutions to the strong traditional heuristics while consuming much shorter time",

It follows that optimal multi-objective agents must admit rewards that are non-Markovian with respect to the individual objectives. To this end, a practical non-Markovian aggregation scheme is proposed, which overcomes the impossibility with only one additional parameter for each objective. This work offers new insights into sequential, multi-objective agency and intertemporal choice, and has practical implications for the design of AI systems deployed to serve multiple generations of principals with varying time preference",

    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "Whenever a binary classifier is used to provide decision support, it typically provides both a label prediction and a confidence value. Then, the decision maker is supposed to use the confidence value to calibrate how much to trust the prediction. In this context, it has been often argued that the confidence value should correspond to a well calibrated estimate of the probability that the predicted label matches the ground truth label. However, multiple lines of empirical evidence suggest that decision makers have difficulties at developing a good sense on when to trust a prediction using these confidence values. In this paper, our goal is first to understand why and then investigate how to construct more useful confidence values. We first argue that, for a broad class of utility functions, there exists data distributions for which a rational decision maker is, in general, unlikely to discover the optimal decision policy using the above confidence values—an optimal decision maker would need to sometimes place more (less) trust on predictions with lower (higher) confidence values. However, we then show that, if the confidence values satisfy a natural alignment property with respect to the decision maker's confidence on her own predictions, there always exists an optimal decision policy under which the level of trust the decision maker would need to place on predictions is monotone on the confidence values, facilitating its discoverability. Further, we show that multicalibration with respect to the decision maker's confidence on her own prediction is a sufficient condition for alignment. Experiments on a real AI-assisted decision making scenario where a classifier provides decision support to human decision makers validate our theoretical results and suggest that alignment may lead to better decisions",

This measure of the \"effective smoothness\" of a function is sensitive to the underlying distribution and can be dramatically smaller than its classic \"worst-case\" Hölder constant. We consider both the realizable and the agnostic (noisy) regression settings, proving upper and lower risk bounds in terms of the average Hölder smoothness; these rates improve upon both previously known rates even in the special case of average Lipschitz smoothness. Moreover, our lower bound is tight in the realizable setting up to log factors, thus we establish the minimax rate. From an algorithmic perspective, since our notion of average smoothness is defined with respect to the unknown underlying distribution, the learner does not have an explicit representation of the function class, hence is unable to execute ERM. Nevertheless, we provide distinct learning algorithms that achieve both (nearly) optimal learning rates. Our results hold in any totally bounded metric space, and are stated in terms of its intrinsic geometry. Overall, our results show that the classic worst-case notion of Hölder smoothness can be essentially replaced by its average, yielding considerably sharper guarantees",

To alleviate the discrepancy, we propose Correlated latent space Bayesian Optimization (CoBO), which focuses on learning correlated latent spaces characterized by a strong correlation between the distances in the latent space and the distances within the objective function. Specifically, our method introduces Lipschitz regularization, loss weighting, and trust region recoordination to minimize the inherent gap around the promising areas. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on several optimization tasks in discrete data, such as molecule design and arithmetic expression fitting, and achieve high performance within a small budget",

    "title": "Interpreting Unsupervised Anomaly Detection in Security via Rule Extraction",
    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "Many security applications require unsupervised anomaly detection, as malicious data are extremely rare and often only unlabeled normal data are available for training (i.e., zero-positive). However, security operators are concerned about the high stakes of trusting black-box models due to their lack of interpretability. In this paper, we propose a post-hoc method to globally explain a black-box unsupervised anomaly detection model via rule extraction. First, we propose the concept of distribution decomposition rules that decompose the complex distribution of normal data into multiple compositional distributions. To find such rules, we design an unsupervised Interior Clustering Tree that incorporates the model prediction into the splitting criteria. Then, we propose the Compositional Boundary Exploration (CBE) algorithm to obtain the boundary inference rules that estimate the decision boundary of the original model on each compositional distribution. By merging these two types of rules into a rule set, we can present the inferential process of the unsupervised black-box model in a human-understandable way, and build a surrogate rule-based model for online deployment at the same time. We conduct comprehensive experiments on the explanation of four distinct unsupervised anomaly detection models on various real-world datasets. The evaluation shows that our method outperforms existing methods in terms of diverse metrics including fidelity, correctness and robustness",

    "abstract": "Obtaining large pre-trained models that can be fine-tuned to new tasks with limited annotated samples has remained an open challenge for medical imaging data. While pre-trained networks on ImageNet and vision-language foundation models trained on web-scale data are the prevailing approaches, their effectiveness on medical tasks is limited due to the significant domain shift between natural and medical images. To bridge this gap, we introduce LVM-Med, the first family of deep networks trained on large-scale medical datasets. We have collected approximately 1.3 million medical images from 55 publicly available datasets, covering a large number of organs and modalities such as CT, MRI, X-ray, and Ultrasound. We benchmark several state-of-the-art self-supervised algorithms on this dataset and propose a novel self-supervised contrastive learning algorithm using a graph-matching formulation. The proposed approach makes three contributions: (i) it integrates prior pair-wise image similarity metrics based on local and global information; (ii) it captures the structural constraints of feature embeddings through a loss function constructed through a combinatorial graph-matching objective, and (iii) it can be trained efficiently end-to-end using modern gradient-estimation techniques for black-box solvers. We thoroughly evaluate the proposed LVM-Med on 15 downstream medical tasks ranging from segmentation and classification to object detection, and both for the in and out-of-distribution settings. LVM-Med empirically outperforms a number of state-of-the-art supervised, self-supervised, and foundation models.

To address these challenges, we propose a novel method that embeds visual embeddings into a hyperbolic space and enhances their discriminative ability with a hierarchical cosine margins manner. Specifically, the hyperbolic space offers distinct advantages, including the ability to capture hierarchical relationships and increased expressive power, which favors modeling fine-grained objects. Based on the hyperbolic space, we further enforce relatively large/small similarity margins between coarse/fine classes, respectively, yielding the so-called hierarchical cosine margins manner. While enforcing similarity margins in the regular Euclidean space has become popular for deep embedding learning, applying it to the hyperbolic space is non-trivial and validating the benefit for coarse-to-fine generalization is valuable.

In this paper, we reformulate the multi-view clustering problem from an information-theoretic perspective and propose a general theoretical model. In particular, we define three desiderata under multi-view unsupervised learning in terms of mutual information, namely, comprehensiveness, concentration, and cross-diversity. The multi-view variational lower bound is then obtained by approximating the samples' high-dimensional mutual information. The Kullback–Leibler divergence is utilized to deduce sample assignments. Ultimately the information-based multi-view clustering model leverages deep neural networks and Stochastic Gradient Variational Bayes to achieve representation learning and clustering simultaneously.

    "abstract": "In a standard view of the reinforcement learning problem, an agent's goal is to efficiently identify a policy that maximizes long-term reward. However, this perspective is based on a restricted view of learning as finding a solution, rather than treating learning as endless adaptation. In contrast, continual reinforcement learning refers to the setting in which the best agents never stop learning. Despite the importance of continual reinforcement learning, the community lacks a simple definition of the problem that highlights its commitments and makes its primary concepts precise and clear. To this end, this paper is dedicated to carefully defining the continual reinforcement learning problem. We formalize the notion of agents that \"never stop learning\" through a new mathematical language for analyzing and cataloging agents. Using this new language, we define a continual learning agent as one that can be understood as carrying out an implicit search process indefinitely, and continual reinforcement learning as the setting in which the best agents are all continual learning agents. We provide two motivating examples, illustrating that traditional views of multi-task reinforcement learning and continual supervised learning are special cases of our definition. Collectively, these definitions and perspectives formalize many intuitive concepts at the heart of learning, and open new research pathways surrounding continual learning agents",

    "abstract": "Synthesizing novel view images from a few views is a challenging but practical problem. Existing methods often struggle with producing high-quality results or necessitate per-object optimization in such few-view settings due to the insufficient information provided. In this work, we explore leveraging the strong 2D priors in pre-trained diffusion models for synthesizing novel view images. 2D diffusion models, nevertheless, lack 3D awareness, leading to distorted image synthesis and compromising the identity. To address these problems, we propose $\\textit{DreamSparse}$, a framework that enables the frozen pre-trained diffusion model to generate geometry and identity-consistent novel view images. Specifically, DreamSparse incorporates a geometry module designed to capture features about spatial information from sparse views as a 3D prior. Subsequently, a spatial guidance model is introduced to convert rendered feature maps as spatial information for the generative process. This information is then used to guide the pre-trained diffusion model to encourage the synthesis of geometrically consistent images without further tuning. Leveraging the strong image priors in the pre-trained diffusion models, DreamSparse is capable of synthesizing high-quality novel views for both object and object-centric scene-level images and generalising to open-set images. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework can effectively synthesize novel view images from sparse views and outperforms baselines in both trained and open-set category images.

An advantage of this approach is the ability to estimate these transformations using standard, well-understood algebraic procedures that have closed-form solutions. Our method directly estimates a transformation between two given latent spaces, thereby enabling effective stitching of encoders and decoders without additional training. We extensively validate the adaptability of this translation procedure in different experimental settings: across various trainings, domains, architectures (e.g., ResNet, CNN, ViT), and in multiple downstream tasks (classification, reconstruction).

    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "As more deep learning models are being applied in real-world applications, there is a growing need for modeling and learning the representations of neural networks themselves. An effective representation can be used to predict target attributes of networks without the need for actual training and deployment procedures, facilitating efficient network design and deployment. Recently, inspired by the success of Transformer, some Transformer-based representation learning frameworks have been proposed and achieved promising performance in handling cell-structured models. However, graph neural network (GNN) based approaches still dominate the field of learning representation for the entire network. In this paper, we revisit the Transformer and compare it with GNN to analyze their different architectural characteristics. We then propose a modified Transformer-based universal neural network representation learning model NAR-Former V2. It can learn efficient representations from both cell-structured networks and entire networks. Specifically, we first take the network as a graph and design a straightforward tokenizer to encode the network into a sequence. Then, we incorporate the inductive representation learning capability of GNN into Transformer, enabling Transformer to generalize better when encountering unseen architecture. Additionally, we introduce a series of simple yet effective modifications to enhance the ability of the Transformer in learning representation from graph structures. In encoding entire networks and then predicting the latency, our proposed method surpasses the GNN-based method NNLP by a significant margin on the NNLQP dataset. Furthermore, regarding accuracy prediction on the cell-structured NASBench101 and NASBench201 datasets, our method achieves highly comparable performance to other state-of-the-art methods.

Traditional GCL methods generate views in the spatial domain, but it has been recently discovered that the spectral domain also plays a vital role in complementing spatial views. However, existing spectral-based graph views either ignore the eigenvectors that encode valuable positional information or suffer from high complexity when trying to address the instability of spectral features. To tackle these challenges, we first design an informative, stable, and scalable spectral encoder, termed EigenMLP, to learn effective representations from the spectral features. Theoretically, EigenMLP is invariant to the rotation and reflection transformations on eigenvectors and robust against perturbations. Then, we propose a spatial-spectral contrastive framework (Sp$^{2}$GCL) to capture the consistency between the spatial information encoded by graph neural networks and the spectral information learned by EigenMLP, thus effectively fusing these two graph views.

Recent GNN-based approaches formulate this task as a KG path searching problem, where messages are sequentially propagated from the seed node towards the answer nodes. However, these messages are past-oriented, and they do not consider the full KG context. To make matters worse, KG nodes often represent pronoun entities and are sometimes encrypted, being uninformative in selecting between paths. To address these problems, we propose Neural Tree Search (NuTrea), a tree search-based GNN model that incorporates the broader KG context. Our model adopts a message-passing scheme that probes the unreached subtree regions to boost the past-oriented embeddings. In addition, we introduce the Relation Frequency-Inverse Entity Frequency (RF-IEF) node embedding that considers the global KG context to better characterize ambiguous KG nodes. The general effectiveness of our approach is demonstrated through experiments on three major multi-hop KGQA benchmark datasets, and our extensive analyses further validate its expressiveness and robustness.

To capture compositional entities of the scene, we proposed cyclic walks between perceptual features extracted from vision transformers and object entities. First, a slot-attention module interfaces with these perceptual features and produces a finite set of slot representations. These slots can bind to any object entities in the scene via inter-slot competitions for attention. Next, we establish entity-feature correspondence with cyclic walks along high transition probability based on the pairwise similarity between perceptual features (aka \"parts\") and slot-binded object representations (aka \"whole\"). The whole is greater than its parts and the parts constitute the whole. The part-whole interactions form cycle consistencies, as supervisory signals, to train the slot-attention module.

Prior works either transformed circuit designs into images using hand-crafted methods and then used Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to extract features, which are limited by the quality of the hand-crafted methods and could not achieve end-to-end training, or treated the circuit design as a graph structure and used Graph Neural Networks (GNN) to extract features, which require time-consuming preprocessing.

However, as we move up the visual hierarchy, the complexity of neuronal computations increases. Consequently, it becomes more challenging to model neuronal activity, requiring more complex models. In this study, we introduce a novel readout architecture inspired by the mechanism of visual attention. This new architecture, which we call attention readout, together with a data-driven convolutional core outperforms previous task-driven models in predicting the activity of neurons in macaque area V4. However, as our predictive network becomes deeper and more complex, synthesizing MEIs via straightforward gradient ascent (GA) can struggle to produce qualitatively good results and overfit to idiosyncrasies of a more complex model, potentially decreasing the MEI's model-to-brain transferability. To solve this problem, we propose a diffusion-based method for generating MEIs via Energy Guidance (EGG). We show that for models of macaque V4, EGG generates single neuron MEIs that generalize better across varying model architectures than the state-of-the-art GA, while at the same time reducing computational costs by a factor of 4.7x, facilitating experimentally challenging closed-loop experiments. Furthermore, EGG diffusion can be used to generate other neurally exciting images, like most exciting naturalistic images that are on par with a selection of highly activating natural images, or image reconstructions that generalize better across architectures. Finally, EGG is simple to implement, requires no retraining of the diffusion model, and can easily be generalized to provide other characterizations of the visual system, such as invariances. Thus, EGG provides a general and flexible framework to study the coding properties of the visual system in the context of natural images",

However, the distributed nature and uninvestigated data intuitively introduce new security vulnerabilities, including backdoor attacks. In this scenario, an adversary implants backdoor functionality into the global model during training, which can be activated to cause the desired misbehaviors for any input with a specific adversarial pattern. Despite having remarkable success in triggering and distorting model behavior, prior backdoor attacks in FL often hold impractical assumptions, limited imperceptibility, and durability. Specifically, the adversary needs to control a sufficiently large fraction of clients or know the data distribution of other honest clients. In many cases, the trigger inserted is often visually apparent, and the backdoor effect is quickly diluted if the adversary is removed from the training process. To address these limitations, we propose a novel backdoor attack framework in FL, \\dung{the \\textbf{Irreversible Backdoor Attack} (\\texttt{IBA})}, that jointly learns the optimal and visually stealthy trigger and then gradually implants the backdoor into a global model. This approach allows the adversary to execute a backdoor attack that can evade both human and machine inspections. Additionally, we enhance the efficiency and durability of the proposed attack by selectively poisoning the model's parameters that are least likely updated by the main task's learning process and constraining the poisoned model update to the vicinity of the global model. Finally, we evaluate the proposed attack framework on several benchmark datasets, including MNIST, CIFAR-10, and Tiny ImageNet, and achieved high success rates while simultaneously bypassing existing backdoor defenses and achieving a more durable backdoor effect compared to other backdoor attacks.

    "title": "SAME: Uncovering GNN Black Box with Structure-aware Shapley-based Multipiece Explanations",
    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "Post-hoc explanation techniques on graph neural networks (GNNs) provide economical solutions for opening the black-box graph models without model retraining. Many GNN explanation variants have achieved state-of-the-art explaining results on a diverse set of benchmarks, while they rarely provide theoretical analysis for their inherent properties and explanatory capability. In this work, we propose $\\underline{\\text{S}}$tructure-$\\underline{\\text{A}}$ware Shapley-based $\\underline{\\text{M}}$ultipiece $\\underline{\\text{E}}$xplanation (SAME) method to address the structure-aware feature interactions challenges for GNNs explanation. Specifically, SAME leverages an expansion-based Monte Carlo tree search to explore the multi-grained structure-aware connected substructure. Afterward, the explanation results are encouraged to be informative of the graph properties by optimizing the combination of distinct single substructures. With the consideration of fair feature interactions in the process of investigating multiple connected important substructures, the explanation provided by SAME has the potential to be as explainable as the theoretically optimal explanation obtained by the Shapley value within polynomial time. Extensive experiments on real-world and synthetic benchmarks show that SAME improves the previous state-of-the-art fidelity performance by 12.9\\% on BBBP, 7.01\\% on MUTAG, 42.3\\% on Graph-SST2, 38.9\\% on Graph-SST5, 11.3\\% on BA-2Motifs and 18.2\\% on BA-Shapes under the same testing condition.

    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "Evaluating the performance of machine learning models on diverse and underrepresented subgroups is essential for ensuring fairness and reliability in real-world applications. However, accurately assessing model performance becomes challenging due to two main issues: (1) a scarcity of test data, especially for small subgroups, and (2) possible distributional shifts in the model's deployment setting, which may not align with the available test data. In this work, we introduce 3S Testing, a deep generative modeling framework to facilitate model evaluation by generating synthetic test sets for small subgroups and simulating distributional shifts. Our experiments demonstrate that 3S-Testing outperforms traditional baselines---including real test data alone---in estimating model performance on minority subgroups and under plausible distributional shifts. In addition, 3S offers intervals around its performance estimates, exhibiting superior coverage of the ground truth compared to existing approaches. Overall, these results raise the question of whether we need a paradigm shift away from limited real test data towards synthetic test data",

    "title": "Meta-learning families of plasticity rules in recurrent spiking networks using simulation-based inference",
    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "There is substantial experimental evidence that learning and memory-related behaviours rely on local synaptic changes, but the search for distinct plasticity rules has been driven by human intuition, with limited success for multiple, co-active plasticity rules in biological networks. More recently, automated meta-learning approaches have been used in simplified settings, such as rate networks and small feed-forward spiking networks. Here, we develop a simulation-based inference (SBI) method for sequentially filtering plasticity rules through an increasingly fine mesh of constraints that can be modified on-the-fly. This method, _filter SBI_, allows us to infer entire families of complex and co-active plasticity rules in spiking networks. We first consider flexibly parameterized doublet (Hebbian) rules, and find that the set of inferred rules contains solutions that extend and refine -and also reject- predictions from mean-field theory. Next, we expand the search space of plasticity rules by modelling them as multi-layer perceptrons that combine several plasticity-relevant factors, such as weight, voltage, triplets and co-dependency. Out of the millions of possible rules, we identify thousands of unique rule combinations that satisfy biological constraints like plausible activity and weight dynamics. The resulting rules can be used as a starting point for further investigations into specific network computations, and already suggest refinements and predictions for classical experimental approaches on plasticity. This flexible approach for principled exploration of complex plasticity rules in large recurrent spiking networks presents the most advanced search tool to date for enabling robust predictions and deep insights into the plasticity mechanisms underlying brain function",

    "abstract": "Providing formal guarantees of algorithmic fairness is of paramount importance to socially responsible deployment of machine learning algorithms. In this work, we study formal guarantees, i.e., certificates, for individual fairness (IF) of neural networks. We start by introducing a novel convex approximation of IF constraints that exponentially decreases the computational cost of providing formal guarantees of local individual fairness. We highlight that prior methods are constrained by their focus on global IF certification and can therefore only scale to models with a few dozen hidden neurons, thus limiting their practical impact. We propose to certify \\textit{distributional} individual fairness which ensures that for a given empirical distribution and all distributions within a $\\gamma$-Wasserstein ball, the neural network has guaranteed individually fair predictions. Leveraging developments in quasi-convex optimization, we provide novel and efficient certified bounds on distributional individual fairness and show that our method allows us to certify and regularize neural networks that are several orders of magnitude larger than those considered by prior works. Moreover, we study real-world distribution shifts and find our bounds to be a scalable, practical, and sound source of IF guarantees",

    "abstract": "Machine learning models are famously vulnerable to adversarial attacks: small ad-hoc perturbations of the data that can catastrophically alter the model predictions. While a large literature has studied the case of test-time attacks on pre-trained models, the important case of attacks in an online learning setting has received little attention so far. In this work, we use a control-theoretical perspective to study the scenario where an attacker may perturb data labels to manipulate the learning dynamics of an online learner. We perform a theoretical analysis of the problem in a teacher-student setup, considering different attack strategies, and obtaining analytical results for the steady state of simple linear learners. These results enable us to prove that a discontinuous transition in the learner's accuracy occurs when the attack strength exceeds a critical threshold. We then study empirically attacks on learners with complex architectures using real data, confirming the insights of our theoretical analysis. Our findings show that greedy attacks can be extremely efficient, especially when data stream in small batches",

    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "The structure of protein-protein complexes is critical for understanding binding dynamics, biological mechanisms, and intervention strategies. Rigid protein docking, a fundamental problem in this field, aims to predict the 3D structure of complexes from their unbound states without conformational changes. In this scenario, we have access to two types of valuable information: sequence-modal information, such as coevolutionary data obtained from multiple sequence alignments, and structure-modal information, including the 3D conformations of rigid structures. However, existing docking methods typically utilize single-modal information, resulting in suboptimal predictions. In this paper, we propose xTrimoBiDock (or BiDock for short), a novel rigid docking model that effectively integrates sequence- and structure-modal information through bi-level optimization. Specifically, a cross-modal transformer combines multimodal information to predict an inter-protein distance map. To achieve rigid docking, the roto-translation transformation is optimized to align the docked pose with the predicted distance map. In order to tackle this bi-level optimization problem, we unroll the gradient descent of the inner loop and further derive a better initialization for roto-translation transformation based on spectral estimation. Compared to baselines, BiDock achieves a promising result of a maximum 234% relative improvement in challenging antibody-antigen docking problem",

    "abstract": "Cognitive diagnosis is an important task in intelligence education, which aims at measuring students' proficiency in specific knowledge concepts. Given a fully labeled exercise-concept matrix, most existing models focused on mining students' response records for cognitive diagnosis. Despite their success, due to the huge cost of labeling exercises, a more practical scenario is that limited exercises are labeled with concepts. Performing cognitive diagnosis with limited exercise labels is under-explored and remains pretty much open. In this paper, we propose Disentanglement based Cognitive Diagnosis (DCD) to address the challenges of limited exercise labels. Specifically, we utilize students' response records to model student proficiency, exercise difficulty and exercise label distribution. Then, we introduce two novel modules - group-based disentanglement and limited-labeled alignment modules - to disentangle the factors relevant to concepts and align them with real limited labels. Particularly, we introduce the tree-like structure of concepts with negligible cost for group-based disentangling, as concepts of different levels exhibit different independence relationships.

    "title": "Switching Temporary Teachers for Semi-Supervised Semantic Segmentation",
    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "The teacher-student framework, prevalent in semi-supervised semantic segmentation, mainly employs the exponential moving average (EMA) to update a single teacher's weights based on the student's. However, EMA updates raise a problem in that the weights of the teacher and student are getting coupled, causing a potential performance bottleneck. Furthermore, this problem may become more severe when training with more complicated labels such as segmentation masks but with few annotated data. This paper introduces Dual Teacher, a simple yet effective approach that employs dual temporary teachers aiming to alleviate the coupling problem for the student. The temporary teachers work in shifts and are progressively improved, so consistently prevent the teacher and student from becoming excessively close. Specifically, the temporary teachers periodically take turns generating pseudo-labels to train a student model and maintain the distinct characteristics of the student model for each epoch. Consequently, Dual Teacher achieves competitive performance on the PASCAL VOC, Cityscapes, and ADE20K benchmarks with remarkably shorter training times than state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, we demonstrate that our approach is model-agnostic and compatible with both CNN- and Transformer-based models. Code is available at https://github.com/naver-ai/dual-teacher",

We recast MLX as a robustness problem, where human explanations specify a lower dimensional manifold from which perturbations can be drawn, and show both theoretically and empirically how this approach alleviates the need for strong model smoothing. We consider various approaches to achieving robustness, leading to improved performance over prior MLX methods.

    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "Despite their prevalence in deep-learning communities, over-parameterized models convey high demands of computational costs for proper training. This work studies the fine-grained, modular-level learning dynamics of over-parameterized models to attain a more efficient and fruitful training strategy. Empirical evidence reveals that when scaling down into network modules, such as heads in self-attention models, we can observe varying learning patterns implicitly associated with each module's trainability. To describe such modular-level learning capabilities, we introduce a novel concept dubbed modular neural tangent kernel (mNTK), and we demonstrate that the quality of a module's learning is tightly associated with its mNTK's principal eigenvalue $\\lambda_{\\max}$. A large $\\lambda_{\\max}$ indicates that the module learns features with better convergence, while those miniature ones may impact generalization negatively. Inspired by the discovery, we propose a novel training strategy termed Modular Adaptive Training (MAT) to update those modules with their $\\lambda_{\\max}$ exceeding a dynamic threshold selectively, concentrating the model on learning common features and ignoring those inconsistent ones. Unlike most existing training schemes with a complete BP cycle across all network modules, MAT can significantly save computations by its partially-updating strategy and can further improve performance. Experiments show that MAT nearly halves the computational cost of model training and outperforms the accuracy of baselines",

The majority of cutting plane approaches rely on explicit rules to derive valid inequalities that can separate the target point from the feasible set. Local cuts, on the other hand, seek to directly derive the facets of the underlying polyhedron and use them as cutting planes. However, current approaches rely on solving Linear Programming (LP) problems in order to derive such a hyperplane. In this paper, we present a novel generic approach for learning the facets of the underlying polyhedron by accessing it implicitly via an enumeration oracle in a reduced dimension. This is achieved by embedding the oracle in a variant of the Frank-Wolfe algorithm which is capable of generating strong cutting planes, effectively turning the enumeration oracle into a separation oracle. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach with a case study targeting the multidimensional knapsack problem (MKP)",

Employing generative refusals is crucial in upholding the ethical and copyright integrity of synthesized content, particularly when working with widely adopted diffusion models. \"Concept negation'' presents a promising paradigm to achieve generative refusals, as it effectively defines and governs the model's output space based on concepts, utilizing natural language interfaces that are readily comprehensible to humans. However, despite the valuable contributions of prior research to the field of concept negation, it still suffers from significant limitations. The existing concept negation methods, which operate based on the composition of score or noise predictions from the diffusion process, are limited to independent concepts (e.g., ``a blonde girl`` without ``glasses``) and fail to consider the interconnected nature of concepts in reality (e.g., ``Mickey mouse eats ice cream`` without ``Disney characters``). Keeping the limitations in mind, we propose a novel framework, called $ProtoRe$, to improve the flexibility of concept negation via test-time negative concept identification along with purification in the feature space. $ProtoRe$ works by incorporating CLIP's language-contrastive knowledge to identify the prototype of negative concepts, extract the negative features from outputs using the prototype as a prompt, and further refine the attention maps by retrieving negative features. Our evaluation on multiple benchmarks shows that $ProtoRe$ outperforms state-of-the-art methods under various settings, in terms of the effectiveness of purification and the fidelity of generative images",

Such sub-functions have two important features: they have a distinct set of inputs (input-separability) and they are reused as inputs higher in the hierarchy (reusability). Previous studies have established that hierarchically modular neural networks, which are inherently sparse, offer benefits such as learning efficiency, generalization, multi-task learning, and transfer. However, identifying the underlying sub-functions and their hierarchical structure for a given task can be challenging. The high-level question in this work is: if we learn a task using a sufficiently deep neural network, how can we uncover the underlying hierarchy of sub-functions in that task? As a starting point, we examine the domain of Boolean functions, where it is easier to determine whether a task is hierarchically modular. We propose an approach based on iterative unit and edge pruning (during training), combined with network analysis for module detection and hierarchy inference.

The common approach is to incorporate a penalty term to reward or value estimation in the Bellman iterations.

In this paper, we propose Conservative State Value Estimation (CSVE), a new approach that learns conservative V-function via directly imposing penalty on OOD states. Compared to prior work, CSVE allows more effective state value estimation with conservative guarantees and further better policy optimization. Further, we apply CSVE and develop a practical actor-critic algorithm in which the critic does the conservative value estimation by additionally sampling and penalizing the states around the dataset, and the actor applies advantage weighted updates extended with state exploration to improve the policy. We evaluate in classic continual control tasks of D4RL, showing that our method performs better than the conservative Q-function learning methods and is strongly competitive among recent SOTA methods",

However, these methods rely on augmentations that mimic low-pass filters, limiting their performance on tasks requiring different eigen-spectrum parts. This paper presents a simple filter-based augmentation method to capture different parts of the eigen-spectrum. We show significant improvements using these augmentations. Further, we show that sharing the same weights across these different filter augmentations is possible, reducing the computational load. In addition, previous works have shown that good performance on downstream tasks requires high dimensional representations.

    "abstract": "Computational tractability and social welfare (aka. efficiency) of equilibria are two fundamental but in general orthogonal considerations in algorithmic game theory. Nevertheless, we show that when (approximate) full efficiency can be guaranteed via a smoothness argument a la Roughgarden, Nash equilibria are approachable under a family of no-regret learning algorithms, thereby enabling fast and decentralized computation. We leverage this connection to obtain new convergence results in large games---wherein the number of players $n \\gg 1$---under the well-documented property of full efficiency via smoothness in the limit. Surprisingly, our framework unifies equilibrium computation in disparate classes of problems including games with vanishing strategic sensitivity and two-player zero-sum games, illuminating en route an immediate but overlooked equivalence between smoothness and a well-studied condition in the optimization literature known as the Minty property. Finally, we establish that a family of no-regret dynamics attains a welfare bound that improves over the smoothness framework while at the same time guaranteeing convergence to the set of coarse correlated equilibria. We show this by employing the clairvoyant mirror descent algortihm recently introduced by Piliouras et al",

    "title": "ContinuAR: Continuous Autoregression For Infinite-Fidelity Fusion",
    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "Multi-fidelity fusion has become an important surrogate technique, which provides insights into expensive computer simulations and effectively improves decision-making, e.g., optimization, with less computational cost. Multi-fidelity fusion is much more computationally efficient compared to traditional single-fidelity surrogates. Despite the fast advancement of multi-fidelity fusion techniques, they lack a systematic framework to make use of the fidelity indicator, deal with high-dimensional and arbitrary data structure, and scale well to infinite-fidelity problems. In this work, we first generalize the popular autoregression (AR) to derive a novel linear fidelity differential equation (FiDE), paving the way to tractable infinite-fidelity fusion. We generalize FiDE to a high-dimensional system, which also provides a unifying framework to seemly bridge the gap between many multi- and single-fidelity GP-based models. We then propose ContinuAR, a rank-1 approximation solution to FiDEs, which is tractable to train, compatible with arbitrary multi-fidelity data structure, linearly scalable to the output dimension, and most importantly, delivers consistent SOTA performance with a significant margin over the baseline methods. Compared to the SOTA infinite-fidelity fusion, IFC, ContinuAR achieves up to 4x improvement in accuracy and 62,500x speedup in training time",

    "title": "CS-Isolate: Extracting Hard Confident Examples by Content and Style Isolation",
    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "Label noise widely exists in large-scale image datasets. To mitigate the side effects of label noise, state-of-the-art methods focus on selecting confident examples by leveraging semi-supervised learning. Existing research shows that the ability to extract hard confident examples, which are close to the decision boundary, significantly influences the generalization ability of the learned classifier. In this paper, we find that a key reason for some hard examples being close to the decision boundary is due to the entanglement of style factors with content factors. The hard examples become more discriminative when we focus solely on content factors, such as semantic information, while ignoring style factors. Nonetheless, given only noisy data, content factors are not directly observed and have to be inferred. To tackle the problem of inferring content factors for classification when learning with noisy labels, our objective is to ensure that the content factors of all examples in the same underlying clean class remain unchanged as their style information changes. To achieve this, we utilize different data augmentation techniques to alter the styles while regularizing content factors based on some confident examples. By training existing methods with our inferred content factors, CS-Isolate proves their effectiveness in learning hard examples on benchmark datasets.

    "title": "Beyond Pretrained Features: Noisy Image Modeling Provides Adversarial Defense",
    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "Recent advancements in masked image modeling (MIM) have made it a prevailing framework for self-supervised visual representation learning. The MIM pretrained models, like most deep neural network methods, remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks, limiting their practical application, and this issue has received little research attention. In this paper, we investigate how this powerful self-supervised learning paradigm can provide adversarial robustness to downstream classifiers. During the exploration, we find that noisy image modeling (NIM), a simple variant of MIM that adopts denoising as the pre-text task, reconstructs noisy images surprisingly well despite severe corruption. Motivated by this observation, we propose an adversarial defense method, referred to as De^3, by exploiting the pretrained decoder for denoising. Through De^3, NIM is able to enhance adversarial robustness beyond providing pretrained features. Furthermore, we incorporate a simple modification, sampling the noise scale hyperparameter from random distributions, and enable the defense to achieve a better and tunable trade-off between accuracy and robustness. Experimental results demonstrate that, in terms of adversarial robustness, NIM is superior to MIM thanks to its effective denoising capability. Moreover, the defense provided by NIM achieves performance on par with adversarial training while offering the extra tunability advantage.

    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "Weight Average (WA) is an active research topic due to its simplicity in ensembling deep networks and the effectiveness in promoting generalization. Existing weight average approaches, however, are often carried out along only one training trajectory in a post-hoc manner (i.e., the weights are averaged after the entire training process is finished), which significantly degrades the diversity between networks and thus impairs the effectiveness. In this paper, inspired by weight average, we propose Lookaround, a straightforward yet effective SGD-based optimizer leading to flatter minima with better generalization. Specifically, Lookaround iterates two steps during the whole training period: the around step and the average step. In each iteration, 1) the around step starts from a common point and trains multiple networks simultaneously, each on transformed data by a different data augmentation, and 2) the average step averages these trained networks to get the averaged network, which serves as the starting point for the next iteration. The around step improves the functionality diversity while the average step guarantees the weight locality of these networks during the whole training, which is essential for WA to work. We theoretically explain the superiority of Lookaround by convergence analysis, and make extensive experiments to evaluate Lookaround on popular benchmarks including CIFAR and ImageNet with both CNNs and ViTs, demonstrating clear superiority over state-of-the-arts.

    "abstract": "Locally interpretable model agnostic explanations (LIME) method is one of the most popular methods used to explain black-box models at a per example level. Although many variants have been proposed, few provide a simple way to produce high fidelity explanations that are also stable and intuitive. In this work, we provide a novel perspective by proposing a model agnostic local explanation method inspired by the invariant risk minimization (IRM) principle -- originally proposed for (global) out-of-distribution generalization -- to provide such high fidelity explanations that are also stable and unidirectional across nearby examples. Our method is based on a game theoretic formulation where we theoretically show that our approach has a strong tendency to eliminate features where the gradient of the black-box function abruptly changes sign in the locality of the example we want to explain, while in other cases it is more careful and will choose a more conservative (feature) attribution, a behavior which can be highly desirable for recourse. Empirically, we show on tabular, image and text data that the quality of our explanations with neighborhoods formed using random perturbations are much better than LIME and in some cases even comparable to other methods that use realistic neighbors sampled from the data manifold. This is desirable given that learning a manifold to either create realistic neighbors or to project explanations is typically expensive or may even be impossible. Moreover, our algorithm is simple and efficient to train, and can ascertain stable input features for local decisions of a black-box without access to side information such as a (partial) causal graph as has been seen in some recent works",

    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "Transformer models have been widely adopted in various domains over the last years and especially large language models have advanced the field of AI significantly. Due to their size, the capability of these networks has increased tremendously, but this has come at the cost of a significant increase in necessary compute. Quantization is one of the most effective ways for reducing the computational time and memory consumption of neural networks. Many studies have shown, however, that modern transformer models tend to learn strong outliers in their activations, making them difficult to quantize. To retain acceptable performance, the existence of these outliers requires activations to be in higher-bitwidth or the use of different numeric formats, extra fine-tuning, or other workarounds. We show that strong outliers are related to very specific behavior of attention heads that try to learn a \"no-op\", or just a partial update of the residual. To achieve the exact zeros needed in the attention matrix for a no-update, the input to the softmax is pushed to be larger and larger during training, causing outliers in other parts of the network. Based on these observations, we propose two simple (independent) modifications to the attention mechanism - _clipped softmax_ and _gated attention_. We empirically show that models pre-trained using our methods learn significantly smaller outliers while maintaining and sometimes even improving the floating-point task performance. This enables us to quantize transformers to full INT8 quantization of the activations without any additional effort. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods on both language models (BERT, OPT) and vision transformers",

To fill this gap, we establish a general stability bound in this not independently and identically distributed (non-i.i.d.) setting, where the learned distribution is dependent on the original train set and generally not the same as the true distribution. Our theoretical result includes the divergence between the learned distribution and the true distribution. It shows that generative data augmentation can enjoy a faster learning rate when the order of divergence term is $o(\\max\\left( \\log(m)\\beta_m, 1 / \\sqrt{m})\\right)$, where $m$ is the train set size and $\\beta_m$ is the corresponding stability constant. We further specify the learning setup to the Gaussian mixture model and generative adversarial nets. We prove that in both cases, though generative data augmentation does not enjoy a faster learning rate, it can improve the learning guarantees at a constant level when the train set is small, which is significant when the awful overfitting occurs.

Prior work in the literature has proposed to address this problem by designing architectures trained end-to-end for the complex query answering task with a reasoning process that is hard to interpret while requiring data and resource-intensive training. Other lines of research have proposed re-using simple neural link predictors to answer complex queries, reducing the amount of training data by orders of magnitude while providing interpretable answers. The neural link predictor used in such approaches is not explicitly optimised for the complex query answering task, implying that its scores are not calibrated to interact together. We propose to address these problems via CQD$^{\\mathcal{A}}$, a parameter-efficient score \\emph{adaptation} model optimised to re-calibrate neural link prediction scores for the complex query answering task. While the neural link predictor is frozen, the adaptation component -- which only increases the number of model parameters by $0.03\\%$ -- is trained on the downstream complex query answering task. Furthermore, the calibration component enables us to support reasoning over queries that include atomic negations, which was previously impossible with link predictors. In our experiments, CQD$^{\\mathcal{A}}$ produces significantly more accurate results than current state-of-the-art methods, improving from $34.4$ to $35.1$ Mean Reciprocal Rank values averaged across all datasets and query types while using $\\leq 30\\%$ of the available training query types.

For instance, Boltzmann generators tackle the long-standing sampling problem in statistical physics by training flows to produce equilibrium samples of many-body systems such as small molecules and proteins. To build effective models for such systems, it is crucial to incorporate the symmetries of the target energy into the model, which can be achieved by equivariant continuous normalizing flows (CNFs). However, CNFs can be computationally expensive to train and generate samples from, which has hampered their scalability and practical application. In this paper, we introduce equivariant flow matching, a new training objective for equivariant CNFs that is based on the recently proposed optimal transport flow matching. Equivariant flow matching exploits the physical symmetries of the target energy for efficient, simulation-free training of equivariant CNFs. We demonstrate the effectiveness of flow matching on rotation and permutation invariant many-particle systems and a small molecule, alanine dipeptide, where for the first time we obtain a Boltzmann generator with significant sampling efficiency without relying on tailored internal coordinate featurization.

Our approach leverages transformer architectures by utilizing a Vision Transformer model as an encoder for capturing global-correlated image features.

    "title": "The Contextual Lasso: Sparse Linear Models via Deep Neural Networks",
    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "Sparse linear models are one of several core tools for interpretable machine learning, a field of emerging importance as predictive models permeate decision-making in many domains. Unfortunately, sparse linear models are far less flexible as functions of their input features than black-box models like deep neural networks. With this capability gap in mind, we study a not-uncommon situation where the input features dichotomize into two groups: explanatory features, which are candidates for inclusion as variables in an interpretable model, and contextual features, which select from the candidate variables and determine their effects. This dichotomy leads us to the contextual lasso, a new statistical estimator that fits a sparse linear model to the explanatory features such that the sparsity pattern and coefficients vary as a function of the contextual features. The fitting process learns this function nonparametrically via a deep neural network. To attain sparse coefficients, we train the network with a novel lasso regularizer in the form of a projection layer that maps the network's output onto the space of $\\ell_1$-constrained linear models. An extensive suite of experiments on real and synthetic data suggests that the learned models, which remain highly transparent, can be sparser than the regular lasso without sacrificing the predictive power of a standard deep neural network",

    "abstract": "Graph-based semi-supervised learning (GSSL) serves as a powerful tool to model the underlying manifold structures of samples in high-dimensional spaces. It involves two phases: constructing an affinity graph from available data and inferring labels for unlabeled nodes on this graph. While numerous algorithms have been developed for label inference, the crucial graph construction phase has received comparatively less attention, despite its significant influence on the subsequent phase. In this paper, we present an optimal asymmetric graph structure for the label inference phase with theoretical motivations. Unlike existing graph construction methods, we differentiate the distinct roles that labeled nodes and unlabeled nodes could play. Accordingly, we design an efficient block-wise graph learning algorithm with a global convergence guarantee. Other benefits induced by our method, such as enhanced robustness to noisy node features, are explored as well. Finally, we perform extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets to demonstrate its superiority to the state-of-the-art graph construction methods in GSSL",

    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "Pseudo labeling (PL) is a wide-applied strategy to enlarge the labeled dataset by self-annotating the potential samples during the training process. Several works have shown that it can improve the graph learning model performance in general. However, we notice that the incorrect labels can be fatal to the graph training process. Inappropriate PL may result in the performance degrading, especially on graph data where the noise can propagate. Surprisingly, the corresponding error is seldom theoretically analyzed in the literature. In this paper, we aim to give deep insights of PL on graph learning models. We first present the error analysis of PL strategy by showing that the error is bounded by the confidence of PL threshold and consistency of multi-view prediction. Then, we theoretically illustrate the effect of PL on convergence property. Based on the analysis, we propose a cautious pseudo labeling methodology in which we pseudo label the samples with highest confidence and multi-view consistency. Finally, extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed strategy improves graph learning process and outperforms other PL strategies on link prediction and node classification tasks",

    "abstract": "We propose a causal interpretation of self-attention in the Transformer neural network architecture. We interpret self-attention as a mechanism that estimates a structural equation model for a given input sequence of symbols (tokens). The structural equation model can be interpreted, in turn, as a causal structure over the input symbols under the specific context of the input sequence. Importantly, this interpretation remains valid in the presence of latent confounders. Following this interpretation, we estimate conditional independence relations between input symbols by calculating partial correlations between their corresponding representations in the deepest attention layer. This enables learning the causal structure over an input sequence using existing constraint-based algorithms. In this sense, existing pre-trained Transformers can be utilized for zero-shot causal-discovery. We demonstrate this method by providing causal explanations for the outcomes of Transformers in two tasks: sentiment classification (NLP) and recommendation",

Considering these issues, we introduce, for the first time, an optimal stopping policy gradient algorithm (OSPG) that can leverage RNNs effectively in non-Markovian settings by implicitly optimizing value functions without recursion, mitigating the curse of non-Markovianity.

    "abstract": "Last-iterate convergence has received extensive study in two player zero-sum games starting from bilinear, convex-concave up to settings that satisfy the MVI condition. Typical methods that exhibit last-iterate convergence for the aforementioned games include extra-gradient (EG) and optimistic gradient descent ascent (OGDA). However, all the established last-iterate convergence results hold for the restrictive setting where the underlying repeated game does not change over time. Recently, a line of research has focused on regret analysis of OGDA in time-varying games, i.e., games where payoffs evolve with time; the last-iterate behavior of OGDA and EG in time-varying environments remains unclear though. In this paper, we study the last-iterate behavior of various algorithms in two types of unconstrained, time-varying, bilinear zero-sum games: periodic and convergent perturbed games. These models expand upon the usual repeated game formulation and incorporate external environmental factors, such as the seasonal effects on species competition and vanishing external noise. In periodic games, we prove that EG will converge while OGDA and momentum method will diverge. This is quite surprising, as to the best of our knowledge, it is the first result that indicates EG and OGDA have qualitatively different last-iterate behaviors and do not exhibit similar behavior. In convergent perturbed games, we prove all these algorithms converge as long as the game itself stabilizes with a faster rate than $1/t$",

    "abstract": "Simultaneous sequence generation is a pivotal task for real-time scenarios, such as streaming speech recognition, simultaneous machine translation and simultaneous speech translation, where the target sequence is generated while receiving the source sequence. The crux of achieving high-quality generation with low latency lies in identifying the optimal moments for generating, accomplished by learning a mapping between the source and target sequences. However, existing methods often rely on task-specific heuristics for different sequence types, limiting the model's capacity to adaptively learn the source-target mapping and hindering the exploration of multi-task learning for various simultaneous tasks. In this paper, we propose a unified segment-to-segment framework (Seg2Seg) for simultaneous sequence generation, which learns the mapping in an adaptive and unified manner. During the process of simultaneous generation, the model alternates between waiting for a source segment and generating a target segment, making the segment serve as the natural bridge between the source and target. To accomplish this, Seg2Seg introduces a latent segment as the pivot between source to target and explores all potential source-target mappings via the proposed expectation training, thereby learning the optimal moments for generating. Experiments on multiple simultaneous generation tasks demonstrate that Seg2Seg achieves state-of-the-art performance and exhibits better generality across various tasks",

To address this, here we present a novel energy-based model (EBM) framework for adaptive context control by modeling the posterior of context vectors. Specifically, we first formulate EBMs of latent image representations and text embeddings in each cross-attention layer of the denoising autoencoder. Then, we obtain the gradient of the log posterior of context vectors, which can be updated and transferred to the subsequent cross-attention layer, thereby implicitly minimizing a nested hierarchy of energy functions. Our latent EBMs further allow zero-shot compositional generation as a linear combination of cross-attention outputs from different contexts.

This new framework addresses many concerns about the biological-plausibility of conventional artificial neural networks and the backpropagation algorithm. The coordinate descent-based optimization of the corresponding objective, combined with the mean square error loss function for fitting labeled supervision data, gives rise to a neural network structure that emulates a more biologically realistic network of multi-compartment pyramidal neurons with dendritic processing and lateral inhibitory neurons. Furthermore, our approach provides a natural resolution to the weight symmetry problem between forward and backward signal propagation paths, a significant critique against the plausibility of the conventional backpropagation algorithm. This is achieved by leveraging two alternative, yet equivalent forms of the correlative mutual information objective. These alternatives intrinsically lead to forward and backward prediction networks without weight symmetry issues, providing a compelling solution to this long-standing challenge",

In this paper, we provide a framework for designing and analysing general U-Net architectures. We present theoretical results which characterise the role of the encoder and decoder in a U-Net, their high-resolution scaling limits and their conjugacy to ResNets via preconditioning. We propose Multi-ResNets, U-Nets with a simplified, wavelet-based encoder without learnable parameters. Further, we show how to design novel U-Net architectures which encode function constraints, natural bases, or the geometry of the data. In diffusion models, our framework enables us to identify that high-frequency information is dominated by noise exponentially faster, and show how U-Nets with average pooling exploit this. In our experiments, we demonstrate how Multi-ResNets achieve competitive and often superior performance compared to classical U-Nets in image segmentation, PDE surrogate modelling, and generative modelling with diffusion models. Our U-Net framework paves the way to study the theoretical properties of U-Nets and design natural, scalable neural architectures for a multitude of problems beyond the square",

Combining the worst occupation measure with a robust Q-value estimation yields an explicit form of the robust gradient.

    "abstract": "Discovering achievements with a hierarchical structure in procedurally generated environments presents a significant challenge. This requires an agent to possess a broad range of abilities, including generalization and long-term reasoning. Many prior methods have been built upon model-based or hierarchical approaches, with the belief that an explicit module for long-term planning would be advantageous for learning hierarchical dependencies. However, these methods demand an excessive number of environment interactions or large model sizes, limiting their practicality. In this work, we demonstrate that proximal policy optimization (PPO), a simple yet versatile model-free algorithm, outperforms previous methods when optimized with recent implementation practices. Moreover, we find that the PPO agent can predict the next achievement to be unlocked to some extent, albeit with limited confidence. Based on this observation, we introduce a novel contrastive learning method, called achievement distillation, which strengthens the agent's ability to predict the next achievement.

    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "The widespread deployment of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) sparks significant interest in their explainability, which plays a vital role in model auditing and ensuring trustworthy graph learning. The objective of GNN explainability is to discern the underlying graph structures that have the most significant impact on model predictions. Ensuring that explanations generated are reliable necessitates consideration of the in-distribution property, particularly due to the vulnerability of GNNs to out-of-distribution data. Unfortunately, prevailing explainability methods tend to constrain the generated explanations to the structure of the original graph, thereby downplaying the significance of the in-distribution property and resulting in explanations that lack reliability. To address these challenges, we propose D4Explainer, a novel approach that provides in-distribution GNN explanations for both counterfactual and model-level explanation scenarios. The proposed D4Explainer incorporates generative graph distribution learning into the optimization objective, which accomplishes two goals: 1) generate a collection of diverse counterfactual graphs that conform to the in-distribution property for a given instance, and 2) identify the most discriminative graph patterns that contribute to a specific class prediction, thus serving as model-level explanations. It is worth mentioning that D4Explainer is the first unified framework that combines both counterfactual and model-level explanations. Empirical evaluations conducted on synthetic and real-world datasets provide compelling evidence of the state-of-the-art performance achieved by D4Explainer in terms of explanation accuracy, faithfulness, diversity, and robustness",

Without explicitly estimating the drift, the algorithm learns a family of functions with almost the same error as a learning algorithm that knows the magnitude of the drift in advance.

    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "Policy evaluation via Monte Carlo (MC) simulation is at the core of many MC Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms (e.g., policy gradient methods). In this context, the designer of the learning system specifies an interaction budget that the agent usually spends by collecting trajectories of *fixed length* within a simulator. However, is this data collection strategy the best option? To answer this question, in this paper, we consider as quality index the variance of an unbiased policy return estimator that uses trajectories of different lengths, i.e., *truncated*. We first derive a closed-form expression of this variance that clearly shows the sub-optimality of the fixed-length trajectory schedule. Furthermore, it suggests that adaptive data collection strategies that spend the available budget sequentially might be able to allocate a larger portion of transitions in timesteps in which more accurate sampling is required to reduce the variance of the final estimate. Building on these findings, we present an *adaptive* algorithm called **R**obust and **I**terative **D**ata collection strategy **O**ptimization (RIDO). The main intuition behind RIDO is to split the available interaction budget into mini-batches. At each round, the agent determines the most convenient schedule of trajectories that minimizes an empirical and robust estimate of the estimator's variance. After discussing the theoretical properties of our method, we conclude by assessing its performance across multiple domains. Our results show that RIDO can adapt its trajectory schedule toward timesteps where more sampling is required to increase the quality of the final estimation",

In real-world scenarios, the underlying mechanisms of generating future interactions in dynamic systems are typically governed by a set of recurring substructures within the graph, known as temporal motifs. Despite the success and prevalence of current temporal graph neural networks (TGNN), it remains uncertain which temporal motifs are recognized as the significant indications that trigger a certain prediction from the model, which is a critical challenge for advancing the explainability and trustworthiness of current TGNNs. To address this challenge, we propose a novel approach, called **Temp**oral **M**otifs **E**xplainer (**TempME**), which uncovers the most pivotal temporal motifs guiding the prediction of TGNNs. Derived from the information bottleneck principle, TempME extracts the most interaction-related motifs while minimizing the amount of contained information to preserve the sparsity and succinctness of the explanation. Events in the explanations generated by TempME are verified to be more spatiotemporally correlated than those of existing approaches, providing more understandable insights.

To reduce the gap and improve the performance, current methods often resort to complicated training schemes, loss functions, and feature alignments, which are task-specific and feature-specific. In this paper, we state that the essence of these methods is to discard the noisy information and distill the valuable information in the feature, and propose a novel KD method dubbed DiffKD, to explicitly denoise and match features using diffusion models. Our approach is based on the observation that student features typically contain more noises than teacher features due to the smaller capacity of student model. To address this, we propose to denoise student features using a diffusion model trained by teacher features. This allows us to perform better distillation between the refined clean feature and teacher feature. Additionally, we introduce a light-weight diffusion model with a linear autoencoder to reduce the computation cost and an adaptive noise matching module to improve the denoising performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DiffKD is effective across various types of features and achieves state-of-the-art performance consistently on image classification, object detection, and semantic segmentation tasks.

Two types of covariate shift problems are the focus of this paper and the sharp convergence rates are established for a general loss function to provide a unified theoretical analysis, which concurs with the optimal results in literature where the squared loss is used.

To solve this problem, we first formulate the expected risk for this problem and then derive the Bayes optimal solution, which shows that the optimal model should reject to make predictions on the examples whose variance is larger than the rejection cost when the mean squared error is used as the evaluation metric. Furthermore, we propose to train the model by a surrogate loss function that considers rejection as binary classification and we provide conditions for the model consistency, which implies that the Bayes optimal solution can be recovered by our proposed surrogate loss.

To address this issue, we propose a generic GNN applicable to both homophilous and heterophilous graphs, namely Low-Rank Graph Neural Network (LRGNN). Our analysis demonstrates that a signed graph's global label relationship matrix has a low rank. This insight inspires us to predict the label relationship matrix by solving a robust low-rank matrix approximation problem, as prior research has proven that low-rank approximation could achieve perfect recovery under certain conditions.

    "abstract": "Learning continuous-time point processes is essential to many discrete event forecasting tasks. However, integration poses a major challenge, particularly for spatiotemporal point processes (STPPs), as it involves calculating the likelihood through triple integrals over space and time. Existing methods for integrating STPP either assume a parametric form of the intensity function, which lacks flexibility; or approximating the intensity with Monte Carlo sampling, which introduces numerical errors. Recent work by Omi et al. proposes a dual network approach for efficient integration of flexible intensity function. However, their method only focuses on the 1D temporal point process. In this paper, we introduce a novel paradigm: `Auto-STPP` (Automatic Integration for Spatiotemporal Neural Point Processes) that extends the dual network approach to 3D STPP. While previous work provides a foundation, its direct extension overly restricts the intensity function and leads to computational challenges. In response, we introduce a decomposable parametrization for the integral network using ProdNet. This approach, leveraging the product of simplified univariate graphs, effectively sidesteps the computational complexities inherent in multivariate computational graphs. We prove the consistency of `Auto-STPP` and validate it on synthetic data and benchmark real-world datasets. `Auto-STPP` shows a significant advantage in recovering complex intensity functions from irregular spatiotemporal events, particularly when the intensity is sharply localized.

    "abstract": "Existing score-distilling text-to-3D generation techniques, despite their considerable promise, often encounter the view inconsistency problem. One of the most notable issues is the Janus problem, where the most canonical view of an object (\\textit{e.g}., face or head) appears in other views. In this work, we explore existing frameworks for score-distilling text-to-3D generation and identify the main causes of the view inconsistency problem---the embedded bias of 2D diffusion models. Based on these findings, we propose two approaches to debias the score-distillation frameworks for view-consistent text-to-3D generation. Our first approach, called score debiasing, involves cutting off the score estimated by 2D diffusion models and gradually increasing the truncation value throughout the optimization process. Our second approach, called prompt debiasing, identifies conflicting words between user prompts and view prompts using a language model, and adjusts the discrepancy between view prompts and the viewing direction of an object. Our experimental results show that our methods improve the realism of the generated 3D objects by significantly reducing artifacts and achieve a good trade-off between faithfulness to the 2D diffusion models and 3D consistency with little overhead.

Randomized smoothing is a powerful framework for making models provably robust against small changes to their inputs - by guaranteeing robustness of the majority vote when randomly adding noise before classification. Yet, certifying robustness on such complex data via randomized smoothing is challenging when adversaries do not arbitrarily perturb entire objects (e.g. images) but only a subset of their entities (e.g. pixels). As a solution, we introduce hierarchical randomized smoothing: We partially smooth objects by adding random noise only on a randomly selected subset of their entities. By adding noise in a more targeted manner than existing methods we obtain stronger robustness guarantees while maintaining high accuracy. We initialize hierarchical smoothing using different noising distributions, yielding novel robustness certificates for discrete and continuous domains. We experimentally demonstrate the importance of hierarchical smoothing in image and node classification, where it yields superior robustness-accuracy trade-offs.

To circumvent this problem, the surrogate method employs a differentiable approximation of the Heaviside function in the backward pass, while the forward pass continues to use the Heaviside as the spiking function. We propose to use the zeroth-order technique at the local or neuron level in training SNNs, motivated by its regularizing and potential energy-efficient effects and establish a theoretical connection between it and the existing surrogate methods.

We prove its local convergence and analyze the sample complexity of our R-D estimator based on a connection to entropic optimal transport. Experimentally, we obtain comparable or tighter bounds than state-of-the-art neural network methods on low-rate sources while requiring considerably less tuning and computation effort. We also highlight a connection to maximum-likelihood deconvolution and introduce a new class of sources that can be used as test cases with known solutions to the R-D problem",

    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "Language models of code (LMs) work well when the surrounding code provides sufficient context. This is not true when it becomes necessary to use types, functionality or APIs defined elsewhere in the repository or a linked library, especially those not seen during training. LMs suffer from limited awareness of such global context and end up hallucinating. Integrated development environments (IDEs) assist developers in understanding repository context using static analysis. We extend this assistance, enjoyed by developers, to LMs. We propose monitor-guided decoding (MGD) where a monitor uses static analysis to guide the decoding. We construct a repository-level dataset PragmaticCode for method-completion in Java and evaluate MGD on it. On models of varying parameter scale, by monitoring for type-consistent object dereferences, MGD consistently improves compilation rates and agreement with ground truth. Further, LMs with fewer parameters, when augmented with MGD, can outperform larger LMs. With MGD, SantaCoder-1.1B achieves better compilation rate and next-identifier match than the much larger text-davinci-003 model. We also conduct a generalizability study to evaluate the ability of MGD to generalize to multiple programming languages (Java, C# and Rust), coding scenarios (e.g., correct number of arguments to method calls), and to enforce richer semantic constraints (e.g., stateful API protocols).

However, current data characterization methods are largely focused on classification settings, with regression settings largely understudied. To address this, we introduce TRIAGE, a novel data characterization framework tailored to regression tasks and compatible with a broad class of regressors. TRIAGE utilizes conformal predictive distributions to provide a model-agnostic scoring method, the TRIAGE score. We operationalize the score to analyze individual samples' training dynamics and characterize samples as under-, over-, or well-estimated by the model. We show that TRIAGE's characterization is consistent and highlight its utility to improve performance via data sculpting/filtering, in multiple regression settings. Additionally, beyond sample level, we show TRIAGE enables new approaches to dataset selection and feature acquisition. Overall, TRIAGE highlights the value unlocked by data characterization in real-world regression applications",

    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "Fairness and robustness are two important goals in the design of modern distributed learning systems. Despite a few prior works attempting to achieve both fairness and robustness, some key aspects of this direction remain underexplored. In this paper, we try to answer three largely unnoticed and unaddressed questions that are of paramount significance to this topic: (i) What makes jointly satisfying fairness and robustness difficult? (ii) Is it possible to establish theoretical guarantee for the dual property of fairness and robustness? (iii) How much does fairness have to sacrifice at the expense of robustness being incorporated into the system? To address these questions, we first identify data heterogeneity as the key difficulty of combining fairness and robustness. Accordingly, we propose a fair and robust framework called H-nobs which can offer certified fairness and robustness through the adoption of two key components, a fairness-promoting objective function and a simple robust aggregation scheme called norm-based screening (NBS). We explain in detail why NBS is the suitable scheme in our algorithm in contrast to other robust aggregation measures. In addition, we derive three convergence theorems for H-nobs in cases of the learning model being nonconvex, convex, and strongly convex respectively, which provide theoretical guarantees for both fairness and robustness. Further, we empirically investigate the influence of the robust mechanism (NBS) on the fairness performance of H-nobs, the very first attempt of such exploration",

Incorporating higher order many-body interactions can enhance the expressiveness and accuracy of models. Recent models have achieved this by explicitly including up to four-body interactions. However, five-body interactions, which have relevance in various fields, are still challenging to incorporate efficiently into MLFFs. In this work, we propose the quintuple network (QuinNet), an end-to-end graph neural network that efficiently expresses many-body interactions up to five-body interactions with \\emph{ab initio} accuracy. By analyzing the topology of diverse many-body interactions, we design the model architecture to efficiently and explicitly represent these interactions. We evaluate QuinNet on public datasets of small molecules, such as MD17 and its revised version, and show that it is compatible with other state-of-the-art models on these benchmarks. Moreover, QuinNet surpasses many leading models on larger and more complex molecular systems, such as MD22 and Chignolin, without increasing the computational complexity. We also use QuinNet as a force field for molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to demonstrate its accuracy and stability, and conduct an ablation study to elucidate the significance of five-body interactions.

    "abstract": "Gradual Domain Adaptation (GDA), in which the learner is provided with additional intermediate domains, has been theoretically and empirically studied in many contexts. Despite its vital role in security-critical scenarios, the adversarial robustness of the GDA model remains unexplored. In this paper, we adopt the effective gradual self-training method and replace vanilla self-training with adversarial self-training (AST). AST first predicts labels on the unlabeled data and then adversarially trains the model on the pseudo-labeled distribution. Intriguingly, we find that gradual AST improves not only adversarial accuracy but also clean accuracy on the target domain. We reveal that this is because adversarial training (AT) performs better than standard training when the pseudo-labels contain a portion of incorrect labels. Accordingly, we first present the generalization error bounds for gradual AST in a multiclass classification setting. We then use the optimal value of the Subset Sum Problem to bridge the standard error on a real distribution and the adversarial error on a pseudo-labeled distribution. The result indicates that AT may obtain a tighter bound than standard training on data with incorrect pseudo-labels. We further present an example of a conditional Gaussian distribution to provide more insights into why gradual AST can improve the clean accuracy for GDA",

To achieve this goal, we provide a generative diffusion-based framework called MomentDiff, which simulates a typical human retrieval process from random browsing to gradual localization. Specifically, we first diffuse the real span to random noise, and learn to denoise the random noise to the original span with the guidance of similarity between text and video. This allows the model to learn a mapping from arbitrary random locations to real moments, enabling the ability to locate segments from random initialization. Once trained, MomentDiff could sample random temporal segments as initial guesses and iteratively refine them to generate an accurate temporal boundary. Different from discriminative works (e.g., based on learnable proposals or queries), MomentDiff with random initialized spans could resist the temporal location biases from datasets. To evaluate the influence of the temporal location biases, we propose two ``anti-bias'' datasets with location distribution shifts, named Charades-STA-Len and Charades-STA-Mom. The experimental results demonstrate that our efficient framework consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods on three public benchmarks, and exhibits better generalization and robustness on the proposed anti-bias datasets.

Recent advancements in deep learning have shown promise in addressing this challenge, with sampling-based and regression-based methods emerging as two prominent approaches. However, these methods have notable limitations. Sampling-based methods often suffer from low efficiency due to the need for generating multiple candidate structures for selection. On the other hand, regression-based methods offer fast predictions but may experience decreased accuracy. Additionally, the variation in protein sizes often requires external modules for selecting suitable binding pockets, further impacting efficiency. In this work, we propose FABind, an end-to-end model that combines pocket prediction and docking to achieve accurate and fast protein-ligand binding. FABind incorporates a unique ligand-informed pocket prediction module, which is also leveraged for docking pose estimation. The model further enhances the docking process by incrementally integrating the predicted pocket to optimize protein-ligand binding, reducing discrepancies between training and inference.

The former provides precise inferences, but inferring via concrete rules is not scalable. The latter enables efficient reasoning at the cost of ambiguous inference accuracy. Neuro-symbolic reasoning seeks to amalgamate the advantages of both techniques. The crux of this approach is replacing the predicted existence of all possible triples (i.e., truth scores inferred from rules) with a suitable approximation grounded in embedding representations. However, constructing an effective approximation of all possible triples' truth scores is a challenging task, because it needs to balance the tradeoff between accuracy and efficiency, while compatible with both the rule-based and KG-embedding models. To this end, we proposed a differentiable framework - DiffLogic. Instead of directly approximating all possible triples, we design a tailored filter to adaptively select essential triples based on the dynamic rules and weights. The truth scores assessed by KG-embedding are continuous, so we employ a continuous Markov logic network named probabilistic soft logic (PSL). It employs the truth scores of essential triples to assess the overall agreement among rules, weights, and observed triples. PSL enables end-to-end differentiable optimization, so we can alternately update embedding and weighted rules.

Experimental data has indicated that the representations of ordinal information and contents of temporal sequences are disentangled in the brain, but the neural mechanism underlying this disentanglement remains largely unclear. Here, we investigate how recurrent neural circuits learn to represent the abstract order structure of temporal sequences, and how this disentangled representation of order structure from that of contents facilitates the processing of temporal sequences. We show that with an appropriate learn protocol, a recurrent neural circuit can learn a set of tree-structured attractor states to encode the corresponding tree-structured orders of given temporal sequences. This abstract temporal order template can then be bound with different contents, allowing for flexible and robust temporal sequence processing. Using a transfer learning task, we demonstrate that the reuse of a temporal order template facilitates the acquisition of new temporal sequences of the same or similar ordinal structure. Using a key-word spotting task, we demonstrate that the attractor representation of order structure improves the robustness of temporal sequence discrimination, if the ordinal information is the key to differentiate different sequences. We hope this study gives us insights into the neural mechanism of representing the ordinal information of temporal sequences in the brain, and helps us to develop brain-inspired temporal sequence processing algorithms",

Existing methods predominantly rely on self-supervised contrastive learning of audio-visual correspondence. Without any bounding-box annotations, they struggle to achieve precise localization, especially for small objects, and suffer from blurry boundaries and false positives. Moreover, the naive semi-supervised method is poor in effectively utilizing the abundance of unlabeled audio-visual pairs. In this paper, we propose a novel Semi-Supervised Learning framework for AVSL, namely Dual Mean-Teacher (DMT), comprising two teacher-student structures to circumvent the confirmation bias issue. Specifically, two teachers, pre-trained on limited labeled data, are employed to filter out noisy samples via the consensus between their predictions, and then generate high-quality pseudo-labels by intersecting their confidence maps.

    "abstract": "GNN explanation method aims to identify an explanatory subgraph which contains the most informative components of the full graph. However, a major limitation of existing GNN explainers is that they are not robust to the structurally corrupted graphs, e.g., graphs with noisy or adversarial edges. On the one hand, existing GNN explainers mostly explore explanations based on either the raw graph features or the learned latent representations, both of which can be easily corrupted. On the other hand, the corruptions in graphs are irregular in terms of the structural properties, e.g., the size or connectivity of graphs, which makes the rigorous constraints used by previous GNN explainers unfeasible. To address these issues, we propose a robust GNN explainer called V-InfoR. Specifically, a robust graph representation extractor, which takes insights of variational inference, is proposed to infer the latent distribution of graph representations. Instead of directly using the corrupted raw features or representations of each single graph, we sample the graph representations from the inferred distribution for the downstream explanation generator, which can effectively eliminate the minor corruption. We next formulate the explanation exploration as a graph information bottleneck (GIB) optimization problem. As a more general method that does not need any rigorous structural constraints, our GIB-based method can adaptively capture both the regularity and irregularity of the severely corrupted graphs for explanation. Extensive evaluations on both synthetic and real-world datasets indicate that V-InfoR significantly improves the GNN explanation performance for the structurally corrupted graphs.

Considering that the detection performance highly relies on the quality of the latent features, we design a VAE-based prototype learning scheme, named prototypical VAE (P-VAE), to learn a probabilistic latent space for enhancing the diversity and distinctiveness of the sampled features. The network encodes a multi-center GMM-like posterior, in which each distribution centers at a prototype. For regularization, P-VAE incorporates a reconstruction task to preserve geometric information. To adopt P-VAE for the detection framework, we formulate Geometric-informative Prototypical VAE (GP-VAE) to handle varying geometric components and Class-specific Prototypical VAE (CP-VAE) to handle varying object categories. In the first stage, we harness GP-VAE to aid feature extraction from the input scene. In the second stage, we cluster the geometric-informative features into per-instance features and use CP-VAE to refine each instance feature with category-level guidance. Experimental results show the top performance of our approach over the state of the arts on two FS3D benchmarks. Quantitative ablations and qualitative prototype analysis further demonstrate that our probabilistic modeling can significantly boost prototype learning for FS3D",

We adopt an information-theoretical viewpoint and start from the instance-specific lower bound of the number of samples that have to be collected to identify a nearly-optimal policy. Deriving this lower bound along with the optimal exploration strategy entails solving an intricate optimization problem and requires a model of the system. In turn, most existing sample optimal exploration algorithms rely on estimating the model. We derive an approximation of the instance-specific lower bound that only involves quantities that can be inferred using model-free approaches. Leveraging this approximation, we devise an ensemble-based model-free exploration strategy applicable to both tabular and continuous Markov decision processes. Numerical results demonstrate that our strategy is able to identify efficient policies faster than state-of-the-art exploration approaches",

    "abstract": "Policy Mirror Descent (PMD) is a general family of algorithms that covers a wide range of novel and fundamental methods in reinforcement learning. Motivated by the instability of policy iteration (PI) with inexact policy evaluation, unregularised PMD algorithmically regularises the policy improvement step of PI without regularising the objective function. With exact policy evaluation, PI is known to converge linearly with a rate given by the discount factor $\\gamma$ of a Markov Decision Process. In this work, we bridge the gap between PI and PMD with exact policy evaluation and show that the dimension-free $\\gamma$-rate of PI can be achieved by the general family of unregularised PMD algorithms under an adaptive step-size. We show that both the rate and step-size are unimprovable for PMD: we provide matching lower bounds that demonstrate that the $\\gamma$-rate is optimal for PMD methods as well as PI and that the adaptive step-size is necessary to achieve it. Our work is the first to relate PMD to rate-optimality and step-size necessity. Our study of the convergence of PMD avoids the use of the performance difference lemma, which leads to a direct analysis of independent interest. We also extend the analysis to the inexact setting and establish the first dimension-optimal sample complexity for unregularised PMD under a generative model, improving upon the best-known result",

However, current interpretable GNNs mostly are dataset-specific and hard to generalize to different graphs. A more generalizable GNN interpretation model which can effectively distill the universal structural patterns of different graphs is until-now unexplored. Motivated by the great success of recent pre-training techniques, we for the first time propose the Pre-training Interpretable Graph Neural Network ($\\pi$-GNN) to distill the universal interpretability of GNNs by pre-training over synthetic graphs with ground-truth explanations. Specifically, we introduce a structural pattern learning module to extract diverse universal structure patterns and integrate them together to comprehensively represent the graphs of different types. Next, a hypergraph refining module is proposed to identify the explanatory subgraph by incorporating the universal structure patterns with local edge interactions. Finally, the task-specific predictor is cascaded with the pre-trained $\\pi$-GNN model and fine-tuned over downstream tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that $\\pi$-GNN significantly surpasses the leading interpretable GNN baselines with up to 9.98\\% interpretation improvement and 16.06\\% classification accuracy improvement. Meanwhile, $\\pi$-GNN pre-trained on graph classification task also achieves the top-tier interpretation performance on node classification task, which further verifies its promising generalization performance among different downstream tasks.

    "abstract": "Model-free reinforcement learning algorithms have exhibited great potential in solving single-task sequential decision-making problems with high-dimensional observations and long horizons, but are known to be hard to generalize across tasks. Model-based RL, on the other hand, learns task-agnostic models of the world that naturally enables transfer across different reward functions, but struggles to scale to complex environments due to the compounding error. To get the best of both worlds, we propose a self-supervised reinforcement learning method that enables the transfer of behaviors across tasks with different rewards, while circumventing the challenges of model-based RL. In particular, we show self-supervised pre-training of model-free reinforcement learning with a number of random features as rewards allows implicit modeling of long-horizon environment dynamics. Then, planning techniques like model-predictive control using these implicit models enable fast adaptation to problems with new reward functions. Our method is self-supervised in that it can be trained on offline datasets without reward labels, but can then be quickly deployed on new tasks. We validate that our proposed method enables transfer across tasks on a variety of manipulation and locomotion domains in simulation, opening the door to generalist decision-making agents",

This problem is very timely and has many applications, including the key tasks of removing biases (RB), resolving confusion (RC) (caused by mislabelled data in trained models), as well as allowing users to exercise their 'right to be forgotten' to protect User Privacy (UP). This paper is the first, to our knowledge, to study unlearning for different applications (RB, RC, UP), with the view that each has its own desiderata, definitions for 'forgetting' and associated metrics for forget quality. For UP, we propose a novel adaptation of a strong Membership Inference Attack for unlearning. We also propose SCRUB, a novel unlearning algorithm, which is the only method that is consistently a top performer for forget quality across the different application-dependent metrics for RB, RC, and UP. At the same time, SCRUB is also consistently a top performer on metrics that measure model utility (i.e. accuracy on retained data and generalization), and is more efficient than previous work.

Implicit neural representations (INRs) have recently emerged as a promising approach to surface reconstruction. However, the reconstruction quality of existing methods relies on ground truth implicit function values or surface normal vectors. In this paper, we show that proper supervision of partial differential equations and fundamental properties of differential vector fields are sufficient to robustly reconstruct high-quality surfaces. We cast the $p$-Poisson equation to learn a signed distance function (SDF) and the reconstructed surface is implicitly represented by the zero-level set of the SDF. For efficient training, we develop a variable splitting structure by introducing a gradient of the SDF as an auxiliary variable and impose the $p$-Poisson equation directly on the auxiliary variable as a hard constraint. Based on the curl-free property of the gradient field, we impose a curl-free constraint on the auxiliary variable, which leads to a more faithful reconstruction. Experiments on standard benchmark datasets show that the proposed INR provides a superior and robust reconstruction. The code is available at https://github.com/Yebbi/PINC",

Drawing inspiration from existing Laplacians in the literature, we develop two unique formulations of sheaf hypergraph Laplacians: linear and non-linear. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates that incorporating sheaves into the hypergraph Laplacian provides a more expressive inductive bias than standard hypergraph diffusion, creating a powerful instrument for effectively modelling complex data structures. We employ these sheaf hypergraph Laplacians to design two categories of models: Sheaf Hypergraph Neural Networks and Sheaf Hypergraph Convolutional Networks. These models generalize classical Hypergraph Networks often found in the literature. Through extensive experimentation, we show that this generalization significantly improves performance, achieving top results on multiple benchmark datasets for hypergraph node classification",

A major challenge in ACRL is to ensure agent taking a valid action satisfying constraints in each RL step. Commonly used approach of using a projection layer on top of the policy network requires solving an optimization program which can result in longer training time, slow convergence, and zero gradient problem. To address this, first we use a normalizing flow model to learn an invertible, differentiable mapping between the feasible action space and the support of a simple distribution on a latent variable, such as Gaussian. Second, learning the flow model requires sampling from the feasible action space, which is also challenging. We develop multiple methods, based on Hamiltonian Monte-Carlo and probabilistic sentential decision diagrams for such action sampling for convex and non-convex constraints. Third, we integrate the learned normalizing flow with the DDPG algorithm. By design, a well-trained normalizing flow will transform policy output into a valid action without requiring an optimization solver.

Deep-learning-based Variational Monte Carlo (DL-VMC) has recently outperformed conventional approaches in terms of accuracy, but only at large computational cost.

Applying this model to new molecules without any optimization, yields wavefunctions and absolute energies that outperform established methods such as CCSD(T)-2Z.

    "abstract": "Learning representations on large-sized graphs is a long-standing challenge due to the inter-dependence nature involved in massive data points. Transformers, as an emerging class of foundation encoders for graph-structured data, have shown promising performance on small graphs due to its global attention capable of capturing all-pair influence beyond neighboring nodes. Even so, existing approaches tend to inherit the spirit of Transformers in language and vision tasks, and embrace complicated models by stacking deep multi-head attentions. In this paper, we critically demonstrate that even using a one-layer attention can bring up surprisingly competitive performance across node property prediction benchmarks where node numbers range from thousand-level to billion-level. This encourages us to rethink the design philosophy for Transformers on large graphs, where the global attention is a computation overhead hindering the scalability. We frame the proposed scheme as Simplified Graph Transformers (SGFormer), which is empowered by a simple attention model that can efficiently propagate information among arbitrary nodes in one layer. SGFormer requires none of positional encodings, feature/graph pre-processing or augmented loss. Empirically, SGFormer successfully scales to the web-scale graph ogbn-papers100M and yields up to 141x inference acceleration over SOTA Transformers on medium-sized graphs.

In physical systems, the interaction term can be singular, i.e. it diverges when two particles collide. Notable examples of such interactions include the Coulomb interaction, fundamental in plasma physics, and the Biot-Savart interaction, present in the vorticity formulation of the 2D Navier-Stokes equation (NSE) in fluid dynamics. Solving MVEs that involve singular interaction kernels presents a significant challenge, especially when aiming to provide rigorous theoretical guarantees. In this work, we propose a novel approach based on the concept of entropy dissipation in the underlying system. We derive a potential function that effectively controls the KL divergence between a hypothesis solution and the ground truth. Building upon this theoretical foundation, we introduce the Entropy-dissipation Informed Neural Network (EINN) framework for solving MVEs. In EINN, we utilize neural networks (NN) to approximate the underlying velocity field and minimize the proposed potential function. By leveraging the expressive power of NNs, our approach offers a promising avenue for tackling the complexities associated with singular interactions.

Motivated by the success of Transform- ers, we study the covariance matrix of a modified Softmax-based attention model with skip connections in the proportional limit of infinite-depth-and-width. We show that at initialization the limiting distribution can be described by a stochastic differential equation (SDE) indexed by the depth-to-width ratio. To achieve a well-defined stochastic limit, the Transformer's attention mechanism is modified by centering the Softmax output at identity, and scaling the Softmax logits by a width-dependent temperature parameter. We examine the stability of the network through the corresponding SDE, showing how the scale of both the drift and diffu- sion can be elegantly controlled with the aid of residual connections. The existence of a stable SDE implies that the covariance structure is well-behaved, even for very large depth and width, thus preventing the notorious issues of rank degeneracy in deep attention models.

    "abstract": "Meta-reinforcement learning (Meta-RL), though enabling a fast adaptation to learn new skills by exploiting the common structure shared among different tasks, suffers performance degradation in the sparse-reward setting. Current hindsight-based sample transfer approaches can alleviate this issue by transferring relabeled trajectories from other tasks to a new task so as to provide informative experience for the target reward function, but are unfortunately constrained with the unrealistic assumption that tasks differ only in reward functions. In this paper, we propose a doubly robust augmented transfer (DRaT) approach, aiming at addressing the more general sparse reward meta-RL scenario with both dynamics mismatches and varying reward functions across tasks. Specifically, we design a doubly robust augmented estimator for efficient value-function evaluation, which tackles dynamics mismatches with the optimal importance weight of transition distributions achieved by minimizing the theoretically derived upper bound of mean squared error (MSE) between the estimated values of transferred samples and their true values in the target task. Due to its intractability, we then propose an interval-based approximation to this optimal importance weight, which is guaranteed to cover the optimum with a constrained and sample-independent upper bound on the MSE approximation error. Based on our theoretical findings, we finally develop a DRaT algorithm for transferring informative samples across tasks during the training of meta-RL. We implement DRaT on an off-policy meta-RL baseline, and empirically show that it significantly outperforms other hindsight-based approaches on various sparse-reward MuJoCo locomotion tasks with varying dynamics and reward functions",

One natural approach is to rely on online learning algorithms that treat different models as experts. Existing methods, however, scale poorly ($\\mathrm{poly}M$) with the number of models $M$ in terms of their regret. Our key insight is that, for model selection in linear bandits, we can emulate full-information feedback to the online learner with a favorable bias-variance trade-off. This allows us to develop ALEXP, which has an exponentially improved ($\\log M$) dependence on $M$ for its regret. ALEXP has anytime guarantees on its regret, and neither requires knowledge of the horizon $n$, nor relies on an initial purely exploratory stage.

    "title": "(Provable) Adversarial Robustness for Group Equivariant Tasks: Graphs, Point Clouds, Molecules, and More",
    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "A machine learning model is traditionally considered robust if its prediction remains (almost) constant under input perturbations with small norm. However, real-world tasks like molecular property prediction or point cloud segmentation have inherent equivariances, such as rotation or permutation equivariance. In such tasks, even perturbations with large norm do not necessarily change an input's semantic content. Furthermore, there are perturbations for which a model's prediction explicitly needs to change. For the first time, we propose a sound notion of adversarial robustness that accounts for task equivariance. We then demonstrate that provable robustness can be achieved by (1) choosing a model that matches the task's equivariances (2) certifying traditional adversarial robustness. Certification methods are, however, unavailable for many models, such as those with continuous equivariances. We close this gap by developing the framework of equivariance-preserving randomized smoothing, which enables architecture-agnostic certification. We additionally derive the first architecture-specific graph edit distance certificates, i.e. sound robustness guarantees for isomorphism equivariant tasks like node classification. Overall, a sound notion of robustness is an important prerequisite for future work at the intersection of robust and geometric machine learning",

    "abstract": "Model pre-training is essential in human-centric perception. In this paper, we first introduce masked image modeling (MIM) as a pre-training approach for this task. Upon revisiting the MIM training strategy, we reveal that human structure priors offer significant potential. Motivated by this insight, we further incorporate an intuitive human structure prior - human parts - into pre-training. Specifically, we employ this prior to guide the mask sampling process. Image patches, corresponding to human part regions, have high priority to be masked out. This encourages the model to concentrate more on body structure information during pre-training, yielding substantial benefits across a range of human-centric perception tasks. To further capture human characteristics, we propose a structure-invariant alignment loss that enforces different masked views, guided by the human part prior, to be closely aligned for the same image. We term the entire method as HAP. HAP simply uses a plain ViT as the encoder yet establishes new state-of-the-art performance on 11 human-centric benchmarks, and on-par result on one dataset. For example, HAP achieves 78.1% mAP on MSMT17 for person re-identification, 86.54% mA on PA-100K for pedestrian attribute recognition, 78.2% AP on MS COCO for 2D pose estimation, and 56.0 PA-MPJPE on 3DPW for 3D pose and shape estimation",

Moreover, modern neural networks have been found to be poorly calibrated and make overconfident predictions regardless of inherent sample difficulty and data uncertainty. To address this issue, we propose to utilize large-scale pre-trained models to guide downstream model training with sample difficulty-aware entropy regularization. Pre-trained models that have been exposed to large-scale datasets and do not overfit the downstream training classes enable us to measure each training sample's difficulty via feature-space Gaussian modeling and relative Mahalanobis distance computation. Importantly, by adaptively penalizing overconfident prediction based on the sample difficulty, we simultaneously improve accuracy and uncertainty calibration across challenging benchmarks (e.g., +0.55% ACC and −3.7% ECE on ImageNet1k using ResNet34), consistently surpassing competitive baselines for reliable prediction. The improved uncertainty estimate further improves selective classification (abstaining from erroneous predictions) and out-of-distribution detection",

    "abstract": "Meta-learning has demonstrated promising results in few-shot classification (FSC) by learning to solve new problems using prior knowledge. Bayesian methods are effective at characterizing uncertainty in FSC, which is crucial in high-risk fields. In this context, the logistic-softmax likelihood is often employed as an alternative to the softmax likelihood in multi-class Gaussian process classification due to its conditional conjugacy property. However, the theoretical property of logistic-softmax is not clear and previous research indicated that the inherent uncertainty of logistic-softmax leads to suboptimal performance. To mitigate these issues, we revisit and redesign the logistic-softmax likelihood, which enables control of the \\textit{a priori} confidence level through a temperature parameter. Furthermore, we theoretically and empirically show that softmax can be viewed as a special case of logistic-softmax and logistic-softmax induces a larger family of data distribution than softmax. Utilizing modified logistic-softmax, we integrate the data augmentation technique into the deep kernel based Gaussian process meta-learning framework, and derive an analytical mean-field approximation for task-specific updates.

In this paper, we propose a novel multi-hop graph attention mechanism, named Subtree Attention (STA), to address the aforementioned issues. STA seamlessly bridges the fully-attentional structure and the rooted subtree, with theoretical proof that STA approximates the global attention under extreme settings. By allowing direct computation of attention weights among multi-hop neighbors, STA mitigates the inherent problems in existing graph attention mechanisms. Further we devise an efficient form for STA by employing kernelized softmax, which yields a linear time complexity. Our resulting GNN architecture, the STAGNN, presents a simple yet performant STA-based graph neural network leveraging a hop-aware attention strategy. Comprehensive evaluations on ten node classification datasets demonstrate that STA-based models outperform existing graph transformers and mainstream GNNs.

    "abstract": "Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) of pre-trained language models (PLMs) has emerged as a highly successful approach, with training only a small number of parameters without sacrificing performance and becoming the de-facto learning paradigm with the increasing size of PLMs. However, existing PEFT methods are not memory-efficient, because they still require caching most of the intermediate activations for the gradient calculation, akin to fine-tuning. One effective way to reduce the activation memory is to apply a reversible model, so the intermediate activations are not necessary to be cached and can be recomputed. Nevertheless, modifying a PLM to its reversible variant is not straightforward, since the reversible model has a distinct architecture from the currently released PLMs. In this paper, we first investigate what is a key factor for the success of existing PEFT methods, and realize that it's essential to preserve the PLM's starting point when initializing a PEFT method. With this finding, we propose memory-efficient fine-tuning (MEFT) that inserts adapters into a PLM, preserving the PLM's starting point and making it reversible without additional pre-training. We evaluate MEFT on the GLUE benchmark and five question-answering tasks with various backbones, BERT, RoBERTa, BART and OPT. MEFT significantly reduces the activation memory up to 84% of full fine-tuning with a negligible amount of trainable parameters. Moreover, MEFT achieves the same score on GLUE and a comparable score on the question-answering tasks as full fine-tuning. A similar finding is also observed for the image classification task",

Thus, leading approaches often implement additional search strategies, from stochastic sampling and beam-search to explicit fine-tuning. In this paper, we argue for the benefits of learning a population of complementary policies, which can be simultaneously rolled out at inference. To this end, we introduce Poppy, a simple training procedure for populations. Instead of relying on a predefined or hand-crafted notion of diversity, Poppy induces an unsupervised specialization targeted solely at maximizing the performance of the population.

    "abstract": "Recent advances in large vision-language models have revolutionized the image classification paradigm. Despite showing impressive zero-shot capabilities, a pre-defined set of categories, a.k.a. the vocabulary, is assumed at test time for composing the textual prompts. However, such assumption can be impractical when the semantic context is unknown and evolving. We thus formalize a novel task, termed as Vocabulary-free Image Classification (VIC), where we aim to assign to an input image a class that resides in an unconstrained language-induced semantic space, without the prerequisite of a known vocabulary. VIC is a challenging task as the semantic space is extremely large, containing millions of concepts, with hard-to-discriminate fine-grained categories. In this work, we first empirically verify that representing this semantic space by means of an external vision-language database is the most effective way to obtain semantically relevant content for classifying the image. We then propose Category Search from External Databases (CaSED), a method that exploits a pre-trained vision-language model and an external vision-language database to address VIC in a training-free manner. CaSED first extracts a set of candidate categories from captions retrieved from the database based on their semantic similarity to the image, and then assigns to the image the best matching candidate category according to the same vision-language model. Experiments on benchmark datasets validate that CaSED outperforms other complex vision-language frameworks, while being efficient with much fewer parameters, paving the way for future research in this direction",

Abiding by the tradition in deep learning, DMs are trained and evaluated on the images with fixed sizes. However, users are demanding for various images with specific sizes and various aspect ratio. This paper focuses on adapting text-to-image diffusion models to handle such variety while maintaining visual fidelity. First we observe that, during the synthesis, lower resolution images suffer from incomplete object portrayal, while higher resolution images exhibit repetitively disordered presentation. Next, we establish a statistical relationship indicating that attention entropy changes with token quantity, suggesting that models aggregate spatial information in proportion to image resolution. The subsequent interpretation on our observations is that objects are incompletely depicted due to limited spatial information for low resolutions, while repetitively disorganized presentation arises from redundant spatial information for high resolutions. From this perspective, we propose a scaling factor to alleviate the change of attention entropy and mitigate the defective pattern observed. Extensive experimental results validate the efficacy of the proposed scaling factor, enabling models to achieve better visual effects, image quality, and text alignment.

While off-the-shelf PaI methods manage to find trainable subnetworks that outperform random pruning, their performance in terms of both accuracy and computational reduction is far from satisfactory compared to post-training pruning and the understanding of PaI is missing. For instance, recent studies show that existing PaI methods only able to find good layerwise sparsities not weights, as the discovered subnetworks are surprisingly resilient against layerwise random mask shuffling and weight re-initialization. In this paper, we study PaI from a brand-new perspective -- the topology of subnetworks. In particular, we propose a principled framework for analyzing the performance of Pruning and Initialization (PaI) methods with two quantities, namely, the number of effective paths and effective nodes. These quantities allow for a more comprehensive understanding of PaI methods, giving us an accurate assessment of different subnetworks at initialization. We systematically analyze the behavior of various PaI methods through our framework and observe a guiding principle for constructing effective subnetworks: *at a specific sparsity, the top-performing subnetwork always presents a good balance between the number of effective nodes and the number of effective paths.* Inspired by this observation, we present a novel data-agnostic pruning method by solving a multi-objective optimization problem. By conducting extensive experiments across different architectures and datasets, our results demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art PaI methods while it is able to discover subnetworks that have much lower inference FLOPs (up to 3.4$\\times$).

    "abstract": "As concerns about data privacy continue to grow, differential privacy (DP) has emerged as a fundamental concept that aims to guarantee privacy by ensuring individuals' indistinguishability in data analysis. Local differential privacy (LDP) is a rigorous type of DP that requires individual data to be privatized before being sent to the collector, thus removing the need for a trusted third party to collect data. Among the numerous (L)DP-based approaches, functional DP has gained considerable attention in the DP community because it connects DP to statistical decision-making by formulating it as a hypothesis-testing problem and also exhibits Gaussian-related properties. However, the utility of privatized data is generally lower than that of non-private data, prompting research into optimal mechanisms that maximize the statistical utility for given privacy constraints. In this study, we investigate how functional LDP preserves the statistical utility by analyzing minimax risks of univariate mean estimation as well as nonparametric density estimation. We leverage the contraction property of functional LDP mechanisms and classical information-theoretical bounds to derive private minimax lower bounds. Our theoretical study reveals that it is possible to establish an interpretable, continuous balance between the statistical utility and privacy level, which has not been achieved under the $\\epsilon$-LDP framework. Furthermore, we suggest minimax optimal mechanisms based on Gaussian LDP (a type of functional LDP) that achieve the minimax upper bounds and show via a numerical study that they are superior to the counterparts derived under $\\epsilon$-LDP. The theoretical and empirical findings of this work suggest that Gaussian LDP should be considered a reliable standard for LDP",

    "abstract": "Parallelization techniques have become ubiquitous for accelerating inference and training of deep neural networks. Despite this, several operations are still performed in a sequential manner. For instance, the forward and backward passes are executed layer-by-layer, and the output of diffusion models is produced by applying a sequence of denoising steps. This sequential approach results in a computational cost proportional to the number of steps involved, presenting a potential bottleneck as the number of steps increases. In this work, we introduce DeepPCR, a novel algorithm which parallelizes typically sequential operations in order to speed up inference and training of neural networks. DeepPCR is based on interpreting a sequence of $L$ steps as the solution of a specific system of equations, which we recover using the Parallel Cyclic Reduction algorithm. This reduces the complexity of computing the sequential operations from $\\mathcal{O}(L)$ to $\\mathcal{O}(\\log_2L)$, thus yielding a speedup for large $L$. To verify the theoretical lower complexity of the algorithm, and to identify regimes for speedup, we test the effectiveness of DeepPCR in parallelizing the forward and backward pass in multi-layer perceptrons, and reach speedups of up to $30\\times$ for the forward and $200\\times$ for the backward pass.

    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "Recent progress in large language models (LLMs) has demonstrated the ability to learn and leverage Internet-scale knowledge through pre-training with autoregressive models. Unfortunately, applying such models to settings with embodied agents, such as robots, is challenging due to their lack of experience with the physical world, inability to parse non-language observations, and ignorance of rewards or safety constraints that robots may require. On the other hand, language-conditioned robotic policies that learn from interaction data can provide the necessary grounding that allows the agent to be correctly situated in the real world, but such policies are limited by the lack of high-level semantic understanding due to the limited breadth of the interaction data available for training them. Thus, if we want to make use of the semantic knowledge in a language model while still situating it in an embodied setting, we must construct an action sequence that is both likely according to the language model and also realizable according to grounded models of the environment. We frame this as a problem similar to probabilistic filtering: decode a sequence that both has high probability under the language model and high probability under a set of grounded model objectives. We demonstrate how such grounded models can be obtained across three simulation and real-world domains, and that the proposed decoding strategy is able to solve complex, long-horizon embodiment tasks in a robotic setting by leveraging the knowledge of both models",

    "abstract": "Driven by significant improvements in architectural design and training pipelines, computer vision has recently experienced dramatic progress in terms of accuracy on classic benchmarks such as ImageNet. These highly-accurate models are challenging to deploy, as they appear harder to compress using standard techniques such as pruning. We address this issue by introducing the Correlation Aware Pruner (CAP), a new unstructured pruning framework which significantly pushes the compressibility limits for state-of-the-art architectures. Our method is based on two technical advancements: a new theoretically-justified pruner, which can handle complex weight correlations accurately and efficiently during the pruning process itself, and an efficient finetuning procedure for post-compression recovery. We validate our approach via extensive experiments on several modern vision models such as Vision Transformers (ViT), modern CNNs, and ViT-CNN hybrids, showing for the first time that these can be pruned to high sparsity levels (e.g. $\\geq 75$%) with low impact on accuracy ($\\leq 1$% relative drop). Our approach is also compatible with structured pruning and quantization, and can lead to practical speedups of 1.5 to 2.4x without accuracy loss. To further showcase CAP's accuracy and scalability, we use it to show for the first time that extremely-accurate large vision models, trained via self-supervised techniques, can also be pruned to moderate sparsities, with negligible accuracy loss",

    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "Ensembles of machine learning models have been well established as a powerful method of improving performance over a single model. Traditionally, ensembling algorithms train their base learners independently or sequentially with the goal of optimizing their joint performance. In the case of deep ensembles of neural networks, we are provided with the opportunity to directly optimize the true objective: the joint performance of the ensemble as a whole. Surprisingly, however, directly minimizing the loss of the ensemble appears to rarely be applied in practice. Instead, most previous research trains individual models independently with ensembling performed _post hoc_. In this work, we show that this is for good reason - _joint optimization of ensemble loss results in degenerate behavior_. We approach this problem by decomposing the ensemble objective into the strength of the base learners and the diversity between them. We discover that joint optimization results in a phenomenon in which base learners collude to artificially inflate their apparent diversity. This pseudo-diversity fails to generalize beyond the training data, causing a larger generalization gap. We proceed to comprehensively demonstrate the practical implications of this effect on a range of standard machine learning tasks and architectures by smoothly interpolating between independent training and joint optimization",

As a quantum analog of probability distribution learning, quantum state learning is theoretically and practically essential in quantum machine learning. In this paper, we develop a no-go theorem for learning an unknown quantum state with QNNs even starting from a high-fidelity initial state. We prove that when the loss value is lower than a critical threshold, the probability of avoiding local minima vanishes exponentially with the qubit count, while only grows polynomially with the circuit depth. The curvature of local minima is concentrated to the quantum Fisher information times a loss-dependent constant, which characterizes the sensibility of the output state with respect to parameters in QNNs. These results hold for any circuit structures, initialization strategies, and work for both fixed ansatzes and adaptive methods. Extensive numerical simulations are performed to validate our theoretical results.

    "abstract": "In the quest for unveiling novel categories at test time, we confront the inherent limitations of traditional supervised recognition models that are restricted by a predefined category set. While strides have been made in the realms of self-supervised and open-world learning towards test-time category discovery, a crucial yet often overlooked question persists: what exactly delineates a category? In this paper, we conceptualize a category through the lens of optimization, viewing it as an optimal solution to a well-defined problem. Harnessing this unique conceptualization, we propose a novel, efficient and self-supervised method capable of discovering previously unknown categories at test time. A salient feature of our approach is the assignment of minimum length category codes to individual data instances, which encapsulates the implicit category hierarchy prevalent in real-world datasets. This mechanism affords us enhanced control over category granularity, thereby equipping our model to handle fine-grained categories adeptly. Experimental evaluations, bolstered by state-of-the-art benchmark comparisons, testify to the efficacy of our solution in managing unknown categories at test time. Furthermore, we fortify our proposition with a theoretical foundation, providing proof of its optimality. Our code is available at: https://github.com/SarahRastegar/InfoSieve",

    "abstract": "Training on large-scale datasets can boost the performance of video instance segmentation while the annotated datasets for VIS are hard to scale up due to the high labor cost. What we possess are numerous isolated filed-specific datasets, thus, it is appealing to jointly train models across the aggregation of datasets to enhance data volume and diversity. However, due to the heterogeneity in category space, as mask precision increase with the data volume, simply utilizing multiple datasets will dilute the attention of models on different taxonomy. Thus, increasing the data scale and enriching taxonomy space while improving classification precision is important. In this work, we analyze that providing extra taxonomy information can help models concentrate on specific taxonomy, and propose our model named Taxonomy-aware Multi-dataset Joint Training for Video Instance Segmentation (TMT-VIS) to address this vital challenge. Specifically, we design a two-stage taxonomy aggregation module that first compiles taxonomy information from input videos and then aggregates these taxonomy priors into instance queries before the transformer decoder. We conduct extensive experimental evaluations on four popular and challenging benchmarks, including YouTube-VIS 2019, YouTube-VIS 2021, OVIS, and UVO. Our model shows significant improvement over the baseline solutions, and sets new state-of-the-art records on all these benchmarks.

Existing analyses relate this notion to the graph isomorphism problem, which is mostly relevant for graphs of small sizes, or studied graph classification or regression tasks, while prediction tasks on \\emph{nodes} are far more relevant on large graphs. Recently, several works showed that, on very general random graphs models, GNNs converge to certains functions as the number of nodes grows. In this paper, we provide a more complete and intuitive description of the function space generated by equivariant GNNs for node-tasks, through general notions of convergence that encompass several previous examples. We emphasize the role of input node features, and study the impact of \\emph{node Positional Encodings} (PEs), a recent line of work that has been shown to yield state-of-the-art results in practice. Through the study of several examples of PEs on large random graphs, we extend previously known universality results to significantly more general models.

    "title": "A Scale-Invariant Sorting Criterion to Find a Causal Order in Additive Noise Models",
    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "Additive Noise Models (ANMs) are a common model class for causal discovery from observational data. Due to a lack of real-world data for which an underlying ANM is known, ANMs with randomly sampled parameters are commonly used to simulate data for the evaluation of causal discovery algorithms. While some parameters may be fixed by explicit assumptions, fully specifying an ANM requires choosing all parameters. Reisach et al. (2021) show that, for many ANM parameter choices, sorting the variables by increasing variance yields an ordering close to a causal order and introduce ‘var-sortability' to quantify this alignment. Since increasing variances may be unrealistic and cannot be exploited when data scales are arbitrary, ANM data are often rescaled to unit variance in causal discovery benchmarking. We show that synthetic ANM data are characterized by another pattern that is scale-invariant and thus persists even after standardization: the explainable fraction of a variable's variance, as captured by the coefficient of determination $R^2$, tends to increase along the causal order. The result is high ‘$R^2$-sortability', meaning that sorting the variables by increasing $R^2$ yields an ordering close to a causal order. We propose a computationally efficient baseline algorithm termed ‘$R^2$-SortnRegress' that exploits high $R^2$-sortability and that can match and exceed the performance of established causal discovery algorithms. We show analytically that sufficiently high edge weights lead to a relative decrease of the noise contributions along causal chains, resulting in increasingly deterministic relationships and high $R^2$. We characterize $R^2$-sortability on synthetic data with different simulation parameters and find high values in common settings. Our findings reveal high $R^2$-sortability as an assumption about the data generating process relevant to causal discovery and implicit in many ANM sampling schemes. It should be made explicit, as its prevalence in real-world data is an open question. For causal discovery benchmarking, we provide implementations of $R^2$-sortability, the $R^2$-SortnRegress algorithm, and ANM simulation procedures in our library CausalDisco at https://causaldisco.github.io/CausalDisco/",

    "title": "Learning Invariant Representations of Graph Neural Networks via Cluster Generalization",
    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "Graph neural networks (GNNs) have become increasingly popular in modeling graph-structured data due to their ability to learn node representations by aggregating local structure information. However, it is widely acknowledged that the test graph structure may differ from the training graph structure, resulting in a structure shift. In this paper, we experimentally find that the performance of GNNs drops significantly when the structure shift happens, suggesting that the learned models may be biased towards specific structure patterns. To address this challenge, we propose the Cluster Information Transfer (\\textbf{CIT}) mechanism, which can learn invariant representations for GNNs, thereby improving their generalization ability to various and unknown test graphs with structure shift. The CIT mechanism achieves this by combining different cluster information with the nodes while preserving their cluster-independent information. By generating nodes across different clusters, the mechanism significantly enhances the diversity of the nodes and helps GNNs learn the invariant representations. We provide a theoretical analysis of the CIT mechanism, showing that the impact of changing clusters during structure shift can be mitigated after transfer. Additionally, the proposed mechanism is a plug-in that can be easily used to improve existing GNNs. We comprehensively evaluate our proposed method on three typical structure shift scenarios, demonstrating its effectiveness in enhancing GNNs' performance",

This fact raises the question of whether or not computational intractability can be circumvented if one focuses on specific classes of Markov games. One such example is two-player zero-sum Markov games, in which efficient ways to compute a Nash equilibrium are known. Inspired by zero-sum polymatrix normal-form games (Cai et al., 2016), we define a class of zero-sum multi-agent Markov games in which there are only pairwise interactions described by a graph that changes per state. For this class of Markov games, we show that an $\\epsilon$-approximate Nash equilibrium can be found efficiently. To do so, we generalize the techniques of (Cai et al., 2016), by showing that the set of coarse-correlated equilibria collapses to the set of Nash equilibria. Afterwards, it is possible to use any algorithm in the literature that computes approximate coarse-correlated equilibria Markovian policies to get an approximate Nash equilibrium",

    "abstract": "Test-time adaptation (TTA) aims to address distributional shifts between training and testing data using only unlabeled test data streams for continual model adaptation. However, most TTA methods assume benign test streams, while test samples could be unexpectedly diverse in the wild. For instance, an unseen object or noise could appear in autonomous driving. This leads to a new threat to existing TTA algorithms; we found that prior TTA algorithms suffer from those noisy test samples as they blindly adapt to incoming samples. To address this problem, we present Screening-out Test-Time Adaptation (SoTTA), a novel TTA algorithm that is robust to noisy samples. The key enabler of SoTTA is two-fold: (i) input-wise robustness via high-confidence uniform-class sampling that effectively filters out the impact of noisy samples and (ii) parameter-wise robustness via entropy-sharpness minimization that improves the robustness of model parameters against large gradients from noisy samples. Our evaluation with standard TTA benchmarks with various noisy scenarios shows that our method outperforms state-of-the-art TTA methods under the presence of noisy samples and achieves comparable accuracy to those methods without noisy samples.

To include frequently encountered sparse graphs such as bounded-degree or power law graphs, we take a perspective of taking limits of operators derived from graphs, such as the aggregation operation that makes up GNNs. This leads to the recently introduced limit notion of graphops (Backhausz and Szegedy, 2022). We demonstrate how the operator perspective allows us to develop quantitative bounds on the distance between a finite GNN and its limit on an infinite graph, as well as the distance between the GNN on graphs of different sizes that share structural properties, under a regularity assumption verified for various graph sequences.

    "abstract": "Neural radiance field (NeRF) enables the synthesis of cutting-edge realistic novel view images of a 3D scene. It includes density and color fields to model the shape and radiance of a scene, respectively. Supervised by the photometric loss in an end-to-end training manner, NeRF inherently suffers from the shape-radiance ambiguity problem, i.e., it can perfectly fit training views but does not guarantee decoupling the two fields correctly. To deal with this issue, existing works have incorporated prior knowledge to provide an independent supervision signal for the density field, including total variation loss, sparsity loss, distortion loss, etc. These losses are based on general assumptions about the density field, e.g., it should be smooth, sparse, or compact, which are not adaptive to a specific scene. In this paper, we propose a more adaptive method to reduce the shape-radiance ambiguity. The key is a rendering method that is only based on the density field. Specifically, we first estimate the color field based on the density field and posed images in a closed form. Then NeRF's rendering process can proceed. We address the problems in estimating the color field, including occlusion and non-uniformly distributed views. Afterward, it is applied to regularize NeRF's density field. As our regularization is guided by photometric loss, it is more adaptive compared to existing ones. Experimental results show that our method improves the density field of NeRF both qualitatively and quantitatively. Our code is available at https://github.com/qihangGH/Closed-form-color-field",

To mitigate the negative impact of noise from soft triples, we propose a new formalism for rules to be learnt, named \\emph{text enhanced rules} or \\emph{TE-rules} for short. To effectively learn TE-rules, we propose a neural model that simulates the inference of TE-rules. We theoretically show that any set of TE-rules can always be interpreted by a certain parameter assignment of the neural model. We introduce three new datasets to evaluate the effectiveness of our method. Experimental results demonstrate that the introduction of soft triples and TE-rules results in significant performance improvements in inductive link prediction",

    "abstract": "Existing 3D instance segmentation methods typically assume that all semantic classes to be segmented would be available during training and only seen categories are segmented at inference. We argue that such a closed-world assumption is restrictive and explore for the first time 3D indoor instance segmentation in an open-world setting, where the model is allowed to distinguish a set of known classes as well as identify an unknown object as unknown and then later incrementally learning the semantic category of the unknown when the corresponding category labels are available. To this end, we introduce an open-world 3D indoor instance segmentation method, where an auto-labeling scheme is employed to produce pseudo-labels during training and induce separation to separate known and unknown category labels. We further improve the pseudo-labels quality at inference by adjusting the unknown class probability based on the objectness score distribution. We also introduce carefully curated open-world splits leveraging realistic scenarios based on inherent object distribution, region-based indoor scene exploration and randomness aspect of open-world classes. Extensive experiments reveal the efficacy of the proposed contributions leading to promising open-world 3D instance segmentation performance.

    "abstract": "World models are a fundamental component in model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL). To perform temporally extended and consistent simulations of the future in partially observable environments, world models need to possess long-term memory. However, state-of-the-art MBRL agents, such as Dreamer, predominantly employ recurrent neural networks (RNNs) as their world model backbone, which have limited memory capacity. In this paper, we seek to explore alternative world model backbones for improving long-term memory. In particular, we investigate the effectiveness of Transformers and Structured State Space Sequence (S4) models, motivated by their remarkable ability to capture long-range dependencies in low-dimensional sequences and their complementary strengths. We propose S4WM, the first world model compatible with parallelizable SSMs including S4 and its variants. By incorporating latent variable modeling, S4WM can efficiently generate high-dimensional image sequences through latent imagination. Furthermore, we extensively compare RNN-, Transformer-, and S4-based world models across four sets of environments, which we have tailored to assess crucial memory capabilities of world models, including long-term imagination, context-dependent recall, reward prediction, and memory-based reasoning. Our findings demonstrate that S4WM outperforms Transformer-based world models in terms of long-term memory, while exhibiting greater efficiency during training and imagination. These results pave the way for the development of stronger MBRL agents",

    "abstract": "Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (NeuralODEs) present an attractive way to extract dynamical laws from time series data, as they bridge neural networks with the differential equation-based modeling paradigm of the physical sciences. However, these models often display long training times and suboptimal results, especially for longer duration data. While a common strategy in the literature imposes strong constraints to the NeuralODE architecture to inherently promote stable model dynamics, such methods are ill-suited for dynamics discovery as the unknown governing equation is not guaranteed to satisfy the assumed constraints. In this paper, we develop a new training method for NeuralODEs, based on synchronization and homotopy optimization, that does not require changes to the model architecture. We show that synchronizing the model dynamics and the training data tames the originally irregular loss landscape, which homotopy optimization can then leverage to enhance training. Through benchmark experiments, we demonstrate our method achieves competitive or better training loss while often requiring less than half the number of training epochs compared to other model-agnostic techniques.

Reinforcement Learning (RL) provides a versatile framework for designing heuristics across a broad spectrum of problem domains. However, despite notable progress, RL has not yet supplanted industrial solvers as the go-to solution. Current approaches emphasize pre-training heuristics that construct solutions, but often rely on search procedures with limited variance, such as stochastically sampling numerous solutions from a single policy, or employing computationally expensive fine-tuning of the policy on individual problem instances. Building on the intuition that performant search at inference time should be anticipated during pre-training, we propose COMPASS, a novel RL approach that parameterizes a distribution of diverse and specialized policies conditioned on a continuous latent space. We evaluate COMPASS across three canonical problems - Travelling Salesman, Capacitated Vehicle Routing, and Job-Shop Scheduling - and demonstrate that our search strategy (i) outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in 9 out of 11 standard benchmarking tasks and (ii) generalizes better, surpassing all other approaches on a set of 18 procedurally transformed instance distributions",

    "abstract": "Kernelized bandits, also known as Bayesian optimization (BO), has been a prevalent method for optimizing complicated black-box reward functions. Various BO algorithms have been theoretically shown to enjoy upper bounds on their cumulative regret which are sub-linear in the number $T$ of iterations, and a regret lower bound of $\\Omega(\\sqrt{T})$ has been derived which represents the unavoidable regrets for any classical BO algorithm. Recent works on quantum bandits have shown that with the aid of quantum computing, it is possible to achieve tighter regret upper bounds better than their corresponding classical lower bounds. However, these works are restricted to either multi-armed or linear bandits, and are hence not able to solve sophisticated real-world problems with non-linear reward functions. To this end, we introduce the quantum-Gaussian process-upper confidence bound (Q-GP-UCB) algorithm. To the best of our knowledge, our Q-GP-UCB is the first BO algorithm able to achieve a regret upper bound of $\\mathcal{O}(\\text{poly}\\log T)$, which is significantly smaller than its regret lower bound of $\\Omega(\\sqrt{T})$ in the classical setting. Moreover, thanks to our novel analysis of the confidence ellipsoid, our Q-GP-UCB with the linear kernel achieves a smaller regret than the quantum linear UCB algorithm from the previous work. We use simulations, as well as an experiment using a real quantum computer, to verify that the theoretical quantum speedup achieved by our Q-GP-UCB is also potentially relevant in practice",

    "abstract": "When domain knowledge is limited and experimentation is restricted by ethical, financial, or time constraints, practitioners turn to observational causal discovery methods to recover the causal structure, exploiting the statistical properties of their data. Because causal discovery without further assumptions is an ill-posed problem, each algorithm comes with its own set of usually untestable assumptions, some of which are hard to meet in real datasets. Motivated by these considerations, this paper extensively benchmarks the empirical performance of recent causal discovery methods on observational _iid_ data generated under different background conditions, allowing for violations of the critical assumptions required by each selected approach. Our experimental findings show that score matching-based methods demonstrate surprising performance in the false positive and false negative rate of the inferred graph in these challenging scenarios, and we provide theoretical insights into their performance. This work is also the first effort to benchmark the stability of causal discovery algorithms with respect to the values of their hyperparameters. Finally, we hope this paper will set a new standard for the evaluation of causal discovery methods and can serve as an accessible entry point for practitioners interested in the field, highlighting the empirical implications of different algorithm choices",

    "title": "Minimum Description Length and Generalization Guarantees for Representation Learning",
    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "A major challenge in designing efficient statistical supervised learning algorithms is finding representations that perform well not only on available training samples but also on unseen data. While the study of representation learning has spurred much interest, most existing such approaches are heuristic; and very little is known about theoretical generalization guarantees. For example, the information bottleneck method seeks a good generalization by finding a minimal description of the input that is maximally informative about the label variable, where minimality and informativeness are both measured by Shannon's mutual information. In this paper, we establish a compressibility framework that allows us to derive upper bounds on the generalization error of a representation learning algorithm in terms of the \"Minimum Description Length'' (MDL) of the labels or the latent variables (representations). Rather than the mutual information between the encoder's input and the representation, which is often believed to reflect the algorithm's generalization capability in the related literature but in fact, falls short of doing so, our new bounds involve the \"multi-letter\" relative entropy between the distribution of the representations (or labels) of the training and test sets and a fixed prior. In particular, these new bounds reflect the structure of the encoder and are not vacuous for deterministic algorithms. Our compressibility approach, which is information-theoretic in nature, builds upon that of Blum-Langford for PAC-MDL bounds and introduces two essential ingredients: block-coding and lossy-compression. The latter allows our approach to subsume the so-called geometrical compressibility as a special case. To the best knowledge of the authors, the established generalization bounds are the first of their kind for Information Bottleneck type encoders and representation learning. Finally, we partly exploit the theoretical results by introducing a new data-dependent prior. Numerical simulations illustrate the advantages of well-chosen such priors over classical priors used in IB",

    "abstract": "Graph convolutional networks (GCN) with one or two hidden layers have been widely used in handling graph data that are prevalent in various disciplines. Many studies showed that the gain of making GCNs deeper is tiny or even negative. This implies that the complexity of graph data is often limited and shallow models are often sufficient to extract expressive features for various tasks such as node classification. Therefore, in this work, we present a framework called graph convolutional kernel machine (GCKM) for graph-based machine learning. GCKMs are built upon kernel functions integrated with graph convolution. An example is the graph convolutional kernel support vector machine (GCKSVM) for node classification, for which we analyze the generalization error bound and discuss the impact of the graph structure. Compared to GCNs, GCKMs require much less effort in architecture design, hyperparameter tuning, and optimization. More importantly, GCKMs are guaranteed to obtain globally optimal solutions and have strong generalization ability and high interpretability. GCKMs are composable, can be extended to large-scale data, and are applicable to various tasks (e.g., node or graph classification, clustering, feature extraction, dimensionality reduction). The numerical results on benchmark datasets show that, besides the aforementioned advantages, GCKMs have at least competitive accuracy compared to GCNs",

    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "Along with recent diffusion models, randomized smoothing has become one of a few tangible approaches that offers adversarial robustness to models at scale, e.g., those of large pre-trained models. Specifically, one can perform randomized smoothing on any classifier via a simple \"denoise-and-classify\" pipeline, so-called denoised smoothing, given that an accurate denoiser is available - such as diffusion model. In this paper, we present scalable methods to address the current trade-off between certified robustness and accuracy in denoised smoothing. Our key idea is to \"selectively\" apply smoothing among multiple noise scales, coined multi-scale smoothing, which can be efficiently implemented with a single diffusion model. This approach also suggests a new objective to compare the collective robustness of multi-scale smoothed classifiers, and questions which representation of diffusion model would maximize the objective. To address this, we propose to further fine-tune diffusion model (a) to perform consistent denoising whenever the original image is recoverable, but (b) to generate rather diverse outputs otherwise. Our experiments show that the proposed multi-scale smoothing scheme, combined with diffusion fine-tuning, not only allows strong certified robustness at high noise scales but also maintains accuracy close to non-smoothed classifiers.

While recent deep neural networks have demonstrated sampling of realistic graphs together with diffusion models, however, they still suffer from oversmoothing problems which are inherited from conventional graph convolution and thus high-frequency characteristics of nodes and edges become intractable. To overcome such issues and generate graphs with high fidelity, this paper introduces a novel approach that captures the dependency between nodes and edges at multiple resolutions in the spectral space. By modeling the joint distribution of node and edge signals in a shared graph wavelet space, together with a score-based diffusion model, we propose a Wavelet Graph Diffusion Model (Wave-GD) which lets us sample synthetic graphs with real-like frequency characteristics of nodes and edges. Experimental results on four representative benchmark datasets validate the superiority of the Wave-GD over existing approaches, highlighting its potential for a wide range of applications that involve graph data",

Given a fixed total budget, this naturally induces a trade-off between evaluating more unique conditions while replicating each of them fewer times vs. evaluating fewer unique conditions and replicating each more times. Moreover, in these problems, practitioners may be risk-averse and hence prefer an input with both good average performance and small variability. To tackle both challenges, we propose the Batch Thompson Sampling for Replicable Experimental Design (BTS-RED) framework, which encompasses three algorithms. Our BTS-RED-Known and BTS-RED-Unknown algorithms, for, respectively, known and unknown noise variance, choose the number of replications adaptively rather than deterministically such that an input with a larger noise variance is replicated more times. As a result, despite the noise heteroscedasticity, both algorithms enjoy a theoretical guarantee and are asymptotically no-regret. Our Mean-Var-BTS-RED algorithm aims at risk-averse optimization and is also asymptotically no-regret.

    "abstract": "While multi-exit neural networks are regarded as a promising solution for making efficient inference via early exits, combating adversarial attacks remains a challenging problem. In multi-exit networks, due to the high dependency among different submodels, an adversarial example targeting a specific exit not only degrades the performance of the target exit but also reduces the performance of all other exits concurrently. This makes multi-exit networks highly vulnerable to simple adversarial attacks. In this paper, we propose NEO-KD, a knowledge-distillation-based adversarial training strategy that tackles this fundamental challenge based on two key contributions. NEO-KD first resorts to neighbor knowledge distillation to guide the output of the adversarial examples to tend to the ensemble outputs of neighbor exits of clean data. NEO-KD also employs exit-wise orthogonal knowledge distillation for reducing adversarial transferability across different submodels. The result is a significantly improved robustness against adversarial attacks.

    "title": "Intra-Modal Proxy Learning for Zero-Shot Visual Categorization with CLIP",
    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "Vision-language pre-training methods, e.g., CLIP, demonstrate an impressive zero-shot performance on visual categorizations with the class proxy from the text embedding of the class name. However, the modality gap between the text and vision space can result in a sub-optimal performance. We theoretically show that the gap cannot be reduced sufficiently by minimizing the contrastive loss in CLIP and the optimal proxy for vision tasks may reside only in the vision space. Therefore, given unlabeled target vision data, we propose to learn the vision proxy directly with the help from the text proxy for zero-shot transfer. Moreover, according to our theoretical analysis, strategies are developed to further refine the pseudo label obtained by the text proxy to facilitate the intra-modal proxy learning (InMaP) for vision. Experiments on extensive downstream tasks confirm the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposal. Concretely, InMaP can obtain the vision proxy within one minute on a single GPU while improving the zero-shot accuracy from $77.02\\%$ to $80.21\\%$ on ImageNet with ViT-L/14@336 pre-trained by CLIP",

    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "As hyper-parameters are ubiquitous and can significantly affect the model performance, hyper-parameter optimization is extremely important in machine learning. In this paper, we consider a sub-class of hyper-parameter optimization problems, where the hyper-gradients are not available. Such problems frequently appear when the performance metric is non-differentiable or the hyper-parameter is not continuous. However, existing algorithms, like Bayesian optimization and reinforcement learning, often get trapped in local optimals with poor performance. To address the above limitations, we propose to use cubic regularization to accelerate convergence and avoid saddle points. First, we adopt stochastic relaxation, which allows obtaining gradient and Hessian information without hyper-gradients. Then, we exploit the rich curvature information by cubic regularization. Theoretically, we prove that the proposed method can converge to approximate second-order stationary points, and the convergence is also guaranteed when the lower-level problem is inexactly solved. Experiments on synthetic and real-world data demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method",

    "abstract": "Recently, unsupervised adversarial training (AT) has been highlighted as a means of achieving robustness in models without any label information. Previous studies in unsupervised AT have mostly focused on implementing self-supervised learning (SSL) frameworks, which maximize the instance-wise classification loss to generate adversarial examples. However, we observe that simply maximizing the self-supervised training loss with an untargeted adversarial attack often results in generating ineffective adversaries that may not help improve the robustness of the trained model, especially for non-contrastive SSL frameworks without negative examples. To tackle this problem, we propose a novel positive mining for targeted adversarial attack to generate effective adversaries for adversarial SSL frameworks. Specifically, we introduce an algorithm that selects the most confusing yet similar target example for a given instance based on entropy and similarity, and subsequently perturbs the given instance towards the selected target. Our method demonstrates significant enhancements in robustness when applied to non-contrastive SSL frameworks, and less but consistent robustness improvements with contrastive SSL frameworks, on the benchmark datasets",

    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "Recent works have shown the promise of learning pre-trained models for 3D molecular representation. However, existing pre-training models focus predominantly on equilibrium data and largely overlook off-equilibrium conformations. It is challenging to extend these methods to off-equilibrium data because their training objective relies on assumptions of conformations being the local energy minima. We address this gap by proposing a force-centric pretraining model for 3D molecular conformations covering both equilibrium and off-equilibrium data. For off-equilibrium data, our model learns directly from their atomic forces. For equilibrium data, we introduce zero-force regularization and forced-based denoising techniques to approximate near-equilibrium forces. We obtain a unified pre-trained model for 3D molecular representation with over 15 million diverse conformations. Experiments show that, with our pre-training objective, we increase forces accuracy by around 3 times compared to the un-pre-trained Equivariant Transformer model. By incorporating regularizations on equilibrium data, we solved the problem of unstable MD simulations in vanilla Equivariant Transformers, achieving state-of-the-art simulation performance with 2.45 times faster inference time than NequIP. As a powerful molecular encoder, our pre-trained model achieves on-par performance with state-of-the-art property prediction tasks",

    "title": "Debiased and Denoised Entity Recognition from Distant Supervision",
    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "While distant supervision has been extensively explored and exploited in NLP tasks like named entity recognition, a major obstacle stems from the inevitable noisy distant labels tagged unsupervisedly. A few past works approach this problem by adopting a self-training framework with a sample-selection mechanism. In this work, we innovatively identify two types of biases that were omitted by prior work, and these biases lead to inferior performance of the distant-supervised NER setup. First, we characterize the noise concealed in the distant labels as highly structural rather than fully randomized. Second, the self-training framework would ubiquitously introduce an inherent bias that causes erroneous behavior in both sample selection and eventually prediction. To cope with these problems, we propose a novel self-training framework, dubbed DesERT. This framework augments the conventional NER predicative pathway to a dual form that effectively adapts the sample-selection process to conform to its innate distributional-bias structure. The other crucial component of DesERT composes a debiased module aiming to enhance the token representations, hence the quality of the pseudo-labels. Extensive experiments are conducted to validate the DesERT. The results show that our framework establishes a new state-of-art performance, it achieves a +2.22% average F1 score improvement on five standardized benchmarking datasets. Lastly, DesERT demonstrates its effectiveness under a new DSNER benchmark where additional distant supervision comes from the ChatGPT model",

    "abstract": "Offline Reinforcement Learning (RL) has demonstrated promising results in various applications by learning policies from previously collected datasets, reducing the need for online exploration and interactions. However, real-world scenarios usually involve partial observability, which brings crucial challenges of the deployment of offline RL methods: i) the policy trained on data with full observability is not robust against the masked observations during execution, and ii) the information of which parts of observations are masked is usually unknown during training. In order to address these challenges, we present Offline RL with DiscrEte pRoxy representations (ORDER), a probabilistic framework which leverages novel state representations to improve the robustness against diverse masked observabilities. Specifically, we propose a discrete representation of the states and use a proxy representation to recover the states from masked partial observable trajectories. The training of ORDER can be compactly described as the following three steps. i) Learning the discrete state representations on data with full observations, ii) Training the decision module based on the discrete representations, and iii) Training the proxy discrete representations on the data with various partial observations, aligning with the discrete representations. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate ORDER, showcasing its effectiveness in offline RL for diverse partially observable scenarios and highlighting the significance of discrete proxy representations in generalization performance. ORDER is a flexible framework to employ any offline RL algorithms and we hope that ORDER can pave the way for the deployment of RL policy against various partial observabilities in the real world",

Researchers found that variable order dramatically affects efficiency and proposed various heuristics. The existing learning-based methods are all supervised learning methods that cannot cope with diverse polynomial sets. This paper proposes two Reinforcement Learning (RL) approaches combined with Graph Neural Networks (GNN) for Suggesting Variable Order (SVO).

    "abstract": "Tensor decompositions (TDs) serve as a powerful tool for analyzing multiway data. Traditional TDs incorporate prior knowledge about the data into the model, such as a directed generative process from latent factors to observations. In practice, selecting proper structural or distributional assumptions beforehand is crucial for obtaining a promising TD representation. However, since such prior knowledge is typically unavailable in real-world applications, choosing an appropriate TD model can be challenging. This paper aims to address this issue by introducing a flexible TD framework that discards the structural and distributional assumptions, in order to learn as much information from the data. Specifically, we construct a TD model that captures the joint probability of the data and latent tensor factors through a deep energy-based model (EBM). Neural networks are then employed to parameterize the joint energy function of tensor factors and tensor entries. The flexibility of EBM and neural networks enables the learning of underlying structures and distributions. In addition, by designing the energy function, our model unifies the learning process of different types of tensors, such as static tensors and dynamic tensors with time stamps. The resulting model presents a doubly intractable nature due to the presence of latent tensor factors and the unnormalized probability function. To efficiently train the model, we derive a variational upper bound of the conditional noise-contrastive estimation objective that learns the unnormalized joint probability by distinguishing data from conditional noises. We show advantages of our model on both synthetic and several real-world datasets",

While prior discriminative particle filters have used heuristic relaxations of discrete particle resampling, or biased learning by truncating gradients at resampling steps, we achieve unbiased and low-variance gradient estimates by representing posteriors as continuous mixture densities. Our theory and experiments expose dramatic failures of existing reparameterization-based estimators for mixture gradients, an issue we address via an importance-sampling gradient estimator. Unlike standard recurrent neural networks, our mixture density particle filter represents multimodal uncertainty in continuous latent states, improving accuracy and robustness.

Empirical insights into MLPs are important for multiple reasons. (1) Given the recent narrative \"less inductive bias is better\", popularized due to transformers eclipsing convolutional models, it is natural to explore the limits of this hypothesis. To that end, MLPs offer an ideal test bed, as they lack any vision-specific inductive bias. (2) MLPs have almost exclusively been the main protagonist in the deep learning theory literature due to their mathematical simplicity, serving as a proxy to explain empirical phenomena observed for more complex architectures. Surprisingly, experimental datapoints for MLPs are very difficult to find in the literature, especially when coupled with large pre-training protocols. This discrepancy between practice and theory is worrying: \\textit{Do MLPs reflect the empirical advances exhibited by practical models?} Or do theorists need to rethink the role of MLPs as a proxy? We provide insights into both these aspects. We show that the performance of MLPs drastically improves with scale (95% on CIFAR10, 82% on CIFAR100, 58% on ImageNet ReaL), highlighting that lack of inductive bias can indeed be compensated. We observe that MLPs mimic the behaviour of their modern counterparts faithfully, with some components in the learning setting however exhibiting stronger or unexpected behaviours.

The prevalence of such undesirable memorization can pose issues for model trainers, and may even require discarding an otherwise functional model. We therefore seek to predict which sequences will be memorized before a large model's full train-time by extrapolating the memorization behavior of lower-compute trial runs. We measure memorization in the Pythia model suite and plot scaling laws for forecasting memorization, allowing us to provide equi-compute recommendations to maximize the reliability (recall) of such predictions.

A common example is school choice, where a matching mechanism uses student and school preferences to assign students to schools. In such settings, forming preferences is both difficult and critical. Prior work has suggested various prediction mechanisms that help agents make decisions about their preferences. Although often deployed together, these matching and prediction mechanisms are almost always analyzed separately. The present work shows that at the intersection of the two lies a previously unexplored type of strategic behavior: agents returning to the market (e.g., schools) can attack future predictions by interacting short-term non-optimally with their matches. Here, we first introduce this type of strategic behavior, which we call an adversarial interaction attack. Next, we construct a formal economic model that captures the feedback loop between prediction mechanisms designed to assist agents and the matching mechanism used to pair them. Finally, in a simplified setting, we prove that returning agents can benefit from using adversarial interaction attacks and gain progressively more as the trust in and accuracy of predictions increases. We also show that this attack increases inequality in the student population",

The LOOCV risk can suffer from multiple and bad local minima for finite $n$ and thus requires the specification of a set of candidate $\\lambda$, which can fail to provide good solutions. In contrast, we show that the proposed method is guaranteed to find a unique optimal solution for large enough $n$, under relatively mild conditions, without requiring the specification of any difficult to determine hyper-parameters. This is based on a Bayesian formulation of ridge regression that we prove to have a unimodal posterior for large enough $n$, allowing for both the optimal $\\lambda$ and the regression coefficients to be jointly learned within an iterative expectation maximization (EM) procedure. Importantly, we show that by utilizing an appropriate preprocessing step, a single iteration of the main EM loop can be implemented in $O(\\min(n, p))$ operations, for input data with $n$ rows and $p$ columns. In contrast, evaluating a single value of $\\lambda$ using fast LOOCV costs $O(n \\min(n, p))$ operations when using the same preprocessing.

In this work, inspired by the classic human reasoning test (namely Raven's Progressive Matrix), we propose the Reasoning Game, a cognition-oriented environment that encourages agents to reason and communicate high-level rules, rather than perceived low-level contexts. Moreover, we propose 1) an unbiased dataset (namely rule-RAVEN) as a benchmark to avoid overfitting, 2) and a two-stage curriculum agent training method as a baseline for more stable convergence in the Reasoning Game, where contexts and semantics are bilaterally drifting.

    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "Uncertainty quantification (UQ) is essential for creating trustworthy machine learning models. Recent years have seen a steep rise in UQ methods that can flag suspicious examples, however, it is often unclear what exactly these methods identify. In this work, we propose a framework for categorizing uncertain examples flagged by UQ methods. We introduce the confusion density matrix---a kernel-based approximation of the misclassification density---and use this to categorize suspicious examples identified by a given uncertainty method into three classes: out-of-distribution (OOD) examples, boundary (Bnd) examples, and examples in regions of high in-distribution misclassification (IDM). Through extensive experiments, we show that our framework provides a new and distinct perspective for assessing differences between uncertainty quantification methods, thereby forming a valuable assessment benchmark",

    "abstract": "The progress in hyperbolic neural networks (HNNs) research is hindered by their absence of inductive bias mechanisms, which are essential for generalizing to new tasks and facilitating scalable learning over large datasets. In this paper, we aim to alleviate these issues by learning generalizable inductive biases from the nodes' local subgraph and transfer them for faster learning over new subgraphs with a disjoint set of nodes, edges, and labels in a few-shot setting. We introduce a novel method, Hyperbolic GRAph Meta Learner (H-GRAM), that, for the tasks of node classification and link prediction, learns transferable information from a set of support local subgraphs in the form of hyperbolic meta gradients and label hyperbolic protonets to enable faster learning over a query set of new tasks dealing with disjoint subgraphs. Furthermore, we show that an extension of our meta-learning framework also mitigates the scalability challenges seen in HNNs faced by existing approaches. Our comparative analysis shows that H-GRAM effectively learns and transfers information in multiple challenging few-shot settings compared to other state-of-the-art baselines. Additionally, we demonstrate that, unlike standard HNNs, our approach is able to scale over large graph datasets and improve performance over its Euclidean counterparts",

    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "Deep learning methods have achieved state-of-the-art performance in most modeling tasks involving images, text and audio, however, they typically underperform tree-based methods on tabular data. In this paper, we hypothesize that a significant contributor to this performance gap is the interaction between irregular target functions resulting from the heterogeneous nature of tabular feature spaces, and the well-known tendency of neural networks to learn smooth functions. Utilizing tools from spectral analysis, we show that functions described by tabular datasets often have high irregularity, and that they can be smoothed by transformations such as scaling and ranking in order to improve performance. However, because these transformations tend to lose information or negatively impact the loss landscape during optimization, they need to be rigorously fine-tuned for each feature to achieve performance gains. To address these problems, we propose introducing frequency reduction as an inductive bias. We realize this bias as a neural network layer that promotes learning low-frequency representations of the input features, allowing the network to operate in a space where the target function is more regular. Our proposed method introduces less computational complexity than a fully connected layer, while significantly improving neural network performance, and speeding up its convergence on 14 tabular datasets",

On the theoretical side, we rigorously formulate fair PCA using a new notion called probably approximately fair and optimal (PAFO) learnability. On the practical side, motivated by recent advances in streaming algorithms for addressing memory limitation, we propose a new setting called fair streaming PCA along with a memory-efficient algorithm, fair noisy power method (FNPM). We then provide its statistical guarantee in terms of PAFO-learnability, which is the first of its kind in fair PCA literature. We verify our algorithm in the CelebA dataset without any pre-processing; while the existing approaches are inapplicable due to memory limitations, by turning it into a streaming setting, we show that our algorithm performs fair PCA efficiently and effectively",

However, existing 4-bit training methods require custom numerical formats which are not supported by contemporary hardware. In this work, we propose a training method for transformers with all matrix multiplications implemented with the INT4 arithmetic. Training with an ultra-low INT4 precision is challenging. To achieve this, we carefully analyze the specific structures of activation and gradients in transformers to propose dedicated quantizers for them. For forward propagation, we identify the challenge of outliers and propose a Hadamard quantizer to suppress the outliers. For backpropagation, we leverage the structural sparsity of gradients by proposing bit splitting and leverage score sampling techniques to quantize gradients accurately. Our algorithm achieves competitive accuracy on a wide range of tasks including natural language understanding, machine translation, and image classification. Unlike previous 4-bit training methods, our algorithm can be implemented on the current generation of GPUs.

They are gaining popularity due to their multi-sided benefits to users, sellers and platforms alike. However, existing causality-based recommendation methods require additional input in the form of exposure data and/or propensity scores (i.e., the probability of exposure) for training. Such data, crucial for modeling causality in recommendation, are often not available in real-world situations due to technical or privacy constraints. In this paper, we bridge the gap by proposing a new framework, called Propensity Estimation for Causality-based Recommendation (PropCare). It can estimate the propensity and exposure from a more practical setup, where only interaction data are available *without* any ground truth on exposure or propensity in training and inference. We demonstrate that, by relating the pairwise characteristics between propensity and item popularity, PropCare enables competitive causality-based recommendation given only the conventional interaction data. We further present a theoretical analysis on the bias of the causal effect under our model estimation. Finally, we empirically evaluate PropCare through both quantitative and qualitative experiments",

    "abstract": "The popularity of bi-level optimization (BO) in deep learning has spurred a growing interest in studying gradient-based BO algorithms. However, existing algorithms involve two coupled learning rates that can be affected by approximation errors when computing hypergradients, making careful fine-tuning necessary to ensure fast convergence. To alleviate this issue, we investigate the use of recently proposed adaptive step-size methods, namely stochastic line search (SLS) and stochastic Polyak step size (SPS), for computing both the upper and lower-level learning rates. First, we revisit the use of SLS and SPS in single-level optimization without the additional interpolation condition that is typically assumed in prior works. For such settings, we investigate new variants of SLS and SPS that improve upon existing suggestions in the literature and are simpler to implement. Importantly, these two variants can be seen as special instances of general family of methods with an envelope-type step-size. This unified envelope strategy allows for the extension of the algorithms and their convergence guarantees to BO settings. Finally, our extensive experiments demonstrate that the new algorithms, which are available in both SGD and Adam versions, can find large learning rates with minimal tuning and converge faster than corresponding vanilla SGD or Adam BO algorithms that require fine-tuning",

    "abstract": "Matrices are exceptionally useful in various fields of study as they provide a convenient framework to organize and manipulate data in a structured manner. However, modern matrices can involve billions of elements, making their storage and processing quite demanding in terms of computational resources and memory usage. Although prohibitively large, such matrices are often approximately low rank. We propose an algorithm that exploits this structure to obtain a low rank decomposition of any matrix $\\mathbf{A}$ as $\\mathbf{A} \\approx \\mathbf{L}\\mathbf{R}$, where $\\mathbf{L}$ and $\\mathbf{R}$ are the low rank factors. The total number of elements in $\\mathbf{L}$ and $\\mathbf{R}$ can be significantly less than that in $\\mathbf{A}$. Furthermore, the entries of $\\mathbf{L}$ and $\\mathbf{R}$ are quantized to low precision formats -- compressing $\\mathbf{A}$ by giving us a low rank and low precision factorization. Our algorithm first computes an approximate basis of the range space of $\\mathbf{A}$ by randomly sketching its columns, followed by a quantization of the vectors constituting this basis. It then computes approximate projections of the columns of $\\mathbf{A}$ onto this quantized basis. We derive upper bounds on the approximation error of our algorithm, and analyze the impact of target rank and quantization bit-budget. The tradeoff between compression ratio and approximation accuracy allows for flexibility in choosing these parameters based on specific application requirements. We empirically demonstrate the efficacy of our algorithm in image compression, nearest neighbor classification of image and text embeddings, and compressing the layers of LlaMa-$7$b. Our results illustrate that we can achieve compression ratios as aggressive as one bit per matrix coordinate, all while surpassing or maintaining the performance of traditional compression techniques",

In this paper, we initiate the study of a more challenging scenario --- continuous covariate shift --- in which the test data appear sequentially, and their distributions can shift continuously. Our goal is to adaptively train the predictor such that its prediction risk accumulated over time can be minimized. Starting with the importance-weighted learning, we theoretically show the method works effectively if the time-varying density ratios of test and train inputs can be accurately estimated. However, existing density ratio estimation methods would fail due to data scarcity at each time step. To this end, we propose an online density ratio estimation method that can appropriately reuse historical information. Our method is proven to perform well by enjoying a dynamic regret bound, which finally leads to an excess risk guarantee for the predictor. Empirical results also validate the effectiveness",

We present an approach for doing so by harnessing the power of large language models (LLMs).

The method produces both Python code for creating new features and explanations for the utility of the generated features. Despite being methodologically simple, CAAFE improves performance on 11 out of 14 datasets -- boosting mean ROC AUC performance from 0.798 to 0.822 across all dataset - similar to the improvement achieved by using a random forest instead of logistic regression on our datasets. Furthermore, CAAFE is interpretable by providing a textual explanation for each generated feature.

By introducing a novel regularization loss for Q-ensemble independence based on random matrix theory, we propose spiked Wishart Q-ensemble independence regularization (SPQR) for reinforcement learning.

To address this challenging problem, we propose a Self-Interpretable Graph aNomaly dETection model (SIGNET for short) that detects anomalous graphs as well as generates informative explanations simultaneously. Specifically, we first introduce the multi-view subgraph information bottleneck (MSIB) framework, serving as the design basis of our self-interpretable GLAD approach. This way SIGNET is able to not only measure the abnormality of each graph based on cross-view mutual information but also provide informative graph rationales by extracting bottleneck subgraphs from the input graph and its dual hypergraph in a self-supervised way.

Prevalent methods mainly mitigate this issue by aligning different treatment groups in the latent space, the core of which is the calculation of distribution discrepancy. However, two issues that are often overlooked can render these methods invalid: (1) mini-batch sampling effects (MSE), where the calculated discrepancy is erroneous in non-ideal mini-batches with outcome imbalance and outliers; (2) unobserved confounder effects (UCE), where the unobserved confounders are not considered in the discrepancy calculation. Both of these issues invalidate the calculated discrepancy, mislead the training of estimators, and thus impede the handling of treatment selection bias. To tackle these issues, we propose Entire Space CounterFactual Regression (ESCFR), which is a new take on optimal transport technology in the context of causality. Specifically, based on the canonical optimal transport framework, we propose a relaxed mass-preserving regularizer to address the MSE issue and design a proximal factual outcome regularizer to handle the UCE issue.

However, a key limitation is that these language models fundamentally lack grounding to visual perception - a crucial attribute needed to extend to real world tasks such as in visual-question answering and robotics. While prior works have largely connected image to text through pretraining or fine-tuning, learning such alignments are generally costly due to a combination of curating massive datasets and large computational burdens. In order to resolve these limitations, we propose a simple yet effective approach called Language-Quantized AutoEncoder (LQAE), a modification of VQ-VAE that learns to align text-image data in an unsupervised manner by leveraging pretrained language model denoisers (e.g., BERT). Our main idea is to encode images as sequences of text tokens by directly quantizing image embeddings using a pretrained language codebook. We then feed a masked version of the quantized embeddings into a BERT to reconstruct the original input. By doing so, LQAE learns to represent similar images with similar clusters of text tokens, thereby aligning these two modalities without the use of aligned text-image pairs. We show LQAE learns text-aligned image tokens that enable few-shot multi-modal learning with large language models, outperforming baseline methods in tasks such as image classification and VQA while requiring as few as 1-10 image-text pairs",

Concretely, we reframe the problem of offline safe RL using probabilistic inference, which introduces variational distributions to make the optimization of policies more flexible. Subsequently, we utilize pessimistic estimation methods to estimate the Q-value of cost and reward, which mitigates the extrapolation errors induced by OOD actions.

    "abstract": "We consider the problem of \\emph{blocked} collaborative bandits where there are multiple users, each with an associated multi-armed bandit problem. These users are grouped into \\emph{latent} clusters such that the mean reward vectors of users within the same cluster are identical. Our goal is to design algorithms that maximize the cumulative reward accrued by all the users over time, under the \\emph{constraint} that no arm of a user is pulled more than $\\mathsf{B}$ times. This problem has been originally considered by \\cite{Bresler:2014}, and designing regret-optimal algorithms for it has since remained an open problem. In this work, we propose an algorithm called B-LATTICE (Blocked Latent bAndiTs via maTrIx ComplEtion) that collaborates across users, while simultaneously satisfying the budget constraints, to maximize their cumulative rewards. Theoretically, under certain reasonable assumptions on the latent structure, with $\\mathsf{M}$ users, $\\mathsf{N}$ arms, $\\mathsf{T}$ rounds per user, and $\\mathsf{C}=O(1)$ latent clusters, B-LATTICE achieves a per-user regret of $\\widetilde{O}(\\sqrt{\\mathsf{T}(1 + \\mathsf{N}\\mathsf{M}^{-1})})$ under a budget constraint of $\\mathsf{B}=\\Theta(\\log \\mathsf{T})$. These are the first sub-linear regret bounds for this problem, and match the minimax regret bounds when $\\mathsf{B}=\\mathsf{T}$. Empirically, we demonstrate that our algorithm has superior performance over baselines even when $\\mathsf{B}=1$. B-LATTICE is a phased algorithm where in each phase it clusters users into groups and collaborates across users within a group to quickly learn their reward models",

    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "A Bayesian pseudocoreset is a compact synthetic dataset summarizing essential information of a large-scale dataset and thus can be used as a proxy dataset for scalable Bayesian inference. Typically, a Bayesian pseudocoreset is constructed by minimizing a divergence measure between the posterior conditioning on the pseudocoreset and the posterior conditioning on the full dataset. However, evaluating the divergence can be challenging, particularly for the models like deep neural networks having high-dimensional parameters. In this paper, we propose a novel Bayesian pseudocoreset construction method that operates on a function space. Unlike previous methods, which construct and match the coreset and full data posteriors in the space of model parameters (weights), our method constructs variational approximations to the coreset posterior on a function space and matches it to the full data posterior in the function space. By working directly on the function space, our method could bypass several challenges that may arise when working on a weight space, including limited scalability and multi-modality issue. Through various experiments, we demonstrate that the Bayesian pseudocoresets constructed from our method enjoys enhanced uncertainty quantification and better robustness across various model architectures",

    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "Visual navigation has been widely studied under the assumption that there may be several clear routes to reach the goal. However, in more practical scenarios such as a house with several messy rooms, there may not. Interactive Navigation (InterNav) considers agents navigating to their goals more effectively with object interactions, posing new challenges of learning interaction dynamics and extra action space. Previous works learn single vision-to-action policy with the guidance of designed representations. However, the causality between actions and outcomes is prone to be confounded when the attributes of obstacles are diverse and hard to measure. Learning policy for long-term action planning in complex scenes also leads to extensive inefficient exploration. In this paper, we introduce a causal diagram of InterNav clarifying the confounding bias caused by obstacles. To address the problem, we propose a multi-policy model that enables the exploration of counterfactual interactions as well as reduces unnecessary exploration. We develop a large-scale dataset containing 600k task episodes in 12k multi-room scenes based on the ProcTHOR simulator and showcase the effectiveness of our method with the evaluations on our dataset",

    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "Recent development in vision-language approaches has instigated a paradigm shift in learning visual recognition models from language supervision. These approaches align objects with language queries (e.g. \"a photo of a cat\") and thus improve the models' adaptability to novel objects and domains. Recent studies have attempted to query these models with complex language expressions that include specifications of fine-grained details, such as colors, shapes, and relations. However, simply incorporating language descriptions into queries does not guarantee accurate interpretation by the models. In fact, our experiments show that GLIP, a state-of-the-art vision-language model for object detection, often disregards contextual information in the language descriptions and instead relies heavily on detecting objects solely by their names. To tackle the challenge, we propose a new description-conditioned (DesCo) paradigm of learning object recognition models with rich language descriptions consisting of two innovations: 1) we employ a large language model as a commonsense knowledge engine to generate rich language descriptions of objects; 2) we design context-sensitive queries to improve the model's ability in deciphering intricate nuances embedded within descriptions and enforce the model to focus on context rather than object names alone. On two novel object detection benchmarks, LVIS and OminiLabel, under the zero-shot detection setting, our approach achieves 34.8 APr minival (+9.1) and 29.3 AP (+3.6), respectively, surpassing the prior state-of-the-art models, GLIP and FIBER, by a large margin",

    "abstract": "This paper presents a framework for computing the Gromov-Wasserstein problem between two sets of points in low dimensional spaces, where the discrepancy is the squared Euclidean norm. The Gromov-Wasserstein problem is a generalization of the optimal transport problem that finds the assignment between two sets preserving pairwise distances as much as possible. This can be used to quantify the similarity between two formations or shapes, a common problem in AI and machine learning. The problem can be formulated as a Quadratic Assignment Problem (QAP), which is in general computationally intractable even for small problems. Our framework addresses this challenge by reformulating the QAP as an optimization problem with a low-dimensional domain, leveraging the fact that the problem can be expressed as a concave quadratic optimization problem with low rank. The method scales well with the number of points, and it can be used to find the global solution for large-scale problems with thousands of points. We compare the computational complexity of our approach with state-of-the-art methods on synthetic problems and apply it to a near-symmetrical problem which is of particular interest in computational biology",

Our memory-efficient implicit differentiation scheme makes the SVAE tractable to learn via gradient descent, while demonstrating robustness to incomplete optimization. To more rapidly learn accurate graphical model parameters, we derive a method for computing natural gradients without manual derivations, which avoids biases found in prior work.

    "title": "How Re-sampling Helps for Long-Tail Learning?",
    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "Long-tail learning has received significant attention in recent years due to the challenge it poses with extremely imbalanced datasets. In these datasets, only a few classes (known as the head classes) have an adequate number of training samples, while the rest of the classes (known as the tail classes) are infrequent in the training data. Re-sampling is a classical and widely used approach for addressing class imbalance issues. Unfortunately, recent studies claim that re-sampling brings negligible performance improvements in modern long-tail learning tasks. This paper aims to investigate this phenomenon systematically. Our research shows that re-sampling can considerably improve generalization when the training images do not contain semantically irrelevant contexts. In other scenarios, however, it can learn unexpected spurious correlations between irrelevant contexts and target labels. We design experiments on two homogeneous datasets, one containing irrelevant context and the other not, to confirm our findings. To prevent the learning of spurious correlations, we propose a new context shift augmentation module that generates diverse training images for the tail class by maintaining a context bank extracted from the head-class images. Experiments demonstrate that our proposed module can boost the generalization and outperform other approaches, including class-balanced re-sampling, decoupled classifier re-training, and data augmentation methods.

GINO uses a signed distance function (SDF) representation of the input shape and neural operators based on graph and Fourier architectures to learn the solution operator. The graph neural operator handles irregular grids and transforms them into and from regular latent grids on which Fourier neural operator can be efficiently applied. We provide an efficient implementation of GINO using an optimized hashing approach, which allows efficient learning in a shared, compressed latent space with reduced computation and memory costs. GINO is discretization-invariant, meaning the trained model can be applied to arbitrary discretizations of the continuous domain and applies to any shape or resolution. To empirically validate the performance of our method on large-scale simulation, we generate the industry-standard aerodynamics dataset of 3D vehicle geometries with Reynolds numbers as high as five million. For this large-scale 3D fluid simulation, numerical methods are expensive to compute surface pressure. We successfully trained GINO to predict the pressure on car surfaces using only five hundred data points. The cost-accuracy experiments show a 26,000x speed-up compared to optimized GPU-based computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulators on computing the drag coefficient. When tested on new combinations of geometries and boundary conditions (inlet velocities), GINO obtains a one-fourth reduction in error rate compared to deep neural network approaches",

    "abstract": "Uncertainty estimation plays an important role for future reliable deployment of deep segmentation models in safety-critical scenarios such as medical applications. However, existing methods for uncertainty estimation have been limited by the lack of explicit guidance for calibrating the prediction risk and model confidence. In this work, we propose a novel fine-grained reward maximization (FGRM) framework, to address uncertainty estimation by directly utilizing an uncertainty metric related reward function with a reinforcement learning based model tuning algorithm. This would benefit the model uncertainty estimation with direct optimization guidance for model calibration. Specifically, our method designs a new uncertainty estimation reward function using the calibration metric, which is maximized to fine-tune an evidential learning pre-trained segmentation model for calibrating prediction risk. Importantly, we innovate an effective fine-grained parameter update scheme, which imposes fine-grained reward-weighting of each network parameter according to the parameter importance quantified by the fisher information matrix. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work exploring reward optimization for model uncertainty estimation in safety-critical vision tasks. The effectiveness of our method is demonstrated on two large safety-critical surgical scene segmentation datasets under two different uncertainty estimation settings. With real-time one forward pass at inference, our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods by a clear margin on all the calibration metrics of uncertainty estimation, while maintaining a high task accuracy for the segmentation results.

Recent works accelerate the sampling procedure by proposing fast ODE solvers that leverage the specific ODE form of DPMs. However, they highly rely on specific parameterization during inference (such as noise/data prediction), which might not be the optimal choice. In this work, we propose a novel formulation towards the optimal parameterization during sampling that minimizes the first-order discretization error of the ODE solution. Based on such formulation, we propose \\textit{DPM-Solver-v3}, a new fast ODE solver for DPMs by introducing several coefficients efficiently computed on the pretrained model, which we call \\textit{empirical model statistics}. We further incorporate multistep methods and a predictor-corrector framework, and propose some techniques for improving sample quality at small numbers of function evaluations (NFE) or large guidance scales.

    "abstract": "Recurrent spiking neural networks (RSNNs) hold great potential for advancing artificial general intelligence, as they draw inspiration from the biological nervous system and show promise in modeling complex dynamics. However, the widely-used surrogate gradient-based training methods for RSNNs are inherently inaccurate and unfriendly to neuromorphic hardware. To address these limitations, we propose the evolving connectivity (EC) framework, an inference-only method for training RSNNs. The EC framework reformulates weight-tuning as a search into parameterized connection probability distributions, and employs Natural Evolution Strategies (NES) for optimizing these distributions. Our EC framework circumvents the need for gradients and features hardware-friendly characteristics, including sparse boolean connections and high scalability. We evaluate EC on a series of standard robotic locomotion tasks, where it achieves comparable performance with deep neural networks and outperforms gradient-trained RSNNs, even solving the complex 17-DoF humanoid task. Additionally, the EC framework demonstrates a two to three fold speedup in efficiency compared to directly evolving parameters. By providing a performant and hardware-friendly alternative, the EC framework lays the groundwork for further energy-efficient applications of RSNNs and advances the development of neuromorphic devices.

Various fairness notions and methods have been proposed to mitigate such biases.

Learning fair models satisfying CF can be challenging. It was shown in (Kusner $\\textit{et al.}$) that a sufficient condition for satisfying CF is to $\\textbf{not}$ use features that are descendants of sensitive attributes in the causal graph. This implies a simple method that learns CF models only using non-descendants of sensitive attributes while eliminating all descendants.

In contrast, this work proposes a new algorithm that trains models using all the available features. We theoretically and empirically show that models trained with this method can satisfy CF",

Theoretically, it lacks feature identifiability and different initialization may lead to totally different features. In this paper, we study a new method named tri-factor contrastive learning (triCL) that involves a 3-factor contrast in the form of $z_x^\\top S z_{x'}$, where $S=\\text{diag}(s_1,\\dots,s_k)$ is a learnable diagonal matrix that automatically captures the importance of each feature.

We show that features with high importance have nice interpretability by capturing common classwise features, and obtain superior performance when evaluated for image retrieval using a few features. The proposed triCL objective is general and can be applied to different contrastive learning methods like SimCLR and CLIP.

Meanwhile, such a reasoning process is guided by two crucial properties for understanding HOI: affordances (the potential actions an object can facilitate) and proxemics (the spatial relations between humans and objects). We formulate these two properties in first-order logic and ground them into continuous space to constrain the learning process of our approach, leading to improved performance and zero-shot generalization capabilities. We evaluate L OGIC HOI on V-COCO and HICO-DET under both normal and zero-shot setups, achieving significant improvements over existing methods",
