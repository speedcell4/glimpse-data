    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "In the current era of vast data and transparent machine learning, it is essential for techniques to operate at a large scale while providing a clear mathematical comprehension of the internal workings of the method. Although there already exist interpretable semi-parametric regression methods for large-scale applications that take into account non-linearity in the data, the complexity of the models is still often limited. One of the main challenges is the absence of interactions in these models, which are left out for the sake of better interpretability but also due to impractical computational costs. To overcome this limitation, we propose a new approach using a factorization method to derive a highly scalable higher-order tensor product spline model. Our method allows for the incorporation of all (higher-order) interactions of non-linear feature effects while having computational costs proportional to a model without interactions. We further develop a meaningful penalization scheme and examine the induced optimization problem. We conclude by evaluating the predictive and estimation performance of our method",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "The importance of dealing with big data is further increasing, as machine learning (ML) systems obtain useful knowledge from big datasets. However, using all data is practically prohibitive because of the massive sizes of the datasets, so summarizing them by centers obtained from k-center clustering is a promising approach. We have two concerns here. One is fairness, because if the summary does not have some specific groups, subsequent applications may provide unfair results for the groups. The other is the presence of outliers, and if outliers dominate the summary, it cannot be useful. To overcome these concerns, we address the problem of fair k-center clustering with outliers. Although prior works studied the fair k-center clustering problem, they do not consider outliers. This paper yields a linear time algorithm that satisfies the fairness constraint of our problem and probabilistically guarantees the almost 3-approximation bound. Its empirical efficiency and effectiveness are also reported",

For e.g., experiments on social media, or medical and social interventions to control the spread of an epidemic. In such settings, the SUTVA assumption for randomized-controlled trials is violated due to network interference, or spill-over effects, as treatments to group A can potentially also affect the control group B. When the underlying social network is known exactly, prior works have demonstrated how to conduct A/B tests adequately to estimate the global average treatment effect (GATE). However, in practice, it is often impossible to obtain knowledge about the exact underlying network. In this paper, we present UNITE: a novel estimator that relax this assumption and can identify GATE while only relying on knowledge of the superset of neighbors for any subject in the graph. Through theoretical analysis and extensive experiments, we show that the proposed approach performs better in comparison to standard estimators",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Fairness is a growing concern in machine learning as state-of-the-art models may amplify social prejudice by making biased predictions against specific demographics such as race and gender. Such discrimination raises issues in various fields such as employment, criminal justice, and trust score evaluation. To address the concerns, we propose learning fair representation through a straightforward yet effective approach to project intrinsic information while filtering sensitive information for downstream tasks. Our model consists of two goals: one is to ensure that the latent data from different demographic groups is non-separable (i.e., make the latent data distribution independent of the sensitive feature to improve fairness); the other is to maximize the separability of latent data from different classes (i.e., maintain the discriminative power of data for the sake of the downstream tasks like classification). Our method adopts a non-zero-sum adversarial game to minimize the distance between data from different demographic groups while maximizing the margin between data from different classes. Moreover, the proposed objective function can be easily generalized to multiple sensitive attributes and multi-class scenarios as it upper bounds popular fairness metrics in these cases. We provide theoretical analysis of the fairness of our model and validate w.r.t. both fairness and predictive performance on benchmark datasets",

Existing works assume that neighbors' information offers the basis for estimating the unobserved target while ignoring non-neighbors. However, neighbors could also be quite different or even misleading, and the non-neighbors could still offer constructive information. To this end, we propose \"Contrastive-Prototypical\" self-supervised learning for Kriging (KCP): (1) The neighboring contrastive module coarsely pushes neighbors together and non-neighbors apart. (2) In parallel, the prototypical module identifies similar representations via exchanged prediction, such that it refines the misleading neighbors and recycles the useful non-neighbors from the neighboring contrast component. As a result, not all the neighbors and some of the non-neighbors will be used to infer the target. (3) To learn general and robust representations, we design an adaptive augmentation module that encourages data diversity. Theoretical bound is derived for the proposed augmentation. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate the superior performance of KCP compared to its peers with 6% improvements and exceptional transferability and robustness",

    "abstract": "Post-hoc explanation methods have become a critical tool for understanding black-box classifiers in high-stakes applications. However, high-performing classifiers are often highly nonlinear and can exhibit complex behavior around the decision boundary, leading to brittle or misleading local explanations. Therefore there is an impending need to quantify the uncertainty of such explanation methods in order to understand when explanations are trustworthy. In this work we propose the Gaussian Process Explanation unCertainty (GPEC) framework, which generates a unified uncertainty estimate combining decision boundary-aware uncertainty with explanation function approximation uncertainty. We introduce a novel geodesic-based kernel, which captures the complexity of the target black-box decision boundary. We show theoretically that the proposed kernel similarity increases with decision boundary complexity. The proposed framework is highly flexible; it can be used with any black-box classifier and feature attribution method. Empirical results on multiple tabular and image datasets show that the GPEC uncertainty estimate improves understanding of explanations as compared to existing methods",

We show that the tightest possible bound is obtained with the comparator being the convex conjugate of the CGF of the bounding distribution, also known as the Cramér function.

We prove excess risk bounds on the original structured prediction problem, showing how to attain close-to-optimal rates with a reduced sketch size that depends on the eigendecay of the input/output covariance operators. From a computational perspective, we show that the two approximations have distinct but complementary impacts: sketching the input kernel mostly reduces training time, while sketching the output kernel decreases the inference time.

Importantly, our approach does not require the user to choose the desired number of clusters, yields improved model selection if they do, and yields interpretable hierarchically clustered embedding dendrograms.

Recent works suggest that these estimators are more statistically efficient than plug-in (linear programming-based) OT estimators when comparing probability measures in high-dimensions (Vacher et al., 2021). Unfortunately,that statistical benefit comes at a very steep computational price: because their computation relies on the short-step interior-point method (SSIPM), which comes with a large iteration count in practice, these estimators quickly become intractable w.r.t. sample size $n$. To scale these estimators to larger $n$, we propose a nonsmooth fixedpoint model for the kernel-based OT problem, and show that it can be efficiently solved via a specialized semismooth Newton (SSN) method: We show, exploring the problem's structure, that the per-iteration cost of performing one SSN step can be significantly reduced in practice.

In this work, we present a general, unified local causal discovery method with linear non-Gaussian models, whether they are cyclic or acyclic. We extend the application of independent component analysis from the global context to independent subspace analysis, enabling the exact identification of the equivalent local directed structures and causal strengths from the Markov blanket of the target variable.

That is, the model should produce higher uncertainty for inputs that are improbable in the training data and lower uncertainty for inputs that are more probable. To operationalize this criterion, we develop the density uncertainty layer, a stochastic neural network architecture that satisfies the density uncertain criterion by design.

This is of great interest in many applications, such as medical imaging. Current state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods are latent variable models based on VAE (CA-VAEs). However, they all either ignore important constraints or they don't enforce fundamental assumptions. This may lead to sub-optimal solutions where distinctive factors are mistaken for common ones (or viceversa).

Here, we propose Double InfoGAN, the first GAN based method for CA that leverages the high-quality synthesis of GAN and the separation power of InfoGAN. Experimental results on four visual datasets, from simple synthetic examples to complex medical images, show that the proposed method outperforms SOTA CA-VAEs in terms of latent separation and image quality.

    "title": "Is this model reliable for everyone? Testing for strong calibration",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "In a well-calibrated risk prediction model, the average predicted probability is close to the true event rate for any given subgroup. Such models are reliable across heterogeneous populations and satisfy strong notions of algorithmic fairness. However, the task of auditing a model for strong calibration is well-known to be difficult—particularly for machine learning (ML) algorithms—due to the sheer number of potential subgroups. As such, common practice is to only assess calibration with respect to a few predefined subgroups. Recent developments in goodness-of-fit testing offer potential solutions but are not designed for settings with weak signal or where the poorly calibrated subgroup is small, as they either overly subdivide the data or fail to divide the data at all. We introduce a new testing procedure based on the following insight: if we can reorder observations by their expected residuals, there should be a change in the association between the predicted and observed residuals along this sequence if a poorly calibrated subgroup exists. This lets us reframe the problem of calibration testing into one of changepoint detection, for which powerful methods already exist. We begin with introducing a sample-splitting procedure where a portion of the data is used to train a suite of candidate models for predicting the residual, and the remaining data are used to perform a score-based cumulative sum (CUSUM) test. To further improve power, we then extend this adaptive CUSUM test to incorporate cross-validation, while maintaining Type I error control under minimal assumptions. Compared to existing methods, the proposed procedure consistently achieved higher power in empirical analyses",

We provide theoretical justifications for this robustness inheritance phenomenon. Our theoretical results reveal that feature purification plays an important role in connecting the adversarial robustness of the pre-trained model and the downstream tasks in two-layer neural networks. Specifically, we show that (i) with adversarial training, each hidden node tends to pick only one (or a few) feature; (ii) without adversarial training, the hidden nodes can be vulnerable to attacks. This observation is valid for both supervised pre-training and contrastive learning. With purified nodes, it turns out that clean training is enough to achieve adversarial robustness in downstream tasks",

In this paper, we define two problems, motivated by designing fast algorithms for \\emph{proxy} of attention matrix and solving regressions against them. Given an input matrix $A\\in \\mathbb{R}^{n\\times d}$ with $n\\gg d$ and a response vector $b$, we first consider the matrix exponential of the matrix $A^\\top A$ as a proxy, and we in turn design algorithms for two types of regression problems: $\\min_{x\\in \\mathbb{R}^d}\\|(A^\\top A)^jx-b\\|_2$ and $\\min_{x\\in \\mathbb{R}^d}\\|A(A^\\top A)^jx-b\\|_2$ for any positive integer $j$. Studying algorithms for these regressions is essential, as matrix exponential can be approximated term-by-term via these smaller problems. The second proxy is applying exponential entrywise to the Gram matrix, denoted by $\\exp(AA^\\top)$ and solving the regression $\\min_{x\\in \\mathbb{R}^n}\\|\\exp(AA^\\top)x-b \\|_2$. We call this problem the \\emph{attention kernel regression} problem, as the matrix $\\exp(AA^\\top)$ could be viewed as a kernel function with respect to $A$.

    "abstract": "Deep learning-based visual perception models lack robustness when faced with camera motion perturbations in practice. The current certification process for assessing robustness is costly and time-consuming due to the extensive number of image projections required for Monte Carlo sampling in the 3D camera motion space. To address these challenges, we present a novel, efficient, and practical framework for certifying the robustness of 3D-2D projective transformations against camera motion perturbations. Our approach leverages a smoothing distribution over the 2D-pixel space instead of in the 3D physical space, eliminating the need for costly camera motion sampling and significantly enhancing the efficiency of robustness certifications. With the pixel-wise smoothed classifier, we are able to fully upper bound the projection errors using a technique of uniform partitioning in camera motion space. Additionally, we extend our certification framework to a more general scenario where only a single-frame point cloud is required in the projection oracle. Through extensive experimentation, we validate the trade-off between effectiveness and efficiency enabled by our proposed method. Remarkably, our approach achieves approximately 80% certified accuracy while utilizing only 30% of the projected image frames",

DPPs are a very well-studied class of distributions on subsets of items drawn from a ground set of cardinality $n$ characterized by a symmetric $n \\times n$ kernel matrix $L$ such that the probability of any subset is proportional to the determinant of its corresponding principal submatrix. Recent work has shown that the kernel symmetry constraint can be relaxed, leading to NDPPs, which can better model data in several machine learning applications. Given a low-rank kernel matrix ${\\cal L}=L+L^\\top\\in \\mathbb{R}^{n\\times n}$ and its corresponding eigendecomposition specified by $\\{\\lambda_i, u_i \\}_{i=1}^d$ where $d\\leq n$ is the rank, we design a data structure that uses $O(nd)$ space and preprocesses data in $O(nd^{\\omega-1})$ time where $\\omega\\approx 2.37$ is the exponent of matrix multiplication.

This improves upon the space and preprocessing time over prior works, and achieves a state-of-the-art sampling time when the sampling set is relatively dense.

This novel approach provides Wasserstein approximations with accuracy similar to the original tree methods on text datasets while being faster in practice. Finally, these algorithms are applicable beyond tree approximations: using sliced projections of the original data still provides fairly good accuracy while eliminating the need for embedding the data in a fixed and rigid tree structure.

    "title": "Emergent specialization from participation dynamics and multi-learner retraining",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Numerous online services are data-driven: the behavior of users affects the system's parameters, and the system's parameters affect the users' experience of the service, which in turn affects the way users may interact with the system. For example, people may choose to use a service only for tasks that already works well, or they may choose to switch to a different service. These adaptations influence the ability of a system to learn about a population of users and tasks in order to improve its performance broadly. In this work, we analyze a class of such dynamics—where users allocate their participation amongst services to reduce the individual risk they experience, and services update their model parameters to reduce the service's risk on their current user population. We refer to these dynamics as \\emph{risk-reducing}, which cover a broad class of common model updates including gradient descent and multiplicative weights. For this general class of dynamics, we show that asymptotically stable equilibria are always segmented, with sub-populations allocated to a single learner. Under mild assumptions, the utilitarian social optimum is a stable equilibrium. In contrast to previous work, which shows that repeated risk minimization can result in representation disparity and high overall loss with a single learner (Hashimoto et al., 2018; Miller et al., 2021), we find that repeated myopic updates with multiple learners lead to better outcomes. We illustrate the phenomena via a simulated example initialized from real data",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Deep generative models for de novo molecular generation using discrete data, such as the simplified molecular-input line-entry system (SMILES) strings, have attracted widespread attention in drug design. However, training instability often plagues generative adversarial networks (GANs), leading to problems such as mode collapse and low diversity. This study proposes a pure transformer encoder-based GAN (TenGAN) to solve these issues. The generator and discriminator of TenGAN are variants of the transformer encoders and are combined with reinforcement learning (RL) to generate molecules with the desired chemical properties. Besides, data augmentation of the variant SMILES is leveraged for the TenGAN training to learn the semantics and syntax of SMILES strings. Additionally, we introduce an enhanced variant of TenGAN, named Ten(W)GAN, which incorporates mini-batch discrimination and Wasserstein GAN to improve the ability to generate molecules. The experimental results and ablation studies on the QM9 and ZINC datasets showed that the proposed models generated highly valid and novel molecules with the desired chemical properties in a computationally efficient manner",

    "abstract": "The quality of explanations for the predictions made by complex machine learning predictors is often measured using insertion and deletion metrics, which assess the faithfulness of the explanations, i.e., how accurately the explanations reflect the predictor's behavior. To improve the faithfulness, we propose insertion/deletion metric-aware explanation-based optimization (ID-ExpO), which optimizes differentiable predictors to improve both the insertion and deletion scores of the explanations while maintaining their predictive accuracy. Because the original insertion and deletion metrics are non-differentiable with respect to the explanations and directly unavailable for gradient-based optimization, we extend the metrics so that they are differentiable and use them to formalize insertion and deletion metric-based regularizers. Our experimental results on image and tabular datasets show that the deep neural network-based predictors that are fine-tuned using ID-ExpO enable popular post-hoc explainers to produce more faithful and easier-to-interpret explanations while maintaining high predictive accuracy.

In this scenario, the optimal policy then belongs to some unknown feasible set.

Consequently, we propose and analyze an algorithm that switches between pessimism and optimism in the face of uncertainty. We prove both precise problem-dependent and problem-independent bounds, demonstrating that our algorithm achieves the best of the two approaches—depending on the presence or absence of a feasibility margin—in terms of constraint violation guarantees. Furthermore, our results indicate that playing greedily on the constraints actually outperforms pessimism when considering long-term violations rather than violations on a per-round basis",

    "abstract": "Multiplayer bandits have recently garnered significant attention due to their relevance in cognitive radio networks. While the existing body of literature predominantly focuses on synchronous players, real-world radio networks, such as those in IoT applications, often feature asynchronous (i.e., randomly activated) devices. This highlights the need for addressing the more challenging asynchronous multiplayer bandits problem. Our first result shows that a natural extension of UCB achieves a minimax regret of $\\mathcal{O}(\\sqrt{T\\log(T)})$ in the centralized setting. More significantly, we introduce Cautious Greedy, which uses $\\mathcal{O}(\\log(T))$ communications and whose instance-dependent regret is constant if the optimal policy assigns at least one player to each arm (a situation proven to occur when arm means are sufficiently close). Otherwise, the regret is, as usual, $\\log(T)$ times the sum of some inverse sub-optimality gaps. We substantiate the optimality of Cautious Greedy through lower-bound analysis based on data-dependent terms. Therefore, we establish a strong baseline for asynchronous multiplayer bandits, at least with $\\mathcal{O}(\\log(T))$ communications",

To obtain a bound for the expected posterior loss, we present bounds for the posterior variance and squared bias. The squared bias bound depends on the regression model used, which can be arbitrary and not based on GPs. The bounds scale well with data size, in contrast to computing the GP posterior by a Cholesky factorisation of a large matrix. More importantly, our bounds do not require strong prior knowledge as we do not specify the exact kernel form. We validate our theoretical findings by numerical experiments and show that the bounds have applications in uncertainty estimation and concept drift detection",

Noisy or impure datasets can pose a challenge for traditional normalization methods as they may contain outliers that violate statistical assumptions, leading to reduced model performance and increased unpredictability. Non-linear Tanh-Estimators (TE) have been found to provide robust feature normalization, but their fixed scaling factor may not be appropriate for all distributions of feature values. This work presents a refinement to the TE that employs the Wasserstein distance to adaptively estimate the optimal scaling factor for each feature individually against a specified target distribution. The results demonstrate that this adaptive approach can outperform the current TE method in the literature in terms of convergence speed by enabling better initial training starts, thus reducing or eliminating the need to re-adjust model weights during early training phases due to inadequately scaled features.

In particular, we are interested in discovering instance-level causal structures in an unsupervised manner. Instance-level causality identifies causal relationships among individual events, providing more fine-grained information for decision-making. Existing work in the literature either requires strong assumptions, such as linearity in the intensity function, or heuristically defined model parameters that do not necessarily meet the requirements of Granger causality. We propose Instance-wise Self-Attentive Hawkes Processes (ISAHP), a novel deep learning framework that can directly infer the Granger causality at the event instance level. ISAHP is the first neural point process model that meets the requirements of Granger causality. It leverages the self-attention mechanism of the transformer to align with the principles of Granger causality. We empirically demonstrate that ISAHP is capable of discovering complex instance-level causal structures that cannot be handled by classical models. We also show that ISAHP achieves state-of-the-art performance in proxy tasks involving type-level causal discovery and instance-level event type prediction",

Here we consider the sign-function-based comparison feedback model and analyze the convergence rates with batched and multiway (argmin of a set queried points) comparisons. Our main goal is to understand the improved convergence rates owing to parallelization in sign-feedback-based optimization problems. Our work is the first to study the problem of convex optimization with multiway preferences and analyze the optimal convergence rates. Our first contribution lies in designing efficient algorithms with a convergence rate of $\\smash{\\widetilde O}(\\frac{d}{\\min\\{m,d\\} \\epsilon})$ for $m$-batched preference feedback where the learner can query $m$-pairs in parallel.

However, such methods do not take full advantage of the FL setup where the server, throughout the training process, has side information in the form of a global distribution $p_{\\theta}$ that is close to the client-only distribution $q_{\\phi^{(n)}}$ in Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence. In this work, we exploit this \\emph{closeness} between the clients' distributions $q_{\\phi^{(n)}}$'s and the side information $p_{\\theta}$ at the server, and propose a framework that requires approximately $D_{KL}(q_{\\phi^{(n)}}|| p_{\\theta})$ bits of communication.

This fixed approach is inefficient because of a dynamic trade-off between cost and speed—larger batches are more costly, smaller batches lead to slower wall-clock run-times—and the trade-off may change over the run (larger batches are often preferable earlier). To address this trade-off, we propose a novel Probabilistic Numerics framework that adaptively changes batch sizes. By framing batch selection as a quadrature task, our integration-error-aware algorithm facilitates the automatic tuning of batch sizes to meet predefined quadrature precision objectives, akin to how typical optimizers terminate based on convergence thresholds. This approach obviates the necessity for exhaustive searches across all potential batch sizes. We also extend this to scenarios with constrained active learning and constrained optimization, interpreting constraint violations as reductions in the precision requirement, to subsequently adapt batch construction. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our approach significantly enhances learning efficiency and flexibility in diverse Bayesian batch active learning and Bayesian optimization applications",

While attempts have been made to develop human-centric optimizers, they typically assume user knowledge is well-specified and error-free, employing users mainly as supervisors of the optimization process. We relax these assumptions and propose a more balanced human-AI partnership with our Collaborative and Explainable Bayesian Optimization (CoExBO) framework. Instead of explicitly requiring a user to provide a knowledge model, CoExBO employs preference learning to seamlessly integrate human insights into the optimization, resulting in algorithmic suggestions that resonate with user preference. CoExBO explains its candidate selection every iteration to foster trust, empowering users with a clearer grasp of the optimization. Furthermore, CoExBO offers a no-harm guarantee, allowing users to make mistakes; even with extreme adversarial interventions, the algorithm converges asymptotically to a vanilla Bayesian optimization. We validate CoExBO's efficacy through human-AI teaming experiments in lithium-ion battery design, highlighting substantial improvements over conventional methods.

    "abstract": "The agnostic setting is the hardest generalization of the PAC model since it is akin to learning with adversarial noise. In this paper, we give a poly $(n, t, 1/\\epsilon)$ quantum algorithm for learning size $t$ decision trees over $n$-bit inputs with uniform marginal over instances, in the agnostic setting, without membership queries (MQ). This is the first algorithm (classical or quantum) for efficiently learning decision trees without MQ. First, we construct a quantum agnostic weak learner by designing a quantum variant of the classical Goldreich-Levin algorithm that works with strongly biased function oracles. Next, we show how to quantize the agnostic boosting algorithm by Kalai and Kanade (2009) to obtain the first efficient quantum agnostic boosting algorithm (that has a polynomial speedup over existing adaptive quantum boosting algorithms). We then use the quantum agnostic boosting algorithm to boost the weak quantum agnostic learner constructed previously to obtain a quantum agnostic learner for decision trees. Using the above framework, we also give quantum decision tree learning algorithms without MQ in weaker noise models",

But so far very little attention has been paid to whether providing recourse is beneficial or not. We introduce an abstract learning-theoretic framework that compares the risks (i.e., expected losses) for classification with and without algorithmic recourse. This allows us to answer the question of when providing recourse is beneficial or harmful at the population level. Surprisingly, we find that there are many plausible scenarios in which providing recourse turns out to be harmful, because it pushes users to regions of higher class uncertainty and therefore leads to more mistakes. We further study whether the party deploying the classifier has an incentive to strategize in anticipation of having to provide recourse, and we find that sometimes they do, to the detriment of their users. Providing algorithmic recourse may therefore also be harmful at the systemic level. We confirm our theoretical findings in experiments on simulated and real-world data. All in all, we conclude that the current concept of algorithmic recourse is not reliably beneficial, and therefore requires rethinking",

Given a graph, a set of $k$ terminals and an initial partitioning of the graph, the $r$-move $k$-partitioning problem aims to find a $k$-partitioning with the minimum-weighted cut among all the $k$-partitionings that can be obtained by moving at most $r$ non-terminal nodes to partitions different from their initial ones.

The rationale behind our approach relies on the fact that, the independence hypothesis $\\mathcal{H}_0$ is necessarily false as soon as the optimal scoring function related to the pair of distributions $(H\\otimes G,;{F})$, obtained from a bipartite ranking algorithm, has a ROC curve that deviates from the main diagonal of the unit square. We consider a wide class of rank statistics encompassing many ways of deviating from the diagonal in the ROC space to build tests of independence. Beyond its great flexibility, this new method has theoretical properties that far surpass those of its competitors. Nonasymptotic bounds for the two types of testing errors are established. From an empirical perspective, the novel procedure we promote in this paper exhibits a remarkable ability to detect small departures, of various types, from the null assumption $\\mathcal{H}_0$, even in high dimension, as supported by the numerical experiments presented here",

    "abstract": "Matching a source to a target probability measure is often solved by instantiating a linear optimal transport (OT) problem, parameterized by a ground cost function that quantifies discrepancy between points. When these measures live in the same metric space, the ground cost often defaults to its distance. When instantiated across two different spaces, however, choosing that cost in the absence of aligned data is a conundrum. As a result, practitioners often resort to solving instead a quadratic Gromow-Wasserstein (GW) problem. We exploit in this work a parallel between GW and cost-regularized OT, the regularized minimization of a linear OT objective parameterized by a ground cost. We use this cost-regularized formulation to match measures across two different Euclidean spaces, where the cost is evaluated between transformed source points and target points. We show that several quadratic OT problems fall in this category, and consider enforcing structure in linear transform (e.g., sparsity), by introducing structure-inducing regularizers. We provide a proximal algorithm to extract such transforms from unaligned data, and demonstrate its applicability to single-cell spatial transcriptomics/multiomics matching tasks",

    "abstract": "Self-training is a well-known approach for semi-supervised learning. It consists of iteratively assigning pseudo-labels to unlabeled data for which the model is confident and treating them as labeled examples. For neural networks, \\texttt{softmax} prediction probabilities are often used as a confidence measure, although they are known to be overconfident, even for wrong predictions. This phenomenon is particularly intensified in the presence of sample selection bias, i.e., when data labeling is subject to some constraints. To address this issue, we propose a novel confidence measure, called $\\mathcal{T}$-similarity, built upon the prediction diversity of an ensemble of linear classifiers. We provide the theoretical analysis of our approach by studying stationary points and describing the relationship between the diversity of the individual members and their performance. We empirically demonstrate the benefit of our confidence measure for three different pseudo-labeling policies on classification datasets of various data modalities.

Our experiments verify these findings and highlight a few shortcomings of our algorithms.

Good generalization indicates the model can predict unseen data correctly when trained under a limited number of data. Federated learning (FL), which has emerged as a popular distributed learning framework, allows multiple devices or clients to train a shared model without violating privacy requirements. While the existing literature has studied extensively the generalization performances of centralized machine learning algorithms, similar analysis in the federated settings is either absent or with very restrictive assumptions on the loss functions. In this paper, we aim to analyze the generalization performances of federated learning by means of algorithmic stability, which measures the change of the output model of an algorithm when perturbing one data point. Three widely-used algorithms are studied, including FedAvg, SCAFFOLD, and FedProx, under convex and non-convex loss functions. Our analysis shows that the generalization performances of models trained by these three algorithms are closely related to the heterogeneity of clients' datasets as well as the convergence behaviors of the algorithms. Particularly, in the i.i.d. setting, our results recover the classical results of stochastic gradient descent (SGD)",

    "title": "Mechanics of Next Token Prediction with Self-Attention",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Transformer-based language models are trained on large datasets to predict the next token given an input sequence. Despite this simple training objective, they have led to revolutionary advances in natural language processing. Underlying this success is the self-attention mechanism. In this work, we ask: What does a single self-attention layer learn from next-token prediction? We show that training self-attention with gradient descent learns an automaton which generates the next token in two distinct steps: (1) Hard retrieval: Given input sequence, self-attention precisely selects the high-priority input tokens associated with the last input token. (2) Soft composition: It then creates a convex combination of the high-priority tokens from which the next token can be sampled. Under suitable conditions, we rigorously characterize these mechanics through a directed graph over tokens extracted from the training data. We prove that gradient descent implicitly discovers the strongly-connected components (SCC) of this graph and self-attention learns to retrieve the tokens that belong to the highest-priority SCC available in the context window. Our theory relies on decomposing the model weights into a directional component and a finite component that correspond to hard retrieval and soft composition steps respectively. This also formalizes a related implicit bias formula conjectured in [Tarzanagh et al. 2023]. We hope that these findings shed light on how self-attention processes sequential data and pave the path toward demystifying more complex architectures",

Nonasymptotic bound is provided for the estimation error of the target model, showing the robustness of the proposed method to covariate shifts.

To achieve this goal, we introduce a fusion penalty to encourage the ITRs based on different outcomes to yield similar recommendations. Two algorithms are proposed to estimate the ITR using surrogate loss functions. We prove that the agreement rate between the estimated ITR of the primary outcome and the optimal ITRs of the secondary outcomes converges to the true agreement rate faster than if the secondary outcomes are not taken into consideration. Furthermore, we derive the non-asymptotic properties of the value function and misclassification rate for the proposed method.

In doing so, we provide a simple and clean explanation of when and why random reward perturbations give rise to good bandit algorithms. We propose data-dependent perturbations not present in previous PHE-type methods that allow EVILL to match the performance of Thompson-sampling-style parameter-perturbation methods, both in theory and in practice.

To address these issues, we propose a novel method that leverages post-intervention information, specifically time-varying correlates of the causal effect called \"surrogates\", within the synthetic control framework. We establish conditions for identifying model parameters using the proximal inference framework and apply the generalized method of moments (GMM) approach for estimation and inference about the average treatment effect on the treated (ATT). Interestingly, we uncover specific conditions under which exclusively using post-intervention data suffices for estimation within our framework. Through a synthetic experiment and a real-world application, we demonstrate that our method can outperform other synthetic control methods in estimating both short-term and long-term effects, yielding more accurate inferences",

Simple mean-field families often lead to poor approximations, while rich families of distributions like normalizing flows can be difficult to optimize and usually do not incorporate the known structure of the target distribution due to their black-box nature. To expand the space of flexible variational families, we revisit Variational Rejection Sampling (VRS) [Grover et al., 2018], which combines a parametric proposal distribution with rejection sampling to define a rich non-parametric family of distributions that explicitly utilizes the known target distribution. By introducing a low-variance reparameterized gradient estimator for the parameters of the proposal distribution, we make VRS an attractive inference strategy for models with continuous latent variables. We argue theoretically and demonstrate empirically that the resulting method–Reparameterized Variational Rejection Sampling (RVRS)–offers an attractive trade-off between computational cost and inference fidelity. In experiments we show that our method performs well in practice and that it is well suited for black-box inference, especially for models with local latent variables",

For the generalization error, we find that optimally-regularised ERM is asymptotically consistent in the large sample complexity limit if one perform a simple calibration, and compute the rates of convergence.

In particular, our analysis allows the noise norm to have an unbounded expectation. To achieve these results, we stabilize stochastic gradients, using smoothed medians of means.

    "abstract": "Causal representation learning has emerged as the center of action in causal machine learning research. In particular, multi-domain datasets present a natural opportunity for showcasing the advantages of causal representation learning over standard unsupervised representation learning. While recent works have taken crucial steps towards learning causal representations, they often lack applicability to multi-domain datasets due to over-simplifying assumptions about the data; e.g. each domain comes from a different single-node perfect intervention. In this work, we relax these assumptions and capitalize on the following observation: there often exists a subset of latents whose certain distributional properties (e.g., support, variance) remain stable across domains; this property holds when, for example, each domain comes from a multi-node imperfect intervention. Leveraging this observation, we show that autoencoders that incorporate such invariances can provably identify the stable set of latents from the rest across different settings",

    "abstract": "Detecting novelties given unlabeled examples of normal data is a challenging task in machine learning, particularly when the novel and normal categories are semantically close. Large deep models pretrained on massive datasets can provide a rich representation space in which the simple k-nearest neighbor distance works as a novelty measure. However, as we show in this paper, the basic k-NN method might be insufficient in this context due to ignoring the 'local geometry' of the distribution over representations as well as the impact of irrelevant 'background features'. To address this, we propose a fully unsupervised novelty detection approach that integrates the flexibility of k-NN with a locally adapted scaling of dimensions based on the 'neighbors of nearest neighbor' and computing a 'likelihood ratio' in pretrained (self-supervised) representation spaces. Our experiments with image data show the advantage of this method when off-the-shelf vision transformers (e.g., pretrained by DINO) are used as the feature extractor without any fine-tuning",

Under mild assumptions, the proposed iterative methods exhibit explicit, non-asymptotic convergence rates that blend those of the gradient descent and Cubic Regularized Newton's methods. The proposed approach also includes an accelerated version for convex functions. Notably, these rates are achieved adaptively without prior knowledge of the function's parameters. The framework presented in this study is generic, and its special cases include algorithms such as Newton's method with random subspaces, finite differences, or lazy Hessian.

In this setting, state-of-the-art AGRs suffer from selection bias, leading to significant performance drop for particular classes; they are also more vulnerable to Byzantine attacks due to the increased variation among gradients of honest clients. To address these limitations, we propose an efficient two-stage method named BOBA. Theoretically, we prove the convergence of BOBA with an error of the optimal order.

Multiple works have highlighted the shortcomings of widely used metrics and exposed how they fail to behave as expected in some settings. So far, the response has been to use a variety of metrics that target different desirable and interpretable properties such as fidelity, diversity, and authenticity, to obtain a clearer picture of a generative model's capabilities. These methods mainly focus on ordinal data and they all suffer from the same unavoidable issues stemming from estimating quantities of high-dimensional data from a limited number of samples. We propose to take an alternative approach and to return to the synthetic data setting where the ground truth is explicit and known. We focus on nominal categorical data and introduce an evaluation method that can scale to the high-dimensional settings often encountered in practice. Our method involves successively binning the large space to obtain smaller probability spaces and coarser distributions where meaningful statistical estimates can be obtained. This allows us to provide probabilistic guarantees and sample complexities and we illustrate how our method can be applied to distinguish between the capabilities of several state-of-the-art categorical models",

    "abstract": "Performance monitoring of machine learning (ML)-based risk prediction models in healthcare is complicated by the issue of performativity: when an algorithm predicts a patient to be at high risk for an adverse event, clinicians are more likely to administer prophylactic treatment and alter the very target that the algorithm aims to predict. A simple approach is to ignore performativity and monitor only the untreated patients, whose outcomes remain unaltered. In general, ignoring performativity may inflate Type I error because (i) untreated patients disproportionally represent those with low predicted risk, and (ii) changes in the clinician's trust in the ML algorithm and the algorithm itself can induce complex dependencies that violate standard assumptions. Nevertheless, we show that valid inference is still possible when monitoring \\textit{conditional} rather than marginal performance measures under either the assumption of conditional exchangeability or time-constant selection bias. Finally, performativity can vary over time and induce nonstationarity in the data, which presents challenges for monitoring. To this end, we introduce a new score-based cumulative sum (CUSUM) monitoring procedure with dynamic control limits. Through extensive simulation studies, we study applications of the score-based CUSUM and how it is affected by various factors, including the efficiency of model updating procedures and the level of clinician trust.

We establish the first formal guarantees on unknown weighted graphs and provide lower bounds showing that the algorithms we propose have optimal or nearly-optimal dependence on the prediction error. Further, we perform numerical experiments demonstrating that in addition to being robust to adversarial error, our algorithms perform well in typical instances in which the error is stochastic.

In this work, we propose a novel online learning setting, namely, Autoregressive Bandits (ARBs), in which the observed reward is governed by an autoregressive process of order $k$, whose parameters depend on the chosen action. We show that, under mild assumptions on the reward process, the optimal policy can be conveniently computed.

Concurrently, deep learning methods have revolutionized image segmentation, a task closely related to voxel-based multiple testing. In this paper, we propose DeepFDR, a novel spatial FDR control method that leverages unsupervised deep learning-based image segmentation to address the voxel-based multiple testing problem. Numerical studies, including comprehensive simulations and Alzheimer's disease FDG-PET image analysis, demonstrate DeepFDR's superiority over existing methods.

As a function of the error of the inner problem resolution, we study the error of the IFT method. We analyze two strategies to reduce this error: preconditioning the IFT formula and reparameterizing the inner problem. We give a detailed account of the impact of these two modifications on the error, highlighting the role played by higher-order derivatives of the functionals at stake. Our theoretical findings explain when super efficiency, namely reaching an error on the hypergradient that depends quadratically on the error on the inner problem, is achievable and compare the two approaches when this is impossible.

In this work, we propose fitting concise yet precise rule models that learn to avoid relying on features with missing values and, therefore, limit their reliance on imputation at test time. We develop MINTY, a method that learns rules in the form of disjunctions between variables that act as replacements for each other when one or more is missing. This results in a sparse linear rule model, regularized to have small dependence on features with missing values, that allows a trade-off between goodness of fit, interpretability, and robustness to missing values at test time.

These optimal features typically depend on tunable parameters of the lower-level energy in such a way that the entire bilevel pipeline can be trained end-to-end. Although not generally presented as such, this paper demonstrates how a variety of graph learning techniques can be recast as special cases of bilevel optimization or simplifications thereof. In brief, building on prior work we first derive a more flexible class of energy functions that, when paired with various descent steps (e.g., gradient descent, proximal methods, momentum, etc.), form graph neural network (GNN) message-passing layers; critically, we also carefully unpack where any residual approximation error lies with respect to the underlying constituent message-passing functions. We then probe several simplifications of this framework to derive close connections with non-GNN-based graph learning approaches, including knowledge graph embeddings, various forms of label propagation, and efficient graph-regularized MLP models. And finally, we present supporting empirical results that demonstrate the versatility of the proposed bilevel lens, which we refer to as BloomGML, referencing that BiLevel Optimization Offers More Graph Machine Learning.

We give a precise definition of the problem of robust sparse voting, highlight its underlying technical challenges, and present a novel voting mechanism addressing the problem. We prove that, using this mechanism, no voter can have more than a small parameterizable effect on each alternative's score; a property we call Lipschitz resilience. We also identify conditions of voters comparability under which any unanimous preferences can be recovered, even when each voter provides sparse scores, on a scale that is potentially very different from any other voter's score scale.

We empirically evaluate the effectiveness of our compression technique on matrix recovery problems. Remarkably, by using an initialization that exploits the structure of the problem, we observe that our compressed network converges faster than the original network, consistently yielding smaller recovery errors. We substantiate this observation by developing a theory focused on deep matrix factorization. Finally, we empirically demonstrate how our compressed model has the potential to improve the utility of deep nonlinear models. Overall, our algorithm improves the training efficiency by more than 2x, without compromising generalization",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Estimating the parameters of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) is of fundamental importance in many scientific applications. While ODEs are typically approximated with deterministic algorithms, new research on probabilistic solvers indicates that they produce more reliable parameter estimates by better accounting for numerical errors. However, many ODE systems are highly sensitive to their parameter values. This produces deep local maxima in the likelihood function – a problem which existing probabilistic solvers have yet to resolve. Here we present a novel probabilistic ODE likelihood approximation, DALTON, which can dramatically reduce parameter sensitivity by learning from noisy ODE measurements in a data-adaptive manner. Our approximation scales linearly in both ODE variables and time discretization points, and is applicable to ODEs with both partially-unobserved components and non-Gaussian measurement models. Several examples demonstrate that DALTON produces more accurate parameter estimates via numerical optimization than existing probabilistic ODE solvers, and even in some cases than the exact ODE likelihood itself",

    "abstract": "We study the constrained Markov decision processes (CMDPs), in which an agent aims to maximize the expected cumulative reward subject to a constraint on the expected total value of a utility function. Existing approaches have primarily focused on \\emph{soft} constraint violation, which allows compensation across episodes, making it easier to satisfy the constraints. In contrast, we consider a stronger \\emph{hard} constraint violation metric, where only positive constraint violations are accumulated. Our main result is the development of the \\emph{first model-free}, \\emph{simulator-free} algorithm that achieves a sub-linear regret and a sub-linear hard constraint violation simultaneously, even in \\emph{large-scale} systems. In particular, we show that $\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}(\\sqrt{d^3H^4K})$ regret and $\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}(\\sqrt{d^3H^4K})$ hard constraint violation bounds can be achieved, where $K$ is the number of episodes, $d$ is the dimension of the feature mapping, $H$ is the length of the episode. Our results are achieved via novel adaptations of the primal-dual LSVI-UCB algorithm, i.e., it searches for the dual variable that balances between regret and constraint violation within every episode, rather than updating it at the end of each episode. This turns out to be crucial for our theoretical guarantees when dealing with hard constraint violations",

The robust change detection problem is studied in an asymptotic setting where the mean time to false alarm goes to infinity. It is shown that the least favorable distribution (LFD) is an exponentially tilted version of the pre-change density and can be obtained efficiently.

Recent prompting works claim to elicit intermediate reasoning steps and key tokens that serve as proxy explanations for LLM predictions. However, there is no certainty whether these explanations are reliable and reflect the LLM's behavior. In this work, we make one of the first attempts at quantifying the uncertainty in explanations of LLMs. To this end, we propose two novel metrics — Verbalized Uncertainty and Probing Uncertainty — to quantify the uncertainty of generated explanations. While verbalized uncertainty involves prompting the LLM to express its confidence in its explanations, probing uncertainty leverages sample and model perturbations as a means to quantify the uncertainty. Our empirical analysis of benchmark datasets reveals that verbalized uncertainty is not a reliable estimate of explanation confidence. Further, we show that the probing uncertainty estimates are correlated with the faithfulness of an explanation, with lower uncertainty corresponding to explanations with higher faithfulness. Our study provides insights into the challenges and opportunities of quantifying uncertainty in LLM explanations, contributing to the broader discussion of the trustworthiness of foundation models",

We argue that the existence of the off-manifold attacks is a natural consequence of the dimension gap between the intrinsic and ambient dimensions of the data. For 2-layer ReLU networks, we prove that even though the dimension gap does not affect generalization performance on samples drawn from the observed data space, it makes the clean-trained model more vulnerable to adversarial perturbations in the off-manifold direction of the data space.

However, such information-theoretic uncertainty analysis fails to account for a widely believed property of uncertainty known as sensitivity between test and training data. This means that if the test data is similar to the training data in some sense, the uncertainty will be smaller. In this study, we study such sensitivity using a new decomposition of uncertainty.

However, actual interpretability requires to limit the number and size of the generated rules, and existing boosting variants are not designed for this purpose. Though corrective boosting refits all rule weights in each iteration to minimise prediction risk, the included rule conditions tend to be sub-optimal, because commonly used objective functions fail to anticipate this refitting. Here, we address this issue by a new objective function that measures the angle between the risk gradient vector and the projection of the condition output vector onto the orthogonal complement of the already selected conditions. This approach correctly approximates the ideal update of adding the risk gradient itself to the model and favours the inclusion of more general and thus shorter rules. As we demonstrate using a wide range of prediction tasks, this significantly improves the comprehensibility/accuracy trade-off of the fitted ensemble.

    "abstract": "Learning with rejection has been a prototypical model for studying the human-AI interaction on prediction tasks. Upon the arrival of a sample instance, the model first uses a rejector to decide whether to accept and use the AI predictor to make a prediction or reject and defer the sample to humans. Learning such a model changes the structure of the original loss function and often results in undesirable non-convexity and inconsistency issues. For the classification with rejection problem, several works develop consistent surrogate losses for the joint learning of the predictor and the rejector, while there have been fewer works for the regression counterpart. This paper studies the regression with rejection (RwR) problem and investigates a no-rejection learning strategy that uses all the data to learn the predictor. We first establish the consistency for such a strategy under the weak realizability condition. Then for the case without the weak realizability, we show that the excessive risk can also be upper bounded with the sum of two parts: prediction error and calibration error.

    "abstract": "Zeroth-order (ZO) methods, which use the finite difference of two function evaluations (also called ZO gradient) to approximate first-order gradient, have attracted much attention recently in machine learning because of their broad applications. The accuracy of the ZO gradient highly depends on how many finite differences are averaged, which are intrinsically determined by the number of perturbations randomly drawn from a distribution. Existing ZO methods try to learn a data-driven distribution for sampling the perturbations to improve the efficiency of ZO optimization (ZOO) algorithms. In this paper, we explore a new and parallel direction, \\textit{i.e.}, learn an optimal sampling policy instead of using a totally random strategy to generate perturbations based on the techniques of reinforcement learning (RL), which makes it possible to approximate the gradient with only two function evaluations. Specifically, we first formulate the problem of learning a sampling policy as a Markov decision process. Then, we propose our ZO-RL algorithm, \\textit{i.e.}, using deep deterministic policy gradient, an actor-critic RL algorithm to learn a sampling policy that can guide the generation of perturbed vectors in getting ZO gradients as accurately as possible. Importantly, the existing ZOO algorithms for learning a distribution can be plugged in to improve the exploration of ZO-RL. Experimental results with different ZO estimators show that our ZO-RL algorithm can effectively reduce the query complexity of ZOO algorithms and converge faster than existing ZOO algorithms, especially in the later stage of the optimization process",

Syntax is sample efficient as it (i) recruits and allocates patients adaptively and (ii) estimates treatment effects by forming synthetic controls for each subpopulation that combines control samples from other subpopulations.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Quantifying the difference between two probability density functions, $p$ and $q$, using available data, is a fundamental problem in Statistics and Machine Learning. A usual approach for addressing this problem is the likelihood-ratio estimation (LRE) between $p$ and $q$, which -to our best knowledge- has been investigated mainly for the offline case. This paper contributes by introducing a new framework for online non-parametric LRE (OLRE) for the setting where pairs of iid observations $(x_t \\sim p, x'_t \\sim q)$ are observed over time. The non-parametric nature of our approach has the advantage of being agnostic to the forms of $p$ and $q$. Moreover, we capitalize on the recent advances in Kernel Methods and functional minimization to develop an estimator that can be efficiently updated at every iteration. We provide theoretical guarantees for the performance of the OLRE method along with empirical validation in synthetic experiments",

    "abstract": "Recent studies highlight the effectiveness of Bayesian methods in assessing algorithm performance, particularly in fairness and bias evaluation. We present Uncertainty Matters, a multi-objective uncertainty-aware algorithmic comparison framework. In fairness focused scenarios, it models sensitive group confusion matrices using Bayesian updates and facilitates joint comparison of performance (e.g., accuracy) and fairness metrics (e.g., true positive rate parity). Our approach works seamlessly with common evaluation methods like K-fold cross-validation, effectively addressing dependencies among the K posterior metric distributions. The integration of correlated information is carried out through a procedure tailored to the classifier's complexity. Experiments demonstrate that the insights derived from algorithmic comparisons employing the Uncertainty Matters approach are more informative, reliable, and less influenced by particular data partitions.

    "abstract": "Byzantine robustness is an essential feature of algorithms for certain distributed optimization problems, typically encountered in collaborative/federated learning. These problems are usually huge-scale, implying that communication compression is also imperative for their resolution. These factors have spurred recent algorithmic and theoretical developments in the literature of Byzantine-robust learning with compression. In this paper, we contribute to this research area in two main directions. First, we propose a new Byzantine-robust method with compression – Byz-DASHA-PAGE – and prove that the new method has better convergence rate (for non-convex and Polyak-Lojasiewicz smooth optimization problems), smaller neighborhood size in the heterogeneous case, and tolerates more Byzantine workers under over-parametrization than the previous method with SOTA theoretical convergence guarantees (Byz-VR-MARINA). Secondly, we develop the first Byzantine-robust method with communication compression and error feedback – Byz-EF21 – along with its bi-directional compression version – Byz-EF21-BC – and derive the convergence rates for these methods for non-convex and Polyak-Lojasiewicz smooth case. We test the proposed methods and illustrate our theoretical findings in the numerical experiments",

More recent global large scale assessments such as PISA, or internet studies, may lead to significantly increased numbers of participants. Additionally, in the context of Machine Learning where algorithms take the role of examinees and data analysis problems take the role of items, both $n$ and $m$ may become very large, challenging the efficiency and scalability of computations. To learn the latent variables in IRT models from large data, we leverage the similarity of these models to logistic regression, which can be approximated accurately using small weighted subsets called coresets.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "In the context of kernel machines, polynomial and Fourier features are commonly used to provide a nonlinear extension to linear models by mapping the data to a higher-dimensional space. Unless one considers the dual formulation of the learning problem, which renders exact large-scale learning unfeasible, the exponential increase of model parameters in the dimensionality of the data caused by their tensor-product structure prohibits to tackle high-dimensional problems. One of the possible approaches to circumvent this exponential scaling is to exploit the tensor structure present in the features by constraining the model weights to be an underparametrized tensor network. In this paper we quantize, i.e. further tensorize, polynomial and Fourier features. Based on this feature quantization we propose to quantize the associated model weights, yielding quantized models. We show that, for the same number of model parameters, the resulting quantized models have a higher bound on the VC-dimension as opposed to their non-quantized counterparts, at no additional computational cost while learning from identical features. We verify experimentally how this additional tensorization regularizes the learning problem by prioritizing the most salient features in the data and how it provides models with increased generalization capabilities.

[SF]$^2$M interprets continuous-time stochastic generative modeling as a Schrödinger bridge problem. It relies on static entropy-regularized optimal transport, or a minibatch approximation, to efficiently learn the SB without simulating the learned stochastic process.

Traditionally, such datasets consist of inputs given as meshes with a large number of nodes representing the problem geometry (seen as graphs), and corresponding outputs obtained with a numerical solver. This means the supervised learning model must be able to handle large and sparse graphs with continuous node attributes. In this work, we focus on Gaussian process regression, for which we introduce the Sliced Wasserstein Weisfeiler-Lehman (SWWL) graph kernel. In contrast to existing graph kernels, the proposed SWWL kernel enjoys positive definiteness and a drastic complexity reduction, which makes it possible to process datasets that were previously impossible to handle. The new kernel is first validated on graph classification for molecular datasets, where the input graphs have a few tens of nodes. The efficiency of the SWWL kernel is then illustrated on graph regression in computational fluid dynamics and solid mechanics, where the input graphs are made up of tens of thousands of nodes",

Gaussian process models on manifolds have recently been proposed for such tasks, in particular when uncertainty quantification is needed. In the manifold setting, vector-valued signals can behave very differently from scalar-valued ones, with much of the progress so far focused on modeling the latter. The former, however, are crucial for many applications, such as modeling wind speeds or force fields of unknown dynamical systems. In this paper, we propose novel Gaussian process models for vector-valued signals on manifolds that are intrinsically defined and account for the geometry of the space in consideration. We provide computational primitives needed to deploy the resulting Hodge-Matérn Gaussian vector fields on the two-dimensional sphere and the hypertori. Further, we highlight two generalization directions: discrete two-dimensional meshes and \"ideal\" manifolds like hyperspheres, Lie groups, and homogeneous spaces.

To address these issues, we introduce a framework for robot motion planning based on variational Gaussian processes, which unifies and generalizes various probabilistic-inference-based motion planning algorithms, and connects them with optimization-based planners. Our framework provides a principled and flexible way to incorporate equality-based, inequality-based, and soft motion-planning constraints during end-to-end training, is straightforward to implement, and provides both interval-based and Monte-Carlo-based uncertainty estimates.

This is particularly challenging for strict safety requirements in GP methods, as it employs computationally expensive Monte Carlo sampling of high quantiles. We address these challenges by providing provable safety bounds based on the adaptively sampled median of the supremum of the posterior GP. Our method significantly reduces the number of samples required for estimating high safety probabilities, resulting in faster evaluation without sacrificing accuracy and exploration speed.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "The proliferation of decentralised electronic healthcare records (EHRs) across medical institutions requires innovative federated learning strategies for collaborative data analysis and global model training, prioritising data privacy. A prevalent issue during decentralised model training is the data-view discrepancies across medical institutions that arises from differences or availability of healthcare services, such as blood test panels. The prevailing way to handle this issue is to select a common subset of features across institutions to make data-views consistent. This approach, however, constrains some institutions to shed some critical features that may play a significant role in improving the model performance. This paper introduces a federated learning framework that relies on augmented graph attention networks to address data-view heterogeneity. The proposed framework utilises an alignment augmentation layer over self-attention mechanisms to weigh the importance of neighbouring nodes when updating a node's embedding irrespective of the data-views. Furthermore, our framework adeptly addresses both the temporal nuances and structural intricacies of EHR datasets. This dual capability not only offers deeper insights but also effectively encapsulates EHR graphs' time-evolving nature. Using diverse real-world datasets, we show that the proposed framework significantly outperforms conventional FL methodology for dealing with heterogeneous data-views",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Recently developed survival analysis methods improve upon existing approaches by predicting the probability of event occurrence in each of a number pre-specified (discrete) time intervals. By avoiding placing strong parametric assumptions on the event density, this approach tends to improve prediction performance, particularly when data are plentiful. However, in clinical settings with limited available data, it is often preferable to judiciously partition the event time space into a limited number of intervals well suited to the prediction task at hand. In this work, we develop Adaptive Discretization for Event PredicTion (ADEPT) to learn from data a set of cut points defining such a partition. We show that in two simulated datasets, we are able to recover intervals that match the underlying generative model. We then demonstrate improved prediction performance on three real-world observational datasets, including a large, newly harmonized stroke risk prediction dataset. Finally, we argue that our approach facilitates clinical decision-making by suggesting time intervals that are most appropriate for each task, in the sense that they facilitate more accurate risk prediction",

    "abstract": "We develop generalization error bounds for stochastic gradient descent (SGD) with label noise in non-convex settings under uniform dissipativity and smoothness conditions. Under a suitable choice of semimetric, we establish a contraction in Wasserstein distance of the label noise stochastic gradient flow that depends polynomially on the parameter dimension $d$. Using the framework of algorithmic stability, we derive time-independent generalisation error bounds for the discretized algorithm with a constant learning rate. The error bound we achieve scales polynomially with $d$ and with the rate of $n^{-2/3}$, where $n$ is the sample size. This rate is better than the best-known rate of $n^{-1/2}$ established for stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics (SGLD)—which employs parameter-independent Gaussian noise—under similar conditions.

In this paper, we develop a novel Adaptive Parametric Prototype Learning (APPL) method under the meta-learning convention for cross-domain few-shot classification. Different from existing prototypical few-shot methods that use the averages of support instances to calculate the class prototypes, we propose to learn class prototypes from the concatenated features of the support set in a parametric fashion and meta-learn the model by enforcing prototype-based regularization on the query set. In addition, we fine-tune the model in the target domain in a transductive manner using a weighted-moving-average self-training approach on the query instances. We conduct experiments on multiple cross-domain few-shot benchmark datasets.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Machine learning methods have significantly improved in their predictive capabilities, but at the same time they are becoming more complex and less transparent. As a result, explainers are often relied on to provide interpretability to these black-box prediction models. As crucial diagnostics tools, it is important that these explainers themselves are robust. In this paper we focus on one particular aspect of robustness, namely that an explainer should give similar explanations for similar data inputs. We formalize this notion by introducing and defining explainer astuteness, analogous to astuteness of prediction functions. Our formalism allows us to connect explainer robustness to the predictor's probabilistic Lipschitzness, which captures the probability of local smoothness of a function. We provide lower bound guarantees on the astuteness of a variety of explainers (e.g., SHAP, RISE, CXPlain) given the Lipschitzness of the prediction function. These theoretical results imply that locally smooth prediction functions lend themselves to locally robust explanations. We evaluate these results empirically on simulated as well as real datasets",

    "abstract": "The Stochastic Gradient Langevin Dynamics (SGLD) are popularly used to approximate Bayesian posterior distributions in statistical learning procedures with large-scale data. As opposed to many usual Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms, SGLD is not stationary with respect to the posterior distribution; two sources of error appear: The first error is introduced by an Euler–Maruyama discretisation of a Langevin diffusion process, the second error comes from the data subsampling that enables its use in large-scale data settings. In this work, we consider an idealised version of SGLD to analyse the method's pure subsampling error that we then see as a best-case error for diffusion-based subsampling MCMC methods. Indeed, we introduce and study the Stochastic Gradient Langevin Diffusion (SGLDiff), a continuous-time Markov process that follows the Langevin diffusion corresponding to a data subset and switches this data subset after exponential waiting times. There, we show the exponential ergodicity of SLGDiff and that the Wasserstein distance between the posterior and the limiting distribution of SGLDiff is bounded above by a fractional power of the mean waiting time.

To address this gap, our work delves into an extensive examination of the privacy analysis of FL when used for training LLMs, both from theoretical and practical perspectives. In particular, we design two active membership inference attacks with guaranteed theoretical success rates to assess the privacy leakages of various adapted FL configurations. Our theoretical findings are translated into practical attacks, revealing substantial privacy vulnerabilities in popular LLMs, including BERT, RoBERTa, DistilBERT, and OpenAI's GPTs, across multiple real-world language datasets.

Here, we show that MPNNs can simulate standard interior-point methods for LPs, explaining their practical success. Furthermore, we highlight how MPNNs can serve as a lightweight proxy for solving LPs, adapting to a given problem instance distribution.

    "abstract": "Medical image segmentation typically demands extensive dense annotations for model training, which is both time-consuming and skill-intensive. To mitigate this burden, exemplar-based medical image segmentation methods have been introduced to achieve effective training with only one annotated image. In this paper, we introduce a novel Cross-model Mutual learning framework for Exemplar-based Medical image Segmentation (CMEMS), which leverages two models to mutually excavate implicit information from unlabeled data at multiple granularities. CMEMS can eliminate confirmation bias and enable collaborative training to learn complementary information by enforcing consistency at different granularities across models. Concretely, cross-model image perturbation based mutual learning is devised by using weakly perturbed images to generate high-confidence pseudo-labels, supervising predictions of strongly perturbed images across models. This approach enables joint pursuit of prediction consistency at the image granularity. Moreover, cross-model multi-level feature perturbation based mutual learning is designed by letting pseudo-labels supervise predictions from perturbed multi-level features with different resolutions, which can broaden the perturbation space and enhance the robustness of our framework. CMEMS is jointly trained using exemplar data, synthetic data, and unlabeled data in an end-to-end manner. Experimental results on two medical image datasets indicate that the proposed CMEMS outperforms the state-of-the-art segmentation methods with extremely limited supervision",

Maintaining calibration, however, can be challenging when the data is non-stationary and depends on our actions. We propose using simple algorithms based on online learning to provably maintain calibration on non-i.i.d. data, and we show how to integrate these algorithms in Bayesian optimization with minimal overhead.

We characterize settings where consistent value estimates are provably not achievable, and provide algorithms with guarantees to instead estimate lower bounds on the value. When consistent estimates are achievable, we provide algorithms for value estimation with sample complexity guarantees. We also present new algorithms for offline policy improvement and prove local convergence guarantees.

    "abstract": "Robustness to out-of-distribution (OOD) samples is crucial for the safe deployment of machine learning models in the open world. Recent works have focused on designing scoring functions to quantify OOD uncertainty. Setting appropriate thresholds for these scoring functions for OOD detection is challenging as OOD samples are often unavailable up front. Typically, thresholds are set to achieve a desired true positive rate (TPR), e.g., $95%$ TPR. However, this can lead to very high false positive rates (FPR), ranging from 60 to 96%, as observed in the Open-OOD benchmark. In safety critical real-life applications, e.g., medical diagnosis, controlling the FPR is essential when dealing with various OOD samples dynamically. To address these challenges, we propose a mathematically grounded OOD detection framework that leverages expert feedback to \\emph{safely} update the threshold on the fly. We provide theoretical results showing that it is guaranteed to meet the FPR constraint at all times while minimizing the use of human feedback. Another key feature of our framework is that it can work with any scoring function for OOD uncertainty quantification. Empirical evaluation of our system on synthetic and benchmark OOD datasets shows that our method can maintain FPR at most $5%$ while maximizing TPR",

Their output is obtained by adding noise to a sequence of low-sensitivity queries and reporting the identity of the query whose (noisy) answer satisfies a certain condition. Pure DP guarantees for these mechanisms are easy to obtain when Laplace noise is added to the queries. On the other hand, when instantiated using Gaussian noise, standard analyses only yield approximate DP guarantees despite the fact that the outputs of these mechanisms lie in a discrete space. In this work, we revisit the analysis of Report Noisy Max and Above Threshold with Gaussian noise and show that, under the additional assumption that the underlying queries are bounded, it is possible to provide pure ex-ante DP bounds for Report Noisy Max and pure ex-post DP bounds for Above Threshold. The resulting bounds are tight and depend on closed-form expressions that can be numerically evaluated using standard methods. Empirically we find these lead to tighter privacy accounting in the high privacy, low data regime. Further, we propose a simple privacy filter for composing pure ex-post DP guarantees, and use it to derive a fully adaptive Gaussian Sparse Vector Technique mechanism.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "From the social sciences to machine learning, it is well documented that metrics do not always align with social welfare. In healthcare, Dranove et al. (2003) showed that publishing surgery mortality metrics actually harmed sicker patients by increasing provider selection behavior. Using a principal-agent model, we analyze the incentive misalignments that arise from such average treated outcome metrics, and show that the incentives driving treatment decisions would align with maximizing total patient welfare if the metrics (i) accounted for counterfactual untreated outcomes and (ii) considered total welfare instead of averaging over treated patients. Operationalizing this, we show how counterfactual metrics can be modified to behave reasonably in patient-facing ranking systems. Extending to realistic settings when providers observe more about patients than the regulatory agencies do, we bound the decay in performance by the degree of information asymmetry between principal and agent. In doing so, our model connects principal-agent information asymmetry with unobserved heterogeneity in causal inference",

    "abstract": "We consider model selection for sequential decision making in stochastic environments with bandit feedback, where a meta-learner has at its disposal a pool of base learners, and decides on the fly which action to take based on the policies recommended by each base learner. Model selection is performed by regret balancing but, unlike the recent literature on this subject, we do not assume any prior knowledge about the base learners like candidate regret guarantees; instead, we uncover these quantities in a data-driven manner. The meta-learner is therefore able to leverage the *realized* regret incurred by each base learner for the learning environment at hand (as opposed to the *expected* regret), and single out the best such regret. We design two model selection algorithms operating with this more ambitious notion of regret and, besides proving model selection guarantees via regret balancing, we experimentally demonstrate the compelling practical benefits of dealing with actual regrets instead of candidate regret bounds",

    "title": "Integrating Uncertainty Awareness into Conformalized Quantile Regression",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Conformalized Quantile Regression (CQR) is a recently proposed method for constructing prediction intervals for a response $Y$ given covariates $X$, without making distributional assumptions. However, existing constructions of CQR can be ineffective for problems where the quantile regressors perform better in certain parts of the feature space than others. The reason is that the prediction intervals of CQR do not distinguish between two forms of uncertainty: first, the variability of the conditional distribution of $Y$ given $X$ (i.e., aleatoric uncertainty), and second, our uncertainty in estimating this conditional distribution (i.e., epistemic uncertainty). This can lead to intervals that are overly narrow in regions where epistemic uncertainty is high. To address this, we propose a new variant of the CQR methodology, Uncertainty-Aware CQR (UACQR), that explicitly separates these two sources of uncertainty to adjust quantile regressors differentially across the feature space. Compared to CQR, our methods enjoy the same distribution-free theoretical coverage guarantees, while demonstrating in our experiments stronger conditional coverage properties in simulated settings and real-world data sets alike",

This models, for instance, scenarios where each arm itself represents an optimization algorithm for finding the minimizer of a common function, and there is a limited time available to test the algorithms before committing to one of them. We assume that the decreasing expected loss of each arm depends on the number of its pulls as a (inverse) polynomial with unknown coefficients. We propose two fixed-budget best arm identification algorithms – one for the case of sparse polynomial decay models and the other for general polynomial models – along with bounds on the identification error probability. We also derive algorithm-independent lower bounds on the error probability. These bounds are seen to be factored into the product of the usual problem complexity and the model complexity that only depends on the parameters of the model. This indicates that our methods can identify the best arm even when the budget is smaller. We conduct empirical studies of our algorithms to complement our theoretical findings",

We then show that simple modifications – such as pre-pulling all arms a fixed number of times, increasing the sampling variance – can provide tighter privacy guarantees. We again provide privacy guarantees that now depend on the new parameters introduced in the modification, which allows the analyst to tune the privacy guarantee as desired. We also provide a novel regret analysis for this new algorithm, and show how the new parameters also impact expected regret. Finally, we empirically validate and illustrate our theoretical findings in two parameter regimes and demonstrate that tuning the new parameters substantially improve the privacy-regret tradeoff",

But in many real-world $A/B/n$ multivariate testing scenarios that motivate our work, the environment is non-stationary and an algorithm expecting a stationary setting can easily fail. For robust identification, it is well-known that if arms are chosen randomly and non-adaptively from a G-optimal design over $\\mathcal{X}$ at each time then the error probability decreases as $\\exp(-T\\Delta^2_{(1)}/d)$, where $\\Delta_{(1)} = \\min_{x \\neq x^*} (x^* - x)^\\top \\frac{1}{T}\\sum_{t=1}^T \\theta_t$. As there exist environments where $\\Delta_{(1)}^2/ d \\ll 1/ \\rho^*$, we are motivated to propose a novel algorithm P1-RAGE that aims to obtain the best of both worlds: robustness to non-stationarity and fast rates of identification in benign settings.

This penalty enables us to build a computationally efficient group-level in-processing fairness-aware training framework. Empirical evidence shows that our framework enjoys better utility and fairness measures on popular benchmark data sets than competing methods.

    "abstract": "Matrix sensing problems exhibit pervasive non-convexity, plaguing optimization with a proliferation of suboptimal spurious solutions. Avoiding convergence to these critical points poses a major challenge. This work provides new theoretical insights that help demystify the intricacies of the non-convex landscape. In this work, we prove that under certain conditions, critical points sufficiently distant from the ground truth matrix exhibit favorable geometry by being strict saddle points rather than troublesome local minima. Moreover, we introduce the notion of higher-order losses for the matrix sensing problem and show that the incorporation of such losses into the objective function amplifies the negative curvature around those distant critical points. This implies that increasing the complexity of the objective function via high-order losses accelerates the escape from such critical points and acts as a desirable alternative to increasing the complexity of the optimization problem via over-parametrization. By elucidating key characteristics of the non-convex optimization landscape, this work makes progress towards a comprehensive framework for tackling broader machine learning objectives plagued by non-convexity",

In this work, we present FedFisher, a novel algorithm for one-shot FL that makes use of Fisher information matrices computed on local client models, motivated by a Bayesian perspective of FL. First, we theoretically analyze FedFisher for two-layer over-parameterized ReLU neural networks and show that the error of our one-shot FedFisher global model becomes vanishingly small as the width of the neural networks and amount of local training at clients increases. Next, we propose practical variants of FedFisher using the diagonal Fisher and K-FAC approximation for the full Fisher and highlight their communication and compute efficiency for FL.

However, existing average reward RL algorithms with sample complexity guarantees are not feasible, as they take as input the (unknown) mixing time of the Markov decision process (MDP). In this paper, we make initial progress towards addressing this open problem. We design a feasible average-reward $Q$-learning framework that requires no knowledge of any problem parameter as input. Our framework is based on discounted $Q$-learning, while we dynamically adapt the discount factor (and hence the effective horizon) to progressively approximate the average reward. In the synchronous setting, we solve three tasks: (i) learn a policy that is $\\epsilon$-close to optimal, (ii) estimate optimal average reward with $\\epsilon$-accuracy, and (iii) estimate the bias function (similar to $Q$-function in discounted case) with $\\epsilon$-accuracy. We show that with carefully designed adaptation schemes, (i) can be achieved with $\\tilde{O}(\\frac{SA t_{\\mathrm{mix}}^{8}}{\\epsilon^{8}})$ samples, (ii) with $\\tilde{O}(\\frac{SA t_{\\mathrm{mix}}^5}{\\epsilon^5})$ samples, and (iii) with $\\tilde{O}(\\frac{SA B}{\\epsilon^9})$ samples, where $t_\\mathrm{mix}$ is the mixing time, and $B > 0$ is an MDP-dependent constant. To our knowledge, we provide the first finite-sample guarantees that are polynomial in $S, A, t_{\\mathrm{mix}}, \\epsilon$ for a feasible variant of $Q$-learning. That said, the sample complexity bounds have tremendous room for improvement, which we leave for the community's best minds.

These empirical successes raise the theoretical question of whether score-based diffusion models can optimally adapt to low-dimensional manifold structures. While recent work has validated the minimax optimality of diffusion models when the target distribution admits a smooth density with respect to the Lebesgue measure of the ambient data space, these findings do not fully account for the ability of diffusion models in avoiding the the curse of dimensionality when estimating high-dimensional distributions. This work considers two common classes of diffusion models: Langevin diffusion and forward-backward diffusion. We show that both models can adapt to the intrinsic manifold structure by showing that the convergence rate of the inducing distribution estimator depends only on the intrinsic dimension of the data. Moreover, our considered estimator does not require knowing or explicitly estimating the manifold.

This complexity is at odds with the popular and simple Thompson Sampling algorithm for regret minimization, which just requires access to a posterior sampling and argmax oracle, and does not need to enumerate $\\mathcal{Z}$ at any point. Unfortunately, Thompson sampling is known to be sub-optimal for pure exploration. In this work, we pose a natural question: is there an algorithm that can explore optimally and only needs the same computational primitives as Thompson Sampling? We answer the question in the affirmative. We provide an algorithm that leverages only sampling and argmax oracles and achieves an exponential convergence rate, with the exponent equal to the exponent of the optimal fixed allocation asymptotically. In addition, we show that our algorithm can be easily implemented and performs as well empirically as existing asymptotically optimal methods",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Contextual Markov decision processes (CMDPs) describe a class of reinforcement learning problems in which the transition kernels and reward functions can change over time with different MDPs indexed by a context variable. While CMDPs serve as an important framework to model many real-world applications with time-varying environments, they are largely unexplored from theoretical perspective. In this paper, we study CMDPs under two linear function approximation models: Model I with context-varying representations and common linear weights for all contexts; and Model II with common representations for all contexts and context-varying linear weights. For both models, we propose novel model-based algorithms and show that they enjoy guaranteed $\\epsilon$-suboptimality gap with desired polynomial sample complexity. In particular, instantiating our result for the first model to the tabular CMDP improves the existing result by removing the reachability assumption. Our result for the second model is the first-known result for such a type of function approximation models. Comparison between our results for the two models further indicates that having context-varying features leads to much better sample efficiency than having common representations for all contexts under linear CMDPs",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Personalization of machine learning (ML) predictions for individual users/domains/enterprises is critical for practical recommendation systems. Standard personalization approaches involve learning a user/domain specific \\emph{embedding} that is fed into a fixed global model which can be limiting. On the other hand, personalizing/fine-tuning model itself for each user/domain — a.k.a meta-learning — has high storage/infrastructure cost. Moreover, rigorous theoretical studies of scalable personalization approaches have been very limited. To address the above issues, we propose a novel meta-learning style approach that models network weights as a sum of low-rank and sparse components. This captures common information from multiple individuals/users together in the low-rank part while sparse part captures user-specific idiosyncrasies. We then study the framework in the linear setting, where the problem reduces to that of estimating the sum of a rank-$r$ and a $k$-column sparse matrix using a small number of linear measurements. We propose a computationally efficient alternating minimization method with iterative hard thresholding — AMHT-LRS — to learn the low-rank and sparse part. Theoretically, for the realizable Gaussian data setting, we show that AMHT-LRS solves the problem efficiently with nearly optimal sample complexity. Finally, a significant challenge in personalization is ensuring privacy of each user's sensitive data. We alleviate this problem by proposing a differentially private variant of our method that also is equipped with strong generalization guarantees",

Existing preference learning approaches assume homogeneity and focus on learning preference on average over the population or require a large number of queries per individual to localize individual preferences. However, in practical scenarios with heterogeneous preferences and limited availability of responses, these approaches are impractical. Therefore, we introduce the problem of learning the distribution of preferences over a population via pairwise comparisons using only one response per individual. Due to binary answers from comparison queries, we focus on learning the mass of the underlying distribution in the regions created by the intersection of bisecting hyperplanes between queried item pairs. We investigate this fundamental question in both 1-D and higher dimensional settings with noiseless response to comparison queries. We show that the problem is identifiable in 1-D setting and provide recovery guarantees. We show that the problem is not identifiable for higher dimensional settings in general and establish sufficient condition for identifiability. We propose using a regularized recovery, and provide guarantees on the total variation distance between the true mass and the learned distribution. We validate our findings through simulations and experiments on real datasets. We also introduce a new dataset for this task collected on a real crowdsourcing platform",

It is composed of Bidirectional Transformer of Architecture and Performance (Bi-Arch2Perf) and Neural Architecture Conditional Generation (NACG). Bi-Arch2Perf is developed to learn the joint distribution of architecture and performance from bidirectional conditional distribution through the adversarial training of the discriminator, the architecture generator, and the performance predictor. Then, the incorporation of semi-supervised learning optimizes the construction of Bi-Arch2Perf by utilizing a large amount of architecture information without performance annotation in search space. Based on the learned bidirectional relationship, the performance of architecture is predicted by NACG in high-performance architecture space to efficiently discover well-promising neural architectures. The experimental results on NAS benchmarks demonstrate that SemiGAN-NAD achieves competitive performance with reduced evaluation time compared with the latest NAS methods.

    "abstract": "Contrastive learning has emerged as a prominent branch of self-supervised learning for several years. Especially, CLIP, which applies contrastive learning to large sets of captioned images, has garnered significant attention. Recently, SigLIP, a variant of CLIP, has been proposed, which uses the sigmoid loss instead of the standard InfoNCE loss. SigLIP achieves the performance comparable to CLIP in a more efficient manner by eliminating the need for a global view. However, theoretical understanding of using the sigmoid loss in contrastive learning is underexplored. In this paper, we provide a theoretical analysis of using the sigmoid loss in contrastive learning, in the perspective of the geometric structure of learned embeddings. First, we propose the double-Constant Embedding Model (CCEM), a framework for parameterizing various well-known embedding structures by a single variable. Interestingly, the proposed CCEM is proven to contain the optimal embedding with respect to the sigmoid loss. Second, we mathematically analyze the optimal embedding minimizing the sigmoid loss for contrastive learning. The optimal embedding ranges from simplex equiangular-tight-frame to antipodal structure, depending on the temperature parameter used in the sigmoid loss. Third, our experimental results on synthetic datasets coincide with the theoretical results on the optimal embedding structures",

However, existing TLRR methods consider Gaussian or gross sparse noise, inevitably leading to performance degradation when the tensor data are contaminated by outliers or sample-specific corruptions. This paper develops an outlier-robust tensor low-rank representation (OR-TLRR) method that provides outlier detection and tensor data clustering simultaneously based on the t-SVD framework. For tensor observations with arbitrary outlier corruptions, OR-TLRR has provable performance guarantee for exactly recovering the row space of clean data and detecting outliers under mild conditions. Moreover, an extension of OR-TLRR is proposed to handle the case when parts of the data are missing.

Existing robust SVD algorithms often sacrifice speed for robustness or fail in the presence of only a few outliers. This study introduces an efficient algorithm, called Spherically Normalized SVD, for robust SVD approximation that is highly insensitive to outliers, computationally scalable, and provides accurate approximations of singular vectors. The proposed algorithm achieves remarkable speed by utilizing only two applications of a standard reduced-rank SVD algorithm to appropriately scaled data, significantly outperforming competing algorithms in computation times. To assess the robustness of the approximated singular vectors and their subspaces against data contamination, we introduce new notions of breakdown points for matrix-valued input, including row-wise, column-wise, and block-wise breakdown points. Theoretical and empirical analyses demonstrate that our algorithm exhibits higher breakdown points compared to standard SVD and its modifications. We empirically validate the effectiveness of our approach in applications such as robust low-rank approximation and robust principal component analysis of high-dimensional microarray datasets. Overall, our study presents a highly efficient and robust solution for SVD approximation that overcomes the limitations of existing algorithms in the presence of outliers",

We study one such approach, which resembles an extension of Stein variational gradient descent, establishing a descent lemma which guarantees that the free energy decreases at each iteration. This method, and any other obtained as the discretization of the gradient flow, necessarily depends on a learning rate which must be carefully tuned by the practitioner in order to ensure convergence at a suitable rate. With this in mind, we also propose another algorithm for optimizing the free energy which is entirely learning rate free, based on coin betting techniques from convex optimization.

While these models can also account for aleatoric uncertainty, there is still a lack of work on accounting for epistemic uncertainty. In this paper, we address this problem by presenting a Bayesian approximation for semi-structured regression models using subspace inference. To this end, we extend subspace inference for joint posterior sampling from a full parameter space for structured effects and a subspace for unstructured effects. Apart from this hybrid sampling scheme, our method allows for tunable complexity of the subspace and can capture multiple minima in the loss landscape.

    "title": "Structural perspective on constraint-based learning of Markov networks",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Markov networks are probabilistic graphical models that employ undirected graphs to depict conditional independence relationships among variables. Our focus lies in constraint-based structure learning, which entails learning the undirected graph from data through the execution of conditional independence tests. We establish theoretical limits concerning two critical aspects of constraint-based learning of Markov networks: the number of tests and the sizes of the conditioning sets. These bounds uncover an exciting interplay between the structural properties of the graph and the amount of tests required to learn a Markov network. The starting point of our work is that the graph parameter maximum pairwise connectivity, $\\kappa$, that is, the maximum number of vertex-disjoint paths connecting a pair of vertices in the graph, is responsible for the sizes of independence tests required to learn the graph. On one hand, we show that at least one test with the size of the conditioning set at least $\\kappa$ is always necessary. On the other hand, we prove that any graph can be learned by performing tests of size at most $\\kappa$. This completely resolves the question of the minimum size of conditioning sets required to learn the graph. When it comes to the number of tests, our upper bound on the sizes of conditioning sets implies that every $n$-vertex graph can be learned by at most $n^{\\kappa}$ tests with conditioning sets of sizes at most $\\kappa$. We show that for any upper bound q on the sizes of the conditioning sets, there exist graphs with $O(nq)$ vertices that require at least $n^{\\Omega(\\kappa)}$ tests to learn. This lower bound holds even when the treewidth and the maximum degree of the graph are at most $\\kappa+2$. On the positive side, we prove that every graph of bounded treewidth can be learned by a polynomial number of tests with conditioning sets of sizes at most $2*\\kappa$",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Identification and appropriate handling of inconsistencies in data at deployment time is crucial to reliably use machine learning models. While recent data-centric methods are able to identify such inconsistencies with respect to the training set, they suffer from two key limitations: (1) suboptimality in settings where features exhibit statistical independencies, due to their usage of compressive representations and (2) lack of localization to pin-point why a sample might be flagged as inconsistent, which is important to guide future data collection. We solve these two fundamental limitations using directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) to encode the training set's features probability distribution and independencies as a structure. Our method, called DAGnosis, leverages these structural interactions to bring valuable and insightful data-centric conclusions. DAGnosis unlocks the localization of the causes of inconsistencies on a DAG, an aspect overlooked by previous approaches. Moreover, we show empirically that leveraging these interactions (1) leads to more accurate conclusions in detecting inconsistencies, as well as (2) provides more detailed insights into why some samples are flagged",

By finding a mean in this embedding space, we can recover a mean graph that preserves structural information. We establish the existence and uniqueness of the novel graph mean, and provide an iterative algorithm for computing it. To highlight the potential of our framework as a valuable tool for practical applications in machine learning, it is evaluated on various tasks, including k-means clustering of structured aligned graphs, classification of functional brain networks, and semi-supervised node classification in multi-layer graphs.

Central to the study of SciSci has been the analysis of citation networks. Here, two prominent modeling methodologies have been employed: one is to assess the citation impact dynamics of papers using parametric distributions, and the other is to embed the citation networks in a latent space optimal for characterizing the static relations between papers in terms of their citations. Interestingly, citation networks are a prominent example of single-event dynamic networks, i.e., networks for which each dyad only has a single event (i.e., the point in time of citation). We presently propose a novel likelihood function for the characterization of such single-event networks. Using this likelihood, we propose the Dynamic Impact Single-Event Embedding model (DISEE). The DISEE model characterizes the scientific interactions in terms of a latent distance model in which random effects account for citation heterogeneity while the time-varying impact is characterized using existing parametric representations for assessment of dynamic impact. We highlight the proposed approach on several real citation networks finding that DISEE well reconciles static latent distance network embedding approaches with classical dynamic impact assessments",

This is especially evident when using deep neural networks for time series prediction and classification: real-world time series data often exhibit irregularities such as multi-modality, skewness and outliers, and the model performance can degrade rapidly if these characteristics are not adequately addressed. In this work, we propose the EDAIN (Extended Deep Adaptive Input Normalization) layer, a novel adaptive neural layer that learns how to appropriately normalize irregular time series data for a given task in an end-to-end fashion, instead of using a fixed normalization scheme. This is achieved by optimizing its unknown parameters simultaneously with the deep neural network using back-propagation. Our experiments, conducted using synthetic data, a credit default prediction dataset, and a large-scale limit order book benchmark dataset, demonstrate the superior performance of the EDAIN layer when compared to conventional normalization methods and existing adaptive time series preprocessing layers",

In this paper, we show that the RIP can still be achieved with high probability, when the rank-one measurement matrix is constructed by the random unit-modulus vectors. Compared to the existing works, we first address the challenge of establishing RIP for the linear map in non-i.i.d. scenarios.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Variational autoencoders (VAEs) face a notorious problem wherein the variational posterior often aligns closely with the prior, a phenomenon known as posterior collapse, which hinders the quality of representation learning. To mitigate this problem, an adjustable hyperparameter $\\beta$ and a strategy for annealing this parameter, called KL annealing, are proposed. This study presents a theoretical analysis of the learning dynamics in a minimal VAE. It is rigorously proved that the dynamics converge to a deterministic process within the limit of large input dimensions, thereby enabling a detailed dynamical analysis of the generalization error. Furthermore, the analysis shows that the VAE initially learns entangled representations and gradually acquires disentangled representations. A fixed-point analysis of the deterministic process reveals that when $\\beta$ exceeds a certain threshold, posterior collapse becomes inevitable regardless of the learning period. Additionally, the superfluous latent variables for the data-generative factors lead to overfitting of the background noise; this adversely affects both generalization and learning convergence. The analysis further unveiled that appropriately tuned KL annealing can accelerate convergence",

In this paper, we aim to factor in moral scores by adding a constraint to the RL objective that is incorporated during training, thereby dynamically adapting the policy function.

    "abstract": "Calibration of machine learning classifiers is necessary to obtain reliable and interpretable predictions, bridging the gap between model outputs and actual probabilities. One prominent technique, isotonic regression (IR), aims at calibrating binary classifiers by minimizing the cross entropy with respect to monotone transformations. IR acts as an adaptive binning procedure that is able to achieve a calibration error of zero but leaves open the issue of the effect on performance. We first prove that IR preserves the convex hull of the ROC curve—an essential performance metric for binary classifiers. This ensures that a classifier is calibrated while controlling for over-fitting of the calibration set. We then present a novel generalization of isotonic regression to accommodate classifiers with $K$-classes. Our method constructs a multidimensional adaptive binning scheme on the probability simplex, again achieving a multi-class calibration error equal to zero. We regularize this algorithm by imposing a form of monotony that preserves the $K$-dimensional ROC surface of the classifier. We show empirically that this general monotony criterion is effective in striking a balance between reducing cross entropy loss and avoiding over-fitting of the calibration set",

    "abstract": "The XAI Disagreement Problem concerns the fact that various explainability methods yield different local/global insights on model behavior. Thus, given the lack of ground truth in explainability, practitioners are left wondering \"Which explanation should I believe?\". In this work, we approach the Disagreement Problem from the point of view of Functional Decomposition (FD). First, we demonstrate that many XAI techniques disagree because they handle feature interactions differently. Secondly, we reduce interactions locally by fitting a so-called FD-Tree, which partitions the input space into regions where the model is approximately additive. Thus instead of providing global explanations aggregated over the whole dataset, we advocate reporting the FD-Tree structure as well as the regional explanations extracted from its leaves. The beneficial effects of FD-Trees on the Disagreement Problem are demonstrated on toy and real datasets",

    "title": "Training Implicit Generative Models via an Invariant Statistical Loss",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Implicit generative models have the capability to learn arbitrary complex data distributions. On the downside, training requires telling apart real data from artificially-generated ones using adversarial discriminators, leading to unstable training and mode-dropping issues. As reported by Zahee et al. (2017), even in the one-dimensional (1D) case, training a generative adversarial network (GAN) is challenging and often suboptimal. In this work, we develop a discriminator-free method for training one-dimensional (1D) generative implicit models and subsequently expand this method to accommodate multivariate cases. Our loss function is a discrepancy measure between a suitably chosen transformation of the model samples and a uniform distribution; hence, it is invariant with respect to the true distribution of the data. We first formulate our method for 1D random variables, providing an effective solution for approximate reparameterization of arbitrary complex distributions. Then, we consider the temporal setting (both univariate and multivariate), in which we model the conditional distribution of each sample given the history of the process. We demonstrate through numerical simulations that this new method yields promising results, successfully learning true distributions in a variety of scenarios and mitigating some of the well-known problems that state-of-the-art implicit methods present",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Efficiently learning equilibria with large state and action spaces in general-sum Markov games while overcoming the curse of multi-agency is a challenging problem. Recent works have attempted to solve this problem by employing independent linear function classes to approximate the marginal $Q$-value for each agent. However, existing sample complexity bounds under such a framework have a suboptimal dependency on the desired accuracy $\\varepsilon$ or the action space. In this work, we introduce a new algorithm, Lin-Confident-FTRL, for learning coarse correlated equilibria (CCE) with local access to the simulator, i.e., one can interact with the underlying environment on the visited states. Up to a logarithmic dependence on the size of the state space, Lin-Confident-FTRL learns $\\epsilon$-CCE with a provable optimal accuracy bound $O(\\epsilon^{-2})$ and gets rids of the linear dependency on the action space, while scaling polynomially with relevant problem parameters (such as the number of agents and time horizon). Moreover, our analysis of Linear-Confident-FTRL generalizes the virtual policy iteration technique in the single-agent local planning literature, which yields a new computationally efficient algorithm with a tighter sample complexity bound when assuming random access to the simulator",

Through carefully balancing the reuse of past samples and exploration of new samples, we then extend the results to Markov potential games and improve the best available Nash regret from $O(T^{5/6})$ to $O(T^{4/5})$.

However, the current theoretical understanding of the role of the target divergence in the characteristics of GANs' generated samples remains largely inadequate. In this work, we aim to analyze the influence of the divergence measure on the local optima and convergence properties of divergence minimization problems in learning a multi-modal data distribution. We show a mode-seeking f-divergence, e.g. the Jensen-Shannon (JS) divergence in the vanilla GAN, could lead to poor locally optimal solutions missing some underlying modes. On the other hand, we demonstrate that the optimization landscape of 1-Wasserstein distance in Wasserstein GANs does not suffer from such suboptimal local minima. Furthermore, we prove that a randomly-initialized gradient-based optimization of the Wasserstein distance will, with high probability, capture all the existing modes. We present numerical results on standard image datasets, revealing the success of Wasserstein GANs compared to JS-GANs in avoiding suboptimal local optima under a mixture model",

    "abstract": "Even if a model is not globally sparse, it is possible for decisions made from that model to be accurately and faithfully described by a small number of features. For instance, an application for a large loan might be denied to someone because they have no credit history, which overwhelms any evidence towards their creditworthiness. In this work, we introduce the Sparse Explanation Value (SEV), a new way of measuring sparsity in machine learning models. In the loan denial example above, the SEV is 1 because only one factor is needed to explain why the loan was denied. SEV is a measure of decision sparsity rather than overall model sparsity, and we are able to show that many machine learning models – even if they are not sparse – actually have low decision sparsity, as measured by SEV. SEV is defined using movements over a hypercube, allowing SEV to be defined consistently over various model classes, with movement restrictions reflecting real-world constraints. Our algorithms reduce SEV without sacrificing accuracy, providing sparse and completely faithful explanations, even without globally sparse models",

    "abstract": "Standard probabilistic sparse coding assumes a Laplace prior, a linear mapping from latents to observables, and Gaussian observable distributions. We here derive a solely entropy-based learning objective for the parameters of standard sparse coding. The novel variational objective has the following features: (A) unlike MAP approximations, it uses non-trivial posterior approximations for probabilistic inference; (B) the novel objective is fully analytic; and (C) the objective allows for a novel principled form of annealing. The objective is derived by first showing that the standard ELBO objective converges to a sum of entropies, which matches similar recent results for generative models with Gaussian priors. The conditions under which the ELBO becomes equal to entropies are then shown to have analytic solutions, which leads to the fully analytic objective. Numerical experiments are used to demonstrate the feasibility of learning with such entropy-based ELBOs. We investigate different posterior approximations including Gaussians with correlated latents and deep amortized approximations. Furthermore, we numerically investigate entropy-based annealing which results in improved learning. Our main contributions are theoretical, however, and they are twofold: (1) we provide the first demonstration on how a recently shown convergence of the ELBO to entropy sums can be used for learning; and (2) using the entropy objective, we derive a fully analytic ELBO objective for the standard sparse coding generative model",

In such context, it is crucial to develop algorithms that are robust to the choice of hyperparameters and to gradients heterogeneity since, in practice, both the choice of step-size and behaviour of target gradients induce hard-to-control biases in the invariant distribution. In this work we introduce the stochastic gradient Barker dynamics (SGBD) algorithm, extending the recently developed Barker MCMC scheme, a robust alternative to Langevin-based sampling algorithms, to the stochastic gradient framework. We characterize the impact of stochastic gradients on the Barker transition mechanism and develop a bias-corrected version that, under suitable assumptions, eliminates the error due to the gradient noise in the proposal. We illustrate the performance on a number of high-dimensional examples, showing that SGBD is more robust to hyperparameter tuning and to irregular behavior of the target gradients compared to the popular stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics algorithm",

Derived from causal learning, recent works of invariant learning pursue strict invariance with multiple training environments. Although intuitively reasonable, strong assumptions on the availability and quality of environments are made to learn the strict invariance property. In this work, we come up with the \"distributional stability\" notion to mitigate such limitations. It quantifies the stability of prediction mechanisms among sub-populations down to a prescribed scale. Based on this, we propose the learnability assumption and derive the generalization error bound under distribution shifts. Inspired by theoretical analyses, we propose our novel stable risk minimization (SRM) algorithm to enhance the model's stability w.r.t. shifts in prediction mechanisms (Y|X-shifts).

We bridge these model classes by introducing probabilistic integral circuits (PICs), a new language of computational graphs that extends PCs with integral units representing continuous LVs. In the first place, PICs are symbolic computational graphs and are fully tractable in simple cases where analytical integration is possible. In practice, we parameterise PICs with light-weight neural nets delivering an intractable hierarchical continuous mixture that can be approximated arbitrarily well with large PCs using numerical quadrature.

The extensive-form perfect equilibrium (EFPE) amends such a weakness by accounting for the possibility that players may make mistakes. This is crucial in the real world, which involves humans with bounded rationality, and it is also key in boosting superhuman agents for games like Poker. Nevertheless, there are only few algorithms for computing NE refinements, which either lack convergence guarantees to exact equilibria or do not scale to large games. We provide the first efficient iterative algorithm that provably converges to an EFPE in two-player zero-sum sequential games. Our algorithm works by tracking a sequence of equilibria of regularized-perturbed games, by using a procedure that is specifically tailored to converge last iterate to such equilibria. The procedure can be implemented efficiently by visiting the game tree, making our method computationally appealing. We also empirically evaluate our algorithm, showing that its strategies are much more robust to players' mistakes than those of state-of-the-art algorithms",

Most work on learning from noisy labels has focused on standard loss-based performance measures. However, many machine learning problems require using non-decomposable performance measures which cannot be expressed as the expectation or sum of a loss on individual examples; these include for example the H-mean, Q-mean and G-mean in class imbalance settings, and the Micro F1 in information retrieval. In this paper, we design algorithms to learn from noisy labels for two broad classes of multiclass non-decomposable performance measures, namely, monotonic convex and ratio-of-linear, which encompass all the above examples. Our work builds on the Frank-Wolfe and Bisection based methods of Narasimhan et al. (2015). In both cases, we develop noise-corrected versions of the algorithms under the widely studied family of class-conditional noise models. We provide regret (excess risk) bounds for our algorithms, establishing that even though they are trained on noisy data, they are Bayes consistent in the sense that their performance converges to the optimal performance w.r.t. the clean (non-noisy) distribution.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Graph transformers have recently received significant attention in graph learning, partly due to their ability to capture more global interaction via self-attention. Nevertheless, while higher-order graph neural networks have been reasonably well studied, the exploration of extending graph transformers to higher-order variants is just starting. Both theoretical understanding and empirical results are limited. In this paper, we provide a systematic study of the theoretical expressive power of order-$k$ graph transformers and sparse variants. We first show that, an order-$k$ graph transformer without additional structural information is less expressive than the $k$-Weisfeiler Lehman ($k$-WL) test despite its high computational cost. We then explore strategies to both sparsify and enhance the higher-order graph transformers, aiming to improve both their efficiency and expressiveness. Indeed, sparsification based on neighborhood information can enhance the expressive power, as it provides additional information about input graph structures. In particular, we show that a natural neighborhood-based sparse order-$k$ transformer model is not only computationally efficient, but also expressive – as expressive as $k$-WL test. We further study several other sparse graph attention models that are computationally efficient and provide their expressiveness analysis. Finally, we provide experimental results to show the effectiveness of the different sparsification strategies",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "We propose a notion of causal influence that describes the ‘intrinsic' part of the contribution of a node on a target node in a DAG. By recursively writing each node as a function of the upstream noise terms, we separate the intrinsic information added by each node from the one obtained from its ancestors. To interpret the intrinsic information as a causal contribution, we consider ‘structure-preserving interventions' that randomize each node in a way that mimics the usual dependence on the parents and does not perturb the observed joint distribution. To get a measure that is invariant across arbitrary orderings of nodes we use Shapley based symmetrization and show that it reduces in the linear case to simple ANOVA after resolving the target node into noise variables. We describe our contribution analysis for variance and entropy, but contributions for other target metrics can be defined analogously",

Previously, the design of normalizing flows was largely constrained by the need for analytical invertibility. We overcome this constraint by a training procedure that uses an efficient estimator for the gradient of the change of variables formula. This enables any dimension-preserving neural network to serve as a generative model through maximum likelihood training. Our approach allows placing the emphasis on tailoring inductive biases precisely to the task at hand. Specifically, we achieve excellent results in molecule generation benchmarks utilizing E(n)-equivariant networks at greatly improved sampling speed.

These include reinforcement learning, imitation learning, among others. This more general paradigm is called the Concave Utility Reinforcement Learning problem (CURL). Since CURL invalidates classical Bellman equations, it requires new algorithms. We introduce MD-CURL, a new algorithm for CURL in a finite horizon Markov decision process. MD-CURL is inspired by mirror descent and uses a non-standard regularization to achieve convergence guarantees and a simple closed-form solution, eliminating the need for computationally expensive projection steps typically found in mirror descent approaches. We then extend CURL to an online learning scenario and present Greedy MD-CURL, a new method adapting MD-CURL to an online, episode-based setting with partially unknown dynamics. Like MD-CURL, the online version Greedy MD-CURL benefits from low computational complexity, while guaranteeing sub-linear or even logarithmic regret, depending on the level of information available on the underlying dynamics",

This setting is motivated by a wide range of applications where the true context for decision-making is unobserved, and only a prediction of the context by a potentially complex machine learning algorithm is available. When the context error is non-vanishing, classical bandit algorithms fail to achieve sublinear regret. We propose the first online algorithm in this setting with sublinear regret guarantees under mild conditions. The key idea is to extend the measurement error model in classical statistics to the online decision-making setting, which is nontrivial due to the policy being dependent on the noisy context observations.

We give several examples of existing methods that can be interpreted as applying this technique, and propose a new method for applying it to a wide variety of problems. Our method expands the set of distributions that can be efficiently targeted with natural gradients. Furthermore, it is fast, easy to understand, simple to implement using standard autodiff software, and does not require lengthy model-specific derivations.

Predominant graph neural networks (GNNs) rely on local message passing and struggle to learn LRI. In this paper, we propose DRGNN to learn LRI leveraging monotone operator theory. DRGNN contains two key components: (1) we use a full node similarity matrix beyond adjacency matrix – drawing inspiration from the personalized PageRank matrix – as the aggregation matrix for message passing, and (2) we implement message-passing on graphs using Douglas-Rachford splitting to circumvent prohibitive matrix inversion. We demonstrate that DRGNN surpasses various advanced GNNs, including Transformer-based models, on several benchmark LRI learning tasks arising from different application domains, highlighting its efficacy in learning LRI.

    "abstract": "A fundamental problem in robust learning is asymmetry: a learner needs to correctly classify every one of exponentially-many perturbations that an adversary might make to a test-time natural example. In contrast, the attacker only needs to find one successful perturbation. Xiang et al.[2022] proposed an algorithm that in the context of patch attacks for image classification, reduces the effective number of perturbations from an exponential to a polynomial number of perturbations and learns using an ERM oracle. However, to achieve its guarantee, their algorithm requires the natural examples to be robustly realizable. This prompts the natural question; can we extend their approach to the non-robustly-realizable case where there is no classifier with zero robust error? Our first contribution is to answer this question affirmatively by reducing this problem to a setting in which an algorithm proposed by Feige et al. [2015] can be applied, and in the process extend their guarantees. Next, we extend our results to a multi-group setting and introduce a novel agnostic multi-robust learning problem where the goal is to learn a predictor that achieves low robust loss on a (potentially) rich collection of subgroups",

We develop two asynchronous variants of the proposed algorithm that we call Model-level and Layer-level Gradient-based Weighted Averaging (resp. MGRAWA and LGRAWA), which differ in terms of the weighting scheme that is either done with respect to the entire model or is applied layer-wise. On the theoretical front, we prove the convergence guarantee for the proposed approach in both convex and non-convex settings. We then experimentally demonstrate that our algorithms outperform the competitor methods by achieving faster convergence and recovering better quality and flatter local optima. We also carry out an ablation study to analyze the scalability of the proposed algorithms in more crowded distributed training environments.

We prove that GCV is generically inconsistent as an estimator of the prediction risk of early-stopped GD, even for a well-specified linear model with isotropic features. In contrast, we show that LOOCV converges uniformly along the GD trajectory to the prediction risk. Our theory requires only mild assumptions on the data distribution and does not require the underlying regression function to be linear. Furthermore, by leveraging the individual LOOCV errors, we construct consistent estimators for the entire prediction error distribution along the GD trajectory and consistent estimators for a wide class of error functionals. This in particular enables the construction of pathwise prediction intervals based on GD iterates that have asymptotically correct nominal coverage conditional on the training data",

While the main goal of private SDG is to create a dataset that preserves the privacy of individuals contributing to the dataset, the use of synthetic data also creates an opportunity to improve fairness. Since there often exist historical biases in the datasets, using the original real data for training can lead to an unfair model. Using synthetic data, we can attempt to remove such biases from the dataset before releasing the data. In this work, we formalize the definition of fairness in synthetic data generation and provide a general framework to achieve fairness. Then we consider two notions of counterfactual fairness and information filtering fairness and show how our framework can be used for these definitions",

FLTs construct the optimal RPE mechanism implicitly by learning its spectral representation. As opposed to other architectures combining efficient low-rank linear attention with RPEs, FLTs remain practical in terms of their memory usage and do not require additional assumptions about the structure of the RPE mask. Besides, FLTs allow for applying certain structural inductive bias techniques to specify masking strategies, e.g. they provide a way to learn the so-called local RPEs introduced in this paper and give accuracy gains as compared with several other linear Transformers for language modeling. We also thoroughly test FLTs on other data modalities and tasks, such as image classification, 3D molecular modeling, and learnable optimizers. To the best of our knowledge, for 3D molecular data, FLTs are the first Transformer architectures providing linear attention and incorporating RPE masking",

It establishes identifiability and achievability results using two hard uncoupled interventions per node in the latent causal graph. Notably, one does not know which pair of intervention environments have the same node intervened (hence, uncoupled). For identifiability, the paper establishes that perfect recovery of the latent causal model and variables is guaranteed under uncoupled interventions. For achievability, an algorithm is designed that uses observational and interventional data and recovers the latent causal model and variables with provable guarantees. This algorithm leverages score variations across different environments to estimate the inverse of the transformer and, subsequently, the latent variables. The analysis, additionally, recovers the identifiability result for two hard coupled interventions, that is when metadata about the pair of environments that have the same node intervened is known.

Employing a stochastic approximation scheme with Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) can circumvent this issue, resulting in an algorithm known as MCMC-SAEM. While theoretical guarantees for MCMC-SAEM have previously been established, these results are restricted to the case where asymptotically unbiased MCMC algorithms are used. In practice, MCMC-SAEM is often run with asymptotically biased MCMC, for which the consequences are theoretically less understood. In this work, we fill this gap by analyzing the asymptotics and non-asymptotics of SAEM with biased MCMC steps, particularly the effect of bias. We also provide numerical experiments comparing the Metropolis-adjusted Langevin algorithm (MALA), which is asymptotically unbiased, and the unadjusted Langevin algorithm (ULA), which is asymptotically biased, on synthetic and real datasets. Experimental results show that ULA is more stable with respect to the choice of Langevin stepsize and can sometimes result in faster convergence",

    "abstract": "Modern data-driven and distributed learning frameworks deal with diverse massive data generated by clients spread across heterogeneous environments. Indeed, data heterogeneity is a major bottleneck in scaling up many distributed learning paradigms. In many settings however, heterogeneous data may be generated in clusters with shared structures, as is the case in several applications such as federated learning where a common latent variable governs the distribution of all the samples generated by a client. It is therefore natural to ask how the underlying clustered structures in distributed data can be exploited to improve learning schemes. In this paper, we tackle this question in the special case of estimating $d$-dimensional parameters of a two-component mixture of linear regressions problem where each of $m$ nodes generates $n$ samples with a shared latent variable. We employ the well-known Expectation-Maximization (EM) method to estimate the maximum likelihood parameters from m batches of dependent samples each containing n measurements. Discarding the clustered structure in the mixture model, EM is known to require $O(\\log(mn/d))$ iterations to reach the statistical accuracy of $O(\\sqrt{d/(mn)}$). In contrast, we show that if initialized properly, EM on the structured data requires only $O(1)$ iterations to reach the same statistical accuracy, as long as m grows up as $e^{o(n)}$. Our analysis establishes and combines novel asymptotic optimization and generalization guarantees for population and empirical EM with dependent samples, which may be of independent interest",

    "abstract": "By choosing a suitable function space as the dual to the non-negative measure cone, we study in a unified framework a class of functional saddle-point optimization problems, which we term the Mixed Functional Nash Equilibrium (MFNE), that underlies several existing machine learning algorithms, such as implicit generative models, distributionally robust optimization (DRO), and Wasserstein barycenters. We model the saddle-point optimization dynamics as an interacting Fisher-Rao-RKHS gradient flow when the function space is chosen as a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS). As a discrete time counterpart, we propose a primal-dual kernel mirror prox (KMP) algorithm, which uses a dual step in the RKHS, and a primal entropic mirror prox step. We then provide a unified convergence analysis of KMP in an infinite-dimensional setting for this class of MFNE problems, which establishes a convergence rate of $O(1/N)$ in the deterministic case and $O(1/\\sqrt{N})$ in the stochastic case, where $N$ is the iteration counter. As a case study, we apply our analysis to DRO, providing algorithmic guarantees for DRO robustness and convergence",

However, little is understood about how they reason and the limits of their computational capabilities. These models do not process data sequentially, and yet outperform sequential neural models such as RNNs. Recent work has shown that these models can compactly simulate the sequential reasoning abilities of deterministic finite automata (DFAs). This leads to the following question: can transformers simulate the reasoning of more complex finite state machines? In this work, we show that transformers can simulate weighted finite automata (WFAs), a class of models which subsumes DFAs, as well as weighted tree automata (WTA), a generalization of weighted automata to tree structured inputs. We prove these claims formally and provide upper bounds on the size of the transformer models needed as a function of the number of states of the target automata.

CoCoRL constructs a convex safe set based on demonstrations, which provably guarantees safety even for potentially sub-optimal (but safe) demonstrations. For near-optimal demonstrations, CoCoRL converges to the true safe set with no policy regret. We evaluate CoCoRL in gridworld environments and a driving simulation with multiple constraints. CoCoRL learns constraints that lead to safe driving behavior. Importantly, we can safely transfer the learned constraints to different tasks and environments.

The learner's goal is to minimize her regret, defined as the gap between her total revenue and that of an oracle strategy that always makes perfect CTR predictions. We first show that $\\sqrt{T}$-regret is obtainable via a computationally inefficient algorithm and that it is unavoidable since our algorithm is no easier than the classical multi-armed bandit problem. A by-product of our results is a $\\sqrt{T}$-regret bound for the simpler non-contextual setting, improving upon a recent work of [Feng et al., 2023] by removing the inverse CTR dependency that could be arbitrarily large. Then, borrowing ideas from recent advances on efficient contextual bandit algorithms, we develop two practically efficient contextual auction algorithms: the first one uses the exponential weight scheme with optimistic square errors and maintains the same $\\sqrt{T}$-regret bound, while the second one reduces the problem to online regression via a simple epsilon-greedy strategy, albeit with a worse regret bound.

Despite promising successes, existing methods are still challenged by data sparsity and noise issues, both of which are ubiquitous in practice. Moreover, state-of-the-art methods lack uncertainty quantification and/or are costly in training. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel equation discovery method based on Kernel learning and BAyesian Spike-and-Slab priors (KBASS). We use kernel regression to estimate the target function, which is flexible, expressive, and more robust to data sparsity and noises. We combine it with a Bayesian spike-and-slab prior — an ideal Bayesian sparse distribution — for effective operator selection and uncertainty quantification. We develop an expectation-propagation expectation-maximization (EP-EM) algorithm for efficient posterior inference and function estimation. To overcome the computational challenge of kernel regression, we place the function values on a mesh and induce a Kronecker product construction, and we use tensor algebra to enable efficient computation and optimization. We show the advantages of KBASS on a list of benchmark ODE and PDE discovery tasks. The code is available at \\url{https://github.com/long-da/KBASS}",

In this work, we develop a variational flow family for discrete distributions without any continuous embedding. First, we develop a measure-preserving and discrete (MAD) invertible map that leaves the discrete target invariant, and then create a mixed variational flow (MAD Mix) based on that map. Our family provides access to i.i.d. sampling and density evaluation with virtually no tuning effort. We also develop an extension to MAD Mix that handles joint discrete and continuous models.

It not only achieves the state-of-the-art performance in many tasks, but also is efficient in training and prediction. However, collecting training data for the FNO can be a costly bottleneck in practice, because it often demands expensive physical simulations. To overcome this problem, we propose Multi-Resolution Active Learning of FNO (MRA-FNO), which can dynamically select the input functions and resolutions to lower the data cost as much as possible while optimizing the learning efficiency. Specifically, we propose a probabilistic multi-resolution FNO and use ensemble Monte-Carlo to develop an effective posterior inference algorithm. To conduct active learning, we maximize a utility-cost ratio as the acquisition function to acquire new examples and resolutions at each step. We use moment matching and the matrix determinant lemma to enable tractable, efficient utility computation. Furthermore, we develop a cost annealing framework to avoid over-penalizing high-resolution queries at the early stage. The over-penalization is severe when the cost difference is significant between the resolutions, which renders active learning often stuck at low-resolution queries and inferior performance. Our method overcomes this problem and applies to general multi-fidelity active learning and optimization problems.

For example, given a dataset of proteins and their corresponding fluorescence levels, we might want to optimize for a new protein with the highest possible fluorescence. This kind of data-driven optimization (DDO) presents a range of challenges beyond those in standard prediction problems, since we need models that successfully predict the performance of new designs that are better than the best designs seen in the training set. It is not clear theoretically when existing approaches can even perform better than the na ïve approach that simply selects the best design in the dataset. In this paper, we study how structure can enable sample-efficient data-driven optimization. To formalize the notion of structure, we introduce functional graphical models (FGMs) and show theoretically how they can provide for principled data-driven optimization by decomposing the original high-dimensional optimization problem into smaller sub-problems. This allows us to derive much more practical regret bounds for DDO, and the result implies that DDO with FGMs can achieve nearly optimal designs in situations where naïve approaches fail due to insufficient coverage of the offline data.

The use and collection of users' data in experiments often involve sensitive personal information, so additional measures to protect individual privacy are required during data collection, storage, and usage. In this work, we focus on the rigorous protection of users' privacy (under the notion of differential privacy (DP)) while minimizing the trust toward service providers. Specifically, we consider the estimation of the average treatment effect (ATE) under DP, while only allowing the analyst to collect population-level statistics via secure aggregation, a distributed protocol enabling a service provider to aggregate information without accessing individual data. Although a vital component in modern A/B testing workflows, private distributed experimentation has not previously been studied. To achieve DP, we design local privatization mechanisms that are compatible with secure aggregation and analyze the utility, in terms of the width of confidence intervals, both asymptotically and non-asymptotically. We show how these mechanisms can be scaled up to handle the very large number of participants commonly found in practice. In addition, when introducing DP noise, it is imperative to cleverly split privacy budgets to estimate both the mean and variance of the outcomes and carefully calibrate the confidence intervals according to the DP noise.

Instead, the defender relies exclusively on a set of pre-existing detectors readily available \"off the shelf.\" To tackle this challenge, we derive an innovative information-theoretic defense approach that optimally aggregates the decisions made by these detectors, eliminating the need for any training data.

Nevertheless, we identify benign conditions where costless model selection is feasible: gradually increasing class complexity, and diminishing marginal returns for best-in-class policy value with increasing class complexity. Our algorithm is based on a novel misspecification test, and our analysis demonstrates the benefits of using model selection for reward estimation. Unlike prior work on model selection in contextual bandits, our algorithm carefully adapts to the evolving bias-variance trade-off as more data is collected. In particular, our algorithm and analysis go beyond adapting to the complexity of the simplest realizable class and instead adapt to the complexity of the simplest class whose estimation variance dominates the bias.

We, therefore, augment CPO to additionally provide semantically meaningful visual summaries of the uncertainty regions to give qualitative intuition for the optimal decision.

    "abstract": "A lexicographic maximum of a set $X \\subseteq R^n$ is a vector in $X$ whose smallest component is as large as possible, and subject to that requirement, whose second smallest component is as large as possible, and so on for the third smallest component, etc. Lexicographic maximization has numerous practical and theoretical applications, including fair resource allocation, analyzing the implicit regularization of learning algorithms, and characterizing refinements of game-theoretic equilibria. We prove that a minimizer in $X$ of the exponential loss function $L_c(x) = \\sum_i \\exp(-c x_i)$ converges to a lexicographic maximum of $X$ as $c \\to \\infty$, provided that $X$ is \\emph{stable} in the sense that a well-known iterative method for finding a lexicographic maximum of $X$ cannot be made to fail simply by reducing the required quality of each iterate by an arbitrarily tiny degree. Our result holds for both near and exact minimizers of the exponential loss, while earlier convergence results made much stronger assumptions about the set $X$ and only held for the exact minimizer. We are aware of no previous results showing a connection between the iterative method for computing a lexicographic maximum and exponential loss minimization. We show that every convex polytope is stable, but that there exist compact, convex sets that are not stable. We also provide the first analysis of the convergence rate of an exponential loss minimizer (near or exact) and discover a curious dichotomy: While the two smallest components of the vector converge to the lexicographically maximum values very quickly (at roughly the rate $\\frac{\\log n}{c}$), all other components can converge arbitrarily slowly",

    "title": "Can Probabilistic Feedback Drive User Impacts in Online Platforms?",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "A common explanation for negative user impacts of content recommender systems is misalignment between the platform's objective and user welfare. In this work, we show that misalignment in the platform's objective is not the only potential cause of unintended impacts on users: even when the platform's objective is fully aligned with user welfare, the platform's learning algorithm can induce negative downstream impacts on users. The source of these user impacts is that different pieces of content may generate observable user reactions (feedback information) at different rates; these feedback rates may correlate with content properties, such as controversiality or demographic similarity of the creator, that affect the user experience. Since differences in feedback rates can impact how often the learning algorithm engages with different content, the learning algorithm may inadvertently promote content with certain such properties. Using the multi-armed bandit framework with probabilistic feedback, we examine the relationship between feedback rates and a learning algorithm's engagement with individual arms for different no-regret algorithms. We prove that no-regret algorithms can exhibit a wide range of dependencies: if the feedback rate of an arm increases, some no-regret algorithms engage with the arm more, some no-regret algorithms engage with the arm less, and other no-regret algorithms engage with the arm approximately the same number of times. From a platform design perspective, our results highlight the importance of looking beyond regret when measuring an algorithm's performance, and assessing the nature of a learning algorithm's engagement with different types of content as well as their resulting downstream impacts",

    "abstract": "Graph Laplacian learning, also known as network topology inference, is a problem of great interest to multiple communities. In Gaussian graphical models (GM), graph learning amounts to endowing covariance selection with the Laplacian structure. In graph signal processing (GSP), it is essential to infer the unobserved graph from the outputs of a filtering system. In this paper, we study the problem of learning Cartesian product graphs under Laplacian constraints. The Cartesian graph product is a natural way for modeling higher-order conditional dependencies and is also the key for generalizing GSP to multi-way tensors. We establish statistical consistency for the penalized maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) of a Cartesian product Laplacian, and propose an efficient algorithm to solve the problem. We also extend our method for efficient joint graph learning and imputation in the presence of structural missing values.

    "abstract": "Motivated by the computation of the non-parametric maximum likelihood estimator (NPMLE) and the Bayesian posterior in statistics, this paper explores the problem of convex optimization over the space of all probability distributions. We introduce an implicit scheme, called the implicit KL proximal descent (IKLPD) algorithm, for discretizing a continuous-time gradient flow relative to the Kullback–Leibler (KL) divergence for minimizing a convex target functional. We show that IKLPD converges to a global optimum at a polynomial rate from any initialization; moreover, if the objective functional is strongly convex relative to the KL divergence, for example, when the target functional itself is a KL divergence as in the context of Bayesian posterior computation, IKLPD exhibits globally exponential convergence. Computationally, we propose a numerical method based on normalizing flow to realize IKLPD. Conversely, our numerical method can also be viewed as a new approach that sequentially trains a normalizing flow for minimizing a convex functional with a strong theoretical guarantee",

Given that querying full consensus can be costly, we propose a general framework for online Bayesian consensus estimation, leveraging properties of the multivariate hypergeometric distribution. Based on this framework, we propose a family of methods that dynamically estimate expert consensus from partial feedback by producing a posterior over expert and model beliefs. Analyzing this posterior induces an interpretable trade-off between querying cost and classification performance.

In earlier work, a method was developed using Bayesian Networks to approximate the population dynamics in these games. One of the advantages of the Bayesian Network modeling approach is that it is possible to smoothly adjust the size of the network to get more accurate approximations. However, scaling the method up can be intractable if the number of strategies in the evolutionary game increases. In this paper, we propose a new method for computing more accurate approximations by using surrogate Bayesian Networks. Instead of computing inference on larger networks directly, we perform inference on a much smaller surrogate network extended with parameters that exploit the symmetry inherent to the domain. We learn the parameters on the surrogate network using KL-divergence as the loss function. We illustrate the value of this method empirically through a comparison on several evolutionary games",

This limitation arises from the erroneous empirical estimation of $\\mathcal{H}$-divergence with few source domain samples. To tackle this problem, we propose a double-head discriminator algorithm by introducing an addition source-only domain discriminator trained solely on the source learning phase. We prove that by introducing a pre-trained source-only domain discriminator, the empirical estimation error of $\\mathcal{H}$-divergence related adversarial loss is reduced from the source domain side. Further experiments on existing domain adaptation benchmarks show that our proposed algorithm achieves more than 2$%$ improvement on all categories of target domain adaptation tasks while significantly mitigating the forgetting of the source domain",

Moreover, these classifiers are not responsive to importance weights in the asymptotic training regime. In this work we propose Bi-level GDRO, a provably convergent formulation that decouples the adversary's and model learner's objective and improves generalization guarantees. To address non-responsiveness of importance weights, we combine Bi-level GDRO with a learner that optimizes a temperature-scaled loss that can provably trade off performance between demographics, even on interpolating classifiers.

On the flipside, users may strategically choose which services to use in order to pursue their own reward functions, in the process wielding power over which services can see and use their data. Extensive prior research has been conducted on the effects of strategic users in single-service settings, with strategic behavior manifesting in the manipulation of observable features to achieve a desired classification; however, this can often be costly or unattainable for users and fails to capture the full behavior of multi-service dynamic systems. As such, we analyze a setting in which strategic users choose among several available services in order to pursue positive classifications, while services seek to minimize loss functions on their observations. We focus our analysis on realizable settings, and show that naive retraining can still lead to oscillation even if all users are observed at different times; however, if this retraining uses memory of past observations, convergent behavior can be guaranteed for certain loss function classes.

This problem arises from the goodness-of-fit test when we would like to test whether the data are generated from $g_{0}(Y|X)$ (null hypothesis) or they are generated from the whole mixture (alternative hypothesis). Based on the algebraic structure of the expert functions and the distinguishability between $g_0$ and the mixture part, we construct novel Voronoi-based loss functions to capture the convergence rates of maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) for our models. We further demonstrate that our proposed loss functions characterize the local convergence rates of parameter estimation more accurately than the generalized Wasserstein, a loss function being commonly used for estimating parameters in the Gaussian mixture of experts",

    "title": "Towards Convergence Rates for Parameter Estimation in Gaussian-gated Mixture of Experts",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Originally introduced as a neural network for ensemble learning, mixture of experts (MoE) has recently become a fundamental building block of highly successful modern deep neural networks for heterogeneous data analysis in several applications of machine learning and statistics. Despite its popularity in practice, a satisfactory level of theoretical understanding of the MoE model is far from complete. To shed new light on this problem, we provide a convergence analysis for maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) in the Gaussian-gated MoE model. The main challenge of that analysis comes from the inclusion of covariates in the Gaussian gating functions and expert networks, which leads to their intrinsic interaction via some partial differential equations with respect to their parameters. We tackle these issues by designing novel Voronoi loss functions among parameters to accurately capture the heterogeneity of parameter estimation rates. Our findings reveal that the MLE has distinct behaviors under two complement settings of location parameters of the Gaussian gating functions, namely when all these parameters are non-zero versus when at least one among them vanishes. Notably, these behaviors can be characterized by the solvability of two different systems of polynomial equations. Finally, we conduct a simulation study to empirically verify our theoretical results",

    "abstract": "We consider the problem of finding second-order stationary points in the optimization of heterogeneous federated learning (FL). Previous works in FL mostly focus on first-order convergence guarantees, which do not rule out the scenario of unstable saddle points. Meanwhile, it is a key bottleneck of FL to achieve communication efficiency without compensating the learning accuracy, especially when local data are highly heterogeneous across different clients. Given this, we propose a novel algorithm PowerEF-SGD that only communicates compressed information via a novel error-feedback scheme. To our knowledge, PowerEF-SGD is the first distributed and compressed SGD algorithm that provably escapes saddle points in heterogeneous FL without any data homogeneity assumptions. In particular, PowerEF-SGD improves to second-order stationary points after visiting first-order (possibly saddle) points, using additional gradient queries and communication rounds only of almost the same order required by first-order convergence, and the convergence rate shows a linear-speedup pattern in terms of the number of workers. Our theory improves/recovers previous results, while extending to much more tolerant settings on the local data. Numerical experiments are provided to complement the theory",

Under the view of coupled oscillators, we first show the connection between Kuramoto model and basic GNN and then over-smoothing phenomenon in GNNs can be interpreted as phase synchronization in Kuramoto model. The KuramotoGNN replaces this phase synchronization with frequency synchronization to prevent the node features from converging into each other while allowing the system to still reach a stable synchronized state.

    "abstract": "We study off-dynamics Reinforcement Learning (RL), where the policy is trained on a source domain and deployed to a distinct target domain. We aim to solve this problem via online distributionally robust Markov decision processes (DRMDPs), where the learning algorithm actively interacts with the source domain while seeking the optimal performance under the worst possible dynamics that is within an uncertainty set of the source domain's transition kernel. We provide the first study on online DRMDPs with function approximation for off-dynamics RL. We find that DRMDPs' dual formulation can induce nonlinearity, even when the nominal transition kernel is linear, leading to error propagation. By designing a $d$-rectangular uncertainty set using the total variation distance, we remove this additional nonlinearity and bypass the error propagation. We then introduce DR-LSVI-UCB, the first provably efficient online DRMDP algorithm for off-dynamics RL with function approximation, and establish a polynomial suboptimality bound that is independent of the state and action space sizes. Our work makes the first step towards a deeper understanding of the provable efficiency of online DRMDPs with linear function approximation.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Federated learning enables training high-utility models across several clients without directly sharing their private data. As a downside, the federated setting makes the model vulnerable to various adversarial attacks in the presence of malicious clients. Despite the theoretical and empirical success in defending against attacks that aim to degrade models' utility, defense against backdoor attacks that increase model accuracy on backdoor samples exclusively without hurting the utility on other samples remains challenging. To this end, we first analyze the failure modes of existing defenses over a flat loss landscape, which is common for well-designed neural networks such as Resnet (He et al., 2015) but is often overlooked by previous works. Then, we propose an invariant aggregator that redirects the aggregated update to invariant directions that are generally useful via selectively masking out the update elements that favor few and possibly malicious clients. Theoretical results suggest that our approach provably mitigates backdoor attacks and remains effective over flat loss landscapes. Empirical results on three datasets with different modalities and varying numbers of clients further demonstrate that our approach mitigates a broad class of backdoor attacks with a negligible cost on the model utility",

    "title": "Policy Evaluation for Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback: A Sample Complexity Analysis",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "A recently popular approach to solving reinforcement learning is with data from human preferences. In fact, human preference data are now used with classic reinforcement learning algorithms such as actor-critic methods, which involve evaluating an intermediate policy over a reward learned from human preference data with distribution shift, known as off-policy evaluation (OPE). Such algorithm includes (i) learning reward function from human preference dataset, and (ii) learning expected cumulative reward of a target policy. Despite the huge empirical success, existing OPE methods with preference data often lack theoretical understandings and rely heavily on heuristics. In this paper, we study the sample efficiency of OPE with human preference and establish a statistical guarantee for it. Specifically, we approach OPE with learning the value function by fitted-Q-evaluation with a deep neural network. By appropriately selecting the size of a ReLU network, we show that one can leverage any low-dimensional manifold structure in the Markov decision process and obtain a sample-efficient estimator without suffering from the curse of high data ambient dimensionality. Under the assumption of high reward smoothness, our results almost align with the classical OPE results with observable reward data. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first result that establishes a provably efficient guarantee for off-policy evaluation with RLHF",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Motivated by applications in large-scale and multi-agent reinforcement learning, we study the non-asymptotic performance of stochastic approximation (SA) schemes with delayed updates under Markovian sampling. While the effect of delays has been extensively studied for optimization, the manner in which they interact with the underlying Markov process to shape the finite-time performance of SA remains poorly understood. In this context, our first main contribution is to show that under time-varying bounded delays, the delayed SA update rule guarantees exponentially fast convergence of the \\emph{last iterate} to a ball around the SA operator's fixed point. Notably, our bound is \\emph{tight} in its dependence on both the maximum delay $\\tau_{max}$, and the mixing time $\\tau_{mix}$. To achieve this tight bound, we develop a novel inductive proof technique that, unlike various existing delayed-optimization analyses, relies on establishing uniform boundedness of the iterates. As such, our proof may be of independent interest. Next, to mitigate the impact of the maximum delay on the convergence rate, we provide the first finite-time analysis of a delay-adaptive SA scheme under Markovian sampling. In particular, we show that the exponent of convergence of this scheme gets scaled down by $\\tau_{avg}$, as opposed to $\\tau_{max}$ for the vanilla delayed SA rule; here, $\\tau_{avg}$ denotes the average delay across all iterations. Moreover, the adaptive scheme requires no prior knowledge of the delay sequence for step-size tuning. Our theoretical findings shed light on the finite-time effects of delays for a broad class of algorithms, including TD learning, Q-learning, and stochastic gradient descent under Markovian sampling",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Multi-agent reinforcement learning has a wide range of applications in cooperative settings, but ensuring data privacy among agents is a significant challenge. To address this challenge, we propose Privacy-Preserving Decentralized Actor-Critic (PPDAC), an algorithm that motivates agents to cooperate while maintaining their data privacy. Leveraging trajectory ranking, PPDAC enables the agents to learn a cooperation reward that encourages agents to account for other agents' preferences. Subsequently, each agent trains a policy that maximizes not only its local reward as in independent actor-critic (IAC) but also the cooperation reward, hence, increasing cooperation. Importantly, communication among agents is restricted to their ranking of trajectories that only include public identifiers without any private local data. Moreover, as an additional layer of privacy, the agents can perturb their rankings with the randomized response method. We evaluate PPDAC on the level-based foraging (LBF) environment and a coin-gathering environment. We compare with IAC and Shared Experience Actor-Critic (SEAC) which achieves SOTA results for the LBF environment. The results show that PPDAC consistently outperforms IAC. In addition, PPDAC outperforms SEAC in the coin-gathering environment and achieves similar performance in the LBF environment, all while providing better privacy",

    "title": "On the Model-Misspecification in Reinforcement Learning",

    "abstract": "The success of reinforcement learning (RL) crucially depends on effective function approximation when dealing with complex ground-truth models. Existing sample-efficient RL algorithms primarily employ three approaches to function approximation: policy-based, value-based, and model-based methods. However, in the face of model misspecification—a disparity between the ground-truth and optimal function approximators—it is shown that policy-based approaches can be robust even when the policy function approximation is under a large \\emph{locally-bounded} misspecification error, with which the function class may exhibit a $\\Omega(1)$ approximation error in specific states and actions, but remains small on average within a policy-induced state distribution. Yet it remains an open question whether similar robustness can be achieved with value-based and model-based approaches, especially with general function approximation. To bridge this gap, in this paper we present a unified theoretical framework for addressing model misspecification in RL. We demonstrate that, through meticulous algorithm design and sophisticated analysis, value-based and model-based methods employing general function approximation can achieve robustness under local misspecification error bounds. In particular, they can attain a regret bound of $\\widetilde{O}\\left(\\mathrm{poly}(dH)\\cdot(\\sqrt{K} + K\\cdot\\zeta) \\right)$, where $d$ represents the complexity of the function class, $H$ is the episode length, $K$ is the total number of episodes, and $\\zeta$ denotes the local bound for misspecification error.

In a setting with $K$ total arms and at most $A$ available arms in each round over $T$ rounds, the best known upper bound is $O(K\\sqrt{TA\\ln{K}})$, obtained indirectly via minimizing internal sleeping regrets. Compared to the minimax $\\Omega(\\sqrt{TA})$ lower bound, this upper bound contains an extra multiplicative factor of $K\\ln{K}$. We address this gap by directly minimizing the per-action regret using generalized versions of EXP3, EXP3-IX and FTRL with Tsallis entropy, thereby obtaining near-optimal bounds of order $O(\\sqrt{TA\\ln{K}})$ and $O(\\sqrt{T\\sqrt{AK}})$. We extend our results to the setting of bandits with advice from sleeping experts, generalizing EXP4 along the way. This leads to new proofs for a number of existing adaptive and tracking regret bounds for standard non-sleeping bandits. Extending our results to the bandit version of experts that report their confidences leads to new bounds for the confidence regret that depends primarily on the sum of experts' confidences. We prove a lower bound, showing that for any minimax optimal algorithms, there exists an action whose regret is sublinear in $T$ but linear in the number of its active rounds",

    "abstract": "Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are gold standards for assessing intervention efficacy. Yet, generalizing evidence from classical RCTs can be challenging and sometimes problematic due to their limited external validity under stringent eligibility criteria and inadequate statistical power resulting from limited sample sizes under budgetary constraints. \"Digital clinical trial,\" which utilizes digital technology and electronic medical records (EMRs) to expand eligibility criteria and enhance data collection efficiency, offers a promising concept for solving the above-mentioned conundrums encountered in classical RCTs. In this paper, we propose two novel digital clinical trial design strategies assisted by EMRs collected from diverse patient populations. On the one hand, leveraging digital technologies, our design strategies adaptively modify both the eligibility criteria and treatment assignment mechanism to enhance data collection efficiency. As a result, evidence gathered from our design can possess greater statistical power. On the other hand, since EMRs capture diverse patient populations and provide large sample sizes, our design not only broadens the trial's eligibility criteria but also enhances its statistical power, enabling us to collect more generalizable evidence with boosted statistical power for evaluating intervention efficacy than classical RCTs. We demonstrate the validity and merit of the proposed designs with detailed theoretical investigation, simulation studies, and a synthetic case study",

    "title": "Multivariate Time Series Forecasting By Graph Attention Networks With Theoretical Guarantees",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Multivariate time series forecasting (MTSF) aims to predict future values of multiple variables based on past values of multivariate time series, and has been applied in fields including traffic flow prediction, stock price forecasting, and anomaly detection. Capturing the inter-dependencies among multiple series poses one significant challenge to MTSF. Recent works have considered modeling the correlated series as graph nodes and using graph neural network (GNN)-based approaches with attention mechanisms added to improve the test prediction accuracy, however, none of them have theoretical guarantees regarding the generalization error. In this paper, we develop a new norm-bounded graph attention network (GAT) for MTSF by upper-bounding the Frobenius norm of weights in each layer of the GAT model to enhance performance. We theoretically establish that the generalization error bound for our model is associated with various components of GAT models: the number of attention heads, the maximum number of neighbors, the upper bound of the Frobenius norm of the weight matrix in each layer, and the norm of the input features. Empirically, we investigate the impact of different components of GAT models on the generalization performance of MTSF on real data. Our experiment verifies our theoretical findings. We compare with multiple prior frequently cited graph-based methods for MTSF using real data sets and the experiment results show our method can achieve the best performance for MTSF. Our method provides novel perspectives for improving the generalization performance of MTSF, and our theoretical guarantees give substantial implications for designing graph-based methods with attention mechanisms for MTSF",

Popular tree ensemble toolkits e.g., Gradient Boosted Trees and Random Forests support feature selection post-training based on feature importance scores, while very popular, they are known to have drawbacks. We propose Skinny Trees: an end-to-end toolkit for feature selection in tree ensembles where we train a tree ensemble while controlling the number of selected features. Our optimization-based approach learns an ensemble of differentiable trees, and simultaneously performs feature selection using a grouped $\\ell_0$-regularizer. We use first-order methods for optimization and present convergence guarantees for our approach. We use a dense-to-sparse regularization scheduling scheme that can lead to more expressive and sparser tree ensembles. On 15 synthetic and real-world datasets, Skinny Trees can achieve $1.5{\\times}$–$620{\\times}$ feature compression rates, leading up to $10{\\times}$ faster inference over dense trees, without any loss in performance. Skinny Trees lead to superior feature selection than many existing toolkits e.g., in terms of AUC performance for 25% feature budget, Skinny Trees outperforms LightGBM by 10.2% (up to 37.7%), and Random Forests by 3% (up to 12.5%)",

We tackle this contextual DAG problem via a neural network that maps the contextual features to a DAG, represented as a weighted adjacency matrix. The neural network is equipped with a novel projection layer that ensures the output matrices are sparse and satisfy a recently developed characterization of acyclicity. We devise a scalable computational framework for learning contextual DAGs and provide a convergence guarantee and an analytical gradient for backpropagating through the projection layer.

However, in safety-critical scenarios like medical diagnosis and network attack detection, discrepancies between the training and test sets, including the potential presence of novel outlier samples not appearing during training, can pose significant challenges. To address this problem, we introduce the Conformalized Semi-Supervised Random Forest (CSForest), which couples the conformalization technique Jackknife+aB with semi-supervised tree ensembles to construct a set-valued prediction $C(x)$. Instead of optimizing over the training distribution, CSForest employs unlabeled test samples to enhance accuracy and flag unseen outliers by generating an empty set. Theoretically, we establish CSForest to cover true labels for previously observed inlier classes under arbitrarily label-shift in the test data. We compare CSForest with state-of-the-art methods using synthetic examples and various real-world datasets, under different types of distribution changes in the test domain. Our results highlight CSForest's effective prediction of inliers and its ability to detect outlier samples unique to the test data. In addition, CSForest shows persistently good performance as the sizes of the training and test sets vary. Codes of CSForest are available at https://github.com/yujinhan98/CSForest",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Symbolic Regression (SR) is an approach which learns a closed-form function relating the predictors to the outcome in a dataset. Datasets are often multi-level (MuL), meaning that certain features can be used to split data into groups for analysis (we refer to these features as levels). The advantage of viewing datasets as MuL is that we can exploit the high similarity of data within a group. SR is well-suited for MuL datasets, in which the learnt function structure serves as ‘shared information' between the groups while the learnt parameter values capture the unique relationships within each group. In this context, this paper makes three contributions: (i) We design an algorithm, Multi-level Symbolic Regression (MSR), which runs multiple parallel SR processes for each group and merges them to produce a single function structure. (ii) To tackle datasets that are not explicitly MuL, we develop a metric termed MLICC to select the best feature to serve as a level. (iii) We also release MSRBench, a database of MuL datasets (synthetic and real-world) which we developed and collated, that can be used to evaluate MSR. Our results and ablation studies demonstrate that MSR achieves a higher recovery rate and lower error on MSRBench compared to SOTA methods for SR and MuL datasets",

Moreover, we give a lower bound of model parameters as a sufficient condition for the exact recovery of GPM. The new bound breaches the information-theoretic limit for pure community detection under SBM, thus demonstrating the superiority of our simultaneous optimization algorithm over any two-stage method that performs the two tasks in succession.

This problem includes tasks such as solving the Poisson inverse problem, computing the maximum-likelihood estimate for quantum state tomography, and approximating positive semi-definite matrix permanents with the currently tightest approximation ratio. Although the optimization problem is convex, standard iteration complexity guarantees for first-order methods do not directly apply due to the absence of Lipschitz continuity and smoothness in the loss function. In this work, we propose a stochastic first-order algorithm named $B$-sample stochastic dual averaging with the logarithmic barrier. For the Poisson inverse problem, our algorithm attains an $\\varepsilon$-optimal solution in $\\smash{\\tilde{O}}(d^2/\\varepsilon^2)$ time, matching the state of the art, where $d$ denotes the dimension. When computing the maximum-likelihood estimate for quantum state tomography, our algorithm yields an $\\varepsilon$-optimal solution in $\\smash{\\tilde{O}}(d^3/\\varepsilon^2)$ time. This improves on the time complexities of existing stochastic first-order methods by a factor of $d^{\\omega-2}$ and those of batch methods by a factor of $d^2$, where $\\omega$ denotes the matrix multiplication exponent.

To this end, we devise a new Monte Carlo Tree Search algorithm, Thompson Sampling Decision Trees (TSDT), able to produce optimal Decision Trees in an online setting.

Our work is the first work that focuses on such an optimal data collection strategy for policy evaluation involving heteroscedastic reward noise in the linear bandit setting. We first formulate an optimal design for weighted least squares estimates in the heteroscedastic linear bandit setting with the knowledge of noise variances. This design minimizes the mean squared error (MSE) of the estimated value of the target policy and is termed the oracle design. Since the noise variance is typically unknown, we then introduce a novel algorithm, SPEED (\\textbf{S}tructured \\textbf{P}olicy \\textbf{E}valuation \\textbf{E}xperimental \\textbf{D}esign), that tracks the oracle design and derive its regret with respect to the oracle design.

In stochastic processes, graphs may represent so-called local independence or conditional Granger causality. Under some regularity conditions, a local independence graph implies a set of independences using a graphical criterion known as delta-separation, or using its generalization, mu-separation. This is a stochastic process analogue of d-separation in DAGs. However, there may be more independences than implied by this graph and this is a violation of so-called faithfulness. We characterize faithfulness in local independence graphs and give a method to construct a faithful graph from any local independence model such that the output equals the true graph when Markov and faithfulness assumptions hold. We discuss various assumptions that are weaker than faithfulness, and we explore different structure learning algorithms and their properties under varying assumptions",

    "abstract": "Morden deep ensembles technique achieves strong uncertainty estimation performance by going through multiple forward passes with different models. This is at the price of a high storage space and a slow speed in the inference (test) time. To address this issue, we propose Density-Regression, a method that leverages the density function in uncertainty estimation and achieves fast inference by a single forward pass. We prove it is distance aware on the feature space, which is a necessary condition for a neural network to produce high-quality uncertainty estimation under distribution shifts. Empirically, we conduct experiments on regression tasks with the cubic toy dataset, benchmark UCI, weather forecast with time series, and depth estimation under real-world shifted applications. We show that Density-Regression has competitive uncertainty estimation performance under distribution shifts with modern deep regressors while using a lower model size and a faster inference speed",

Unlike classical maximum likelihood (ML) estimation that relies on importance sampling (resulting in ML-IS) or MCMC (resulting in contrastive divergence, CD), NCE uses a proxy criterion to avoid the need for evaluating an often intractable normalisation constant. Despite apparent conceptual differences, we show that two NCE criteria, ranking NCE (RNCE) and conditional NCE (CNCE), can be viewed as ML estimation methods. Specifically, RNCE is equivalent to ML estimation combined with conditional importance sampling, and both RNCE and CNCE are special cases of CD. These findings bridge the gap between the two method classes and allow us to apply techniques from the ML-IS and CD literature to NCE, offering several advantageous extensions",

Although the minimally sufficient adjustment set for estimation of full-state transition properties depends on the whole state, the optimal policy and therefore state-action value function depends only on the sparse component: we call this causal/decision-theoretic sparsity. We develop a method for reward-filtering the estimation of the state-action value function to the sparse component by a modification of thresholded lasso in least-squares policy evaluation.

However, even though they achieve state-of-the-art results on in-domain test sets, they tend to be overconfident on out-of-distribution (OOD) data. For instance, ReLU networks—a popular class of neural network architectures—have been shown to almost always yield high confidence predictions when the test data are far away from the training set, even when they are trained with OOD data. We overcome this problem by adding a term to the output of the neural network that corresponds to the logit of an extra class, that we design to dominate the logits of the original classes as we move away from the training data. This technique provably prevents arbitrarily high confidence on far-away test data while maintaining a simple discriminative point-estimate training. Evaluation on various benchmarks demonstrates strong performance against competitive baselines on both far-away and realistic OOD data",

    "abstract": "There has been increasing interest in applying multi-armed bandits to adaptive designs in clinical trials. However, most literature assumes that a previous patient's survival response of a treatment is known before the next patient is treated, which is unrealistic. The inability to account for response delays is cited frequently as one of the problems in using adaptive designs in clinical trials. More critically, the \"delays\" in observing the survival response are the same as the rewards rather than being external stochastic noise. We formalize this problem as a novel stochastic multi-armed bandit (MAB) problem with reward-dependent delays, where the delay at each round depends on the reward generated on the same round. For general reward/delay distributions with finite expectation, our proposed censored-UCB algorithm achieves near-optimal regret in terms of both problem-dependent and problem-independent bounds. With bounded or sub-Gaussian reward distributions, the upper bounds are optimal with a matching lower bound. Our theoretical results and the algorithms' effectiveness are validated by empirical experiments",

Samples from these processes exhibit a form of self-avoidance, so they are also helpful in guiding algorithms that explore to reduce uncertainty, such as in active learning, Bayesian optimization, reinforcement learning, and marginalization in graphical models. The best-known algorithms for sampling from DPPs exactly require significant computational expense, which can be unwelcome in machine learning applications when the cost of sampling is relatively low and capturing the precise repulsive nature of the DPP may not be critical. We suggest an inexpensive approximate strategy for sampling a fixed number of points (as would typically be desired in a machine learning setting) from a so-called $k$-DPP based on iterative inverse transform sampling. We prove that our algorithm satisfies a $(1 - 1/\\epsilon)$ approximation guarantee relative to exact sampling from the $k$-DPP, and provide an efficient implementation for many common kernels used in machine learning, including the Gaussian and Matérn class.

In particular, given that the query respects some L2 sensitivity property (the L2 distance between outputs on any two neighboring inputs is bounded), GM guarantees Rényi Differential Privacy (RDP). Unfortunately, precisely bounding the L2 sensitivity can be hard, thus leading to loose privacy bounds. In this work, we consider a Relative L2 sensitivity assumption, in which the bound on the distance between two query outputs may also depend on their norm. Leveraging this assumption, we introduce the Relative Gaussian Mechanism (RGM), in which the variance of the noise depends on the norm of the output. We prove tight bounds on the RDP parameters under relative L2 sensitivity, and characterize the privacy loss incurred by using output-dependent noise. In particular, we show that RGM naturally adapts to a latent variable that would control the norm of the output. Finally, we instantiate our framework to show tight guarantees for Private Gradient Descent, a problem that naturally fits our relative L2 sensitivity assumption",

It is known that such OT problem (i.e., tree-Wasserstein (TW)) admits a closed-form expression, but depends fundamentally on the underlying tree structure over supports of input measures. In practice, the given tree structure may be, however, perturbed due to noisy or adversarial measurements. To mitigate this issue, we follow the max-min robust OT approach which considers the maximal possible distances between two input measures over an uncertainty set of tree metrics. In general, this approach is hard to compute, even for measures supported in one-dimensional space, due to its non-convexity and non-smoothness which hinders its practical applications, especially for large-scale settings. In this work, we propose novel uncertainty sets of tree metrics from the lens of edge deletion/addition which covers a diversity of tree structures in an elegant framework. Consequently, by building upon the proposed uncertainty sets, and leveraging the tree structure over supports, we show that the robust OT also admits a closed-form expression for a fast computation as its counterpart standard OT (i.e., TW). Furthermore, we demonstrate that the robust OT satisfies the metric property and is negative definite. We then exploit its negative definiteness to propose positive definite kernels and test them in several simulations on various real-world datasets on document classification and topological data analysis",

Under kernel-based regularity assumptions on the unknown functions, we develop a no-regret, no-violation approach that exploits similarities among different reward and constraint outcomes. The no-violation property ensures that the time-averaged sum of constraint violations converges to zero as the game is repeated. We show that our algorithm referred to as c.z.AdaNormalGP, obtains kernel-dependent regret bounds, and the cumulative constraint violations have sublinear kernel-dependent upper bounds. In addition, we introduce the notion of constrained contextual coarse correlated equilibria (c.z.CCE) and show that $\\epsilon$-c.z.CCEs can be approached whenever players follow a no-regret no-violation strategy.

    "title": "Offline Primal-Dual Reinforcement Learning for Linear MDPs",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Offline Reinforcement Learning (RL) aims to learn a near-optimal policy from a fixed dataset of transitions collected by another policy. This problem has attracted a lot of attention recently, but most existing methods with strong theoretical guarantees are restricted to finite-horizon or tabular settings. In contrast, few algorithms for infinite-horizon settings with function approximation and minimal assumptions on the dataset are both sample and computationally efficient. Another gap in the current literature is the lack of theoretical analysis for the average-reward setting, which is more challenging than the discounted setting. In this paper, we address both of these issues by proposing a primal-dual optimization method based on the linear programming formulation of RL. Our key contribution is a new reparametrization that allows us to derive low-variance gradient estimators that can be used in a stochastic optimization scheme using only samples from the behavior policy. Our method finds an $\\varepsilon$-optimal policy with $O(\\varepsilon^{-4})$ samples, while being computationally efficient for infinite-horizon discounted and average-reward MDPs with realizable linear function approximation and partial coverage. Moreover, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first theoretical result for average-reward offline RL",

    "abstract": "Normalizing Flows (NF) are Generative models which transform a simple prior distribution into the desired target. They however require the design of an invertible mapping whose Jacobian determinant has to be computable. Recently introduced, Neural Hamiltonian Flows (NHF) are Hamiltonian dynamics-based flows, which are continuous, volume-preserving and invertible and thus make for natural candidates for robust NF architectures. In particular, their similarity to classical Mechanics could lead to easier interpretability of the learned mapping. In this paper, we show that the current NHF architecture may still pose a challenge to interpretability. Inspired by Physics, we introduce a fixed-kinetic energy version of the model. This approach improves interpretability and robustness while requiring fewer parameters than the original model. We illustrate that on a 2D Gaussian mixture and on the MNIST and Fashion-MNIST datasets. Finally, we show how to adapt NHF to the context of Bayesian inference and illustrate the method on an example from cosmology",

    "abstract": "We study the problem of identifying the unknown intervention targets in structural causal models where we have access to heterogeneous data collected from multiple environments. The unknown intervention targets are the set of endogenous variables whose corresponding exogenous noises change across the environments. We propose a two-phase approach which in the first phase recovers the exogenous noises corresponding to unknown intervention targets whose distributions have changed across environments. In the second phase, the recovered noises are matched with the corresponding endogenous variables. For the recovery phase, we provide sufficient conditions for learning these exogenous noises up to some component-wise invertible transformation. For the matching phase, under the causal sufficiency assumption, we show that the proposed method uniquely identifies the intervention targets. In the presence of latent confounders, the intervention targets among the observed variables cannot be determined uniquely. We provide a candidate intervention target set which is a superset of the true intervention targets. Our approach improves upon the state of the art as the returned candidate set is always a subset of the target set returned by previous work. Moreover, we do not require restrictive assumptions such as linearity of the causal model or performing invariance tests to learn whether a distribution is changing across environments which could be highly sample inefficient.

This limits its applicability in more complex scenarios, such as general semi-supervised learning and employing complex generative models as priors.

While existing works for this setting have provided algorithms that are guaranteed to identify a near-optimal safe action, the problem of attaining low cumulative regret has remained largely unexplored, with a key challenge being that expanding the safe region can incur high regret. To address this challenge, we show that if $g$ is monotone with respect to just the single variable $s$ (with no such constraint on $f$), sublinear regret becomes achievable with our proposed algorithm. In addition, we show that a modified version of our algorithm is able to attain sublinear regret (for suitably defined notions of regret) for the task of finding a near-optimal $s$ corresponding to every $x$, as opposed to only finding the global safe optimum.

We introduce a learning framework for multivariate TPPs leveraging recent progress on learning univariate TPPs via time-change theorems to propose a deep-learning, invertible model for the conditional intensity. We rely neither on Monte Carlo approximation for the compensator nor on thinning for sampling.

In this paper, we show that adopting the same methodology as in exact PSRL can be suboptimal under approximate inference. Motivated by the analysis, we propose an improved factorization for the posterior distribution of polices by removing the conditional independence between the policy and data given the model. By adopting such a posterior factorization, we further propose a general algorithmic framework for PSRL under approximate inference and a practical instantiation of it.

The proposed approach includes the shared long-term memory and workspace with finite capacity in which different specialized modules compete to write information. Later, crucial information from shared workspace is inscribed into long-term memory through outer product attention mechanism to reduce information conflict and build a knowledge reservoir, thereby facilitating subsequent inference, learning and problem-solving. We apply SDMTR to multi-modality question-answering and reasoning challenges, including text-based bAbI-20k, visual Sort-of-CLEVR and triangle relations detection tasks.

With the prevalence of deep learning, graph-based learning pattern in link prediction has been well-proven to successfully apply.

To tackle the above challenges, we propose using directed hypergraph to model the real world and design a directed hypergraph neural network framework for data representation learning. Specifically, our work can be concluded into two sophisticated aspects: (1) We define the approximate Laplacian of the directed hypergraph, and further formulate the convolution operation on the directed hypergraph structure, solving the issue of the directed hypergraph structure representation learning. (2) By efficiently learning complex information from directed hypergraphs to obtain high-quality representations, we develop a framework DHGNN for link prediction on directed hypergraph structures. We empirically show that the merit of DHGNN lies in its ability to model complex correlations and encode information effectively of directed hypergraphs.

This implicit bias is attributed to the specific noise structure inherent to SGD. When ensuring Differential Privacy (DP) in DNNs' training, DP-SGD adds Gaussian noise to the clipped gradients. However, large-batch training still leads to a significant performance decrease, posing a challenge as strong DP guarantees necessitate the use of massive batches. Our study first demonstrates that this phenomenon extends to Noisy-SGD (DP-SGD without clipping), suggesting that the stochasticity, not the clipping, is responsible for this implicit bias, even with additional isotropic Gaussian noise. We then theoretically analyze the solutions obtained with continuous versions of Noisy-SGD for the Linear Least Square and Diagonal Linear Network settings. Our analysis reveals that the additional noise indeed amplifies the implicit bias. It suggests that the performance issues of private training stem from the same underlying principles as SGD, offering hope for improvements in large batch training strategies",

In this paper, we consider a well-known Tucker tensor factorization and study its properties under the shared factor constraint. We call it a shared-factor Tucker factorization (SF-Tucker). Since sharing factors breaks polylinearity of classical tensor factorizations, common optimization schemes such as alternating least squares become inapplicable. Nevertheless, as we show in this paper, a set of fixed-rank SF-Tucker tensors preserves a Riemannian manifold structure. Therefore, we develop efficient algorithms for the main ingredients of Riemannian optimization on the SF-Tucker manifold and implement a Riemannian optimization method with momentum.

Pessimism, \\emph{i.e.}, avoiding uncertain states or actions during decision making, has long been the main theme for offline RL. However, existing works often lead to overly conservative policies with rather sub-optimal performance. To tackle this challenge, we introduce the notion of \\emph{lookahead pessimism} within the model-based offline RL paradigm. Intuitively, while the classical pessimism principle asks to terminate whenever the RL agent reaches an uncertain region, our method allows the agent to use a lookahead set carefully crafted from the learned model, and to make a move by properties of the lookahead set. Remarkably, we show that this enables learning a less conservative policy with a better performance guarantee. We refer to our method as Lookahead Pessimistic MDP (LP-MDP). Theoretically, we provide a rigorous analysis on the performance lower bound, which monotonically improves with the lookahead steps. Empirically, with the easy-to-implement design of LP-MDP, we demonstrate a solid performance improvement over baseline methods on widely used offline RL benchmarks",

Despite this general theory, practical nonlinear ICA algorithms have so far been mainly limited to data with one-dimensional latent dependencies, especially time-series data. In this paper, we introduce a new nonlinear ICA framework that employs $t$-process (TP) latent components which apply naturally to data with higher-dimensional dependency structures, such as spatial and spatio-temporal data. In particular, we develop a new learning and inference algorithm that extends variational inference methods to handle the combination of a deep neural network mixing function with the TP prior, and employs the method of inducing points for computational efficacy. On the theoretical side, we show that such TP independent components are identifiable under very general conditions. Further, Gaussian Process (GP) nonlinear ICA is established as a limit of the TP Nonlinear ICA model, and we prove that the identifiability of the latent components at this GP limit is more restricted. Namely, those components are identifiable if and only if they have distinctly different covariance kernels. Our algorithm and identifiability theorems are explored on simulated spatial data and real world spatio-temporal data",

    "abstract": "Many modern causal questions ask how treatments affect complex outcomes that are measured using wearable devices and sensors. Current analysis approaches require summarizing these data into scalar statistics (e.g., the mean), but these summaries can be misleading. For example, disparate distributions can have the same means, variances, and other statistics. Researchers can overcome the loss in information by instead representing the data as distributions. We develop an interpretable method for distributional data analysis that ensures trustworthy and robust decision making: Analyzing Distributional Data via Matching After Learning to Stretch (ADD MALTS). We (i) provide analytical guarantees of the correctness of our estimation strategy, (ii) demonstrate via simulation that ADD MALTS outperforms other distributional data analysis methods at estimating treatment effects, and (iii) illustrate ADD MALTS' ability to verify whether there is enough cohesion between treatment and control units within subpopulations to trustworthily estimate treatment effects.

However, due to their exorbitant computational costs, they can only be employed for a limited period and geographical area. To address this, we propose a more cost-effective method powered by an emerging machine learning approach to better understand the intricate dynamics of the climate system. Our approach involves active learning techniques by leveraging high-resolution climate simulation as an oracle that is queried based on an abundant amount of unlabeled data drawn from satellite observations. In particular, we aim to predict autoconversion rates, a crucial step in precipitation formation, while significantly reducing the need for a large number of labeled instances. In this study, we present novel methods: custom fusion query strategies for labeling instances – weight fusion (WiFi) and merge fusion (MeFi) – along with active feature selection based on SHAP.

To address this limitation, we propose MixupMP, a method that constructs a more realistic predictive distribution using popular data augmentation techniques. MixupMP operates as a drop-in replacement for deep ensembles, where each ensemble member is trained on a random simulation from this predictive distribution. Grounded in the recently-proposed framework of Martingale posteriors (Fong et al., 2023), MixupMP returns samples from an implicitly defined Bayesian posterior. Our empirical analysis showcases that MixupMP achieves superior predictive per- formance and uncertainty quantification on various image classification datasets, when compared with existing Bayesian and non-Bayesian approaches",

    "abstract": "The translation of Machine Learning (ML) research innovations to real-world applications and the maintenance of ML components are hindered by reoccurring challenges, such as reaching high predictive performance, robustness, complying with regulatory constraints, or meeting ethical standards. Many of these challenges are related to data quality and, in particular, to the lack of automation in data pipelines upstream of ML components. Automated data cleaning remains challenging since many approaches neglect the dependency structure of the data errors and require task-specific heuristics or human input for calibration. In this study, we develop and evaluate an application-agnostic ML-based data cleaning approach using well-established imputation techniques for automated detection and cleaning of erroneous values. To improve the degree of automation, we combine imputation techniques with conformal prediction (CP), a model-agnostic and distribution-free method to quantify and calibrate the uncertainty of ML models. Extensive empirical evaluations demonstrate that Conformal Data Cleaning (CDC) improves predictive performance in downstream ML tasks in the majority of cases.

Second, to account for the realistic scenario of using a sub-optimal discriminator, we derive a sequential Monte Carlo algorithm which iteratively takes the predictions from the discriminator into account during the generation process.

To tackle this issue, we propose a new constrained RL approach that searches for policy and constraint specifications together. This method features the adaptation of relaxing the constraint according to a relaxation cost introduced in the learning objective. Since this feature mimics how ecological systems adapt to disruptions by altering operation, our approach is termed as resilient constrained RL. Specifically, we provide a set of sufficient conditions that balance the constraint satisfaction and the reward maximization in notion of resilient equilibrium, propose a tractable formulation of resilient constrained policy optimization that takes this equilibrium as an optimal solution, and advocate two resilient constrained policy search algorithms with non-asymptotic convergence guarantees on the optimality gap and constraint satisfaction.

On-Demand FL composes a dataset of the target distribution, which we call the composite dataset, from a selected subset of local clients whose aggregate distribution is expected to emulate the target distribution as a whole. As the composite dataset consists of a precise yet diverse subset of clients reflecting the target distribution, the on-demand model trained with exactly enough selected clients becomes able to improve the model performance on the target distribution compared when trained with off-target and/or unknown distributions while reducing the number of participating clients and federating rounds. We model the target data distribution in terms of class and estimate the class distribution of each local client from the weight gradient of its local model.

We accomplish this by using meta-learning, considering both optimization- and model-based variants. Given a small context set to characterize the currently available expert, our framework can quickly adapt its deferral policy. For the model-based approach, we employ an attention mechanism that is able to look for points in the context set that are similar to a given test point, leading to an even more precise assessment of the expert's abilities.

However, a key limitation of QFF is that its performance can suffer from well-known pathologies related to highly oscillatory quadrature, resulting in mediocre approximation with limited features. We address this critical issue via a new Trigonometric Quadrature Fourier Feature (TQFF) method, which uses a novel non-Gaussian quadrature rule specifically tailored for the desired Fourier transform. We derive an exact quadrature rule for TQFF, along with kernel approximation error bounds for the resulting feature map.

In this work, we present a new convergence analysis of nonconvex SMD supporting general DGF, that overcomes the above limitations and relies solely on the standard assumptions. Moreover, our convergence is established with respect to the Bregman Forward-Backward envelope, which is a stronger measure than the commonly used squared norm of gradient mapping. We further extend our results to guarantee high probability convergence under sub-Gaussian noise and global convergence under the generalized Bregman Proximal Polyak-{Ł}ojasiewicz condition. Additionally, we illustrate the advantages of our improved SMD theory in various nonconvex machine learning tasks by harnessing nonsmooth DGFs.

    "title": "Cylindrical Thompson Sampling for High-Dimensional Bayesian Optimization",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Many industrial and scientific applications require optimization of one or more objectives by tuning dozens or hundreds of input parameters. While Bayesian optimization has been a popular approach for the efficient optimization of blackbox functions, its performance decreases drastically as the dimensionality of the search space increases (i.e., above twenty). Recent advancements in high-dimensional Bayesian optimization (HDBO) seek to mitigate this issue through techniques such as adaptive local search with trust regions or dimensionality reduction using random embeddings. In this paper, we provide a close examination of these advancements and show that sampling strategy plays a prominent role and is key to tackling the curse-of-dimensionality. We then propose cylindrical Thompson sampling (CTS), a novel strategy that can be integrated into single- and multi-objective HDBO algorithms. We demonstrate this by integrating CTS as a modular component in state-of-the-art HDBO algorithms. We verify the effectiveness of CTS on both synthetic and real-world high-dimensional problems, and show that CTS largely enhances existing HDBO methods",

However, formal analysis of history-based algorithms has been limited, with most existing frameworks concentrating on features without historical context.

    "abstract": "Black box variational inference has consistently produced impressive empirical results. Convergence guarantees require that the variational objective exhibits specific structural properties and that the noise of the gradient estimator can be controlled. In this work we study the smoothness and the variance of the gradient estimator for location-scale variational families with non-linear covariance parameterizations. Specifically, we derive novel theoretical results for the popular exponential covariance parameterization and tighter gradient variance bounds for the softplus parameterization. These results reveal the benefits of using non-linear scale parameterizations on large scale datasets. With a non-linear scale parameterization, the smoothness constant of the variational objective and the upper bound on the gradient variance decrease as the scale parameter becomes smaller. Learning posterior approximations with small scales is essential in Bayesian statistics with sufficient amount of data, since under appropriate assumptions, the posterior distribution is known to contract around the parameter of interest as the sample size increases. We validate our theoretical findings through empirical analysis on several large-scale datasets, underscoring the importance of non-linear parameterizations",

In this paper, we provide an extensive study on the conditions leading to PAC-Bayes bounds for non-linear RNNs that are independent of the length of the data.

We prove bounds that hold for \\emph{$\\beta$-saturated} and \\emph{DS $\\beta$-saturated} SRNs, classes of RNNs we introduce to formalize saturation regimes of RNNs. The first regime corresponds to the case where the values of the hidden state of the SRN are always close to the boundaries of the activation functions.

We follow this line of research and study the commonly-used averaged SGD algorithm, which has been empirically observed in Izmailov et al. (2018) to prefer a flat minimum and therefore achieves better generalization. We prove that in certain problem settings, averaged SGD can efficiently optimize the smoothed objective which avoids sharp local minima.

Conditional sampling has emerged as a powerful query model and has been investigated by theoreticians and practitioners alike, leading to the design of optimal algorithms albeit in a sequential setting (also referred to as adaptive tester). Given the profound impact of parallel computing over the past decades, there has been a strong desire to design algorithms that enable high parallelization. Despite significant algorithmic advancements over the last decade, parallelizable techniques (also termed non-adaptive testers) have $\\tilde{O}(\\log^{12}n)$ query complexity, a prohibitively large complexity to be of practical usage. Therefore, the primary challenge is whether it is possible to design algorithms that enable high parallelization while achieving efficient query complexity.

In our pursuit, we turn to Generalized Additive Models (GAMs), a widely used class of models known for their versatility across various domains. Although GAMs can capture non-linear relationships between variables and targets, they cannot capture intricate feature interactions. In this work, we investigate both of these challenges and propose a novel class of models, Shape Arithmetic Expressions (SHAREs), that fuses GAM's flexible shape functions with the complex feature interactions found in mathematical expressions.

To that effect, Chazel et al., (2018) proved that, under general conditions, the expected value of a random persistence diagram is a measure admitting a Lebesgue density, called the persistence intensity function. In this paper, we are concerned with estimating the persistence intensity function and a novel, normalized version of it – called the persistence density function. We present a class of kernel-based estimators based on an i.i.d. sample of persistence diagrams and derive estimation rates in the supremum norm.

So, the question arises of what is the best way to adapt the classifier to shifts in representation. Current methods only slowly change the classifier to representation shift, introducing noise into learning as the classifier is misaligned to the representation. We propose DeepCCG, an empirical Bayesian approach to solve this problem. DeepCCG works by updating the posterior of a class conditional Gaussian classifier such that the classifier adapts in one step to representation shift. The use of a class conditional Gaussian classifier also enables DeepCCG to use a log conditional marginal likelihood loss to update the representation. To perform the update to the classifier and representation, DeepCCG maintains a fixed number of examples in memory and so a key part of DeepCCG is selecting what examples to store, choosing the subset that minimises the KL divergence between the true posterior and the posterior induced by the subset. We explore the behaviour of DeepCCG in online continual learning (CL), demonstrating that it performs well against a spectrum of online CL methods and that it reduces the change in performance due to representation shift",

We focus on the general setting where the conditioned variable may be continuous, and the marginals of this variable in the two joint distributions may not be the same. In such settings, standard OT variants cannot be employed, and novel estimation techniques are necessary. Since the main challenge is that the conditional distributions are not explicitly available, the key idea in our OT formulation is to employ kernelized-least-squares terms computed over the joint samples, which implicitly match the transport plan's marginals with the empirical conditionals. Under mild conditions, we prove that our estimated transport plans, as a function of the conditioned variable, are asymptotically optimal. For finite samples, we show that the deviation in terms of our regularized objective is bounded by $O(m^{-1/4})$, where $m$ is the number of samples. We also discuss how the conditional transport plan could be modelled using explicit probabilistic models as well as using implicit generative ones. We empirically verify the consistency of our estimator on synthetic datasets, where the optimal plan is analytically known.

Our empirical results reveal that MixMIL outperforms existing MIL models in single-cell datasets, uncovering new associations and elucidating biological mechanisms across different domains",

    "abstract": "To tackle long planning horizon problems in reinforcement learning with general function approximation, we propose the first algorithm, termed as UCRL-WVTR, that achieves both \\emph{horizon-free} and \\emph{instance-dependent}, since it eliminates the polynomial dependency on the planning horizon. The derived regret bound is deemed \\emph{sharp}, as it matches the minimax lower bound when specialized to linear mixture MDPs up to logarithmic factors. Furthermore, UCRL-WVTR is \\emph{computationally efficient} with access to a regression oracle. The achievement of such a horizon-free, instance-dependent, and sharp regret bound hinges upon (i) novel algorithm designs: weighted value-targeted regression and a high-order moment estimator in the context of general function approximation; and (ii) fine-grained analysis: a novel concentration bound of weighted non-linear least squares and a refined analysis which leads to the tight instance-dependent bound. We also conduct comprehensive experiments to corroborate our theoretical findings",

    "abstract": "The Stochastic Extragradient (SEG) method is one of the most popular algorithms for solving finite-sum min-max optimization and variational inequality problems (VIPs) appearing in various machine learning tasks. However, existing convergence analyses of SEG focus on its with-replacement variants, while practical implementations of the method randomly reshuffle components and sequentially use them. Unlike the well-studied with-replacement variants, SEG with Random Reshuffling (SEG-RR) lacks established theoretical guarantees. In this work, we provide a convergence analysis of SEG-RR for three classes of VIPs: (i) strongly monotone, (ii) affine, and (iii) monotone. We derive conditions under which SEG-RR achieves a faster convergence rate than the uniform with-replacement sampling SEG. In the monotone setting, our analysis of SEG-RR guarantees convergence to an arbitrary accuracy without large batch sizes, a strong requirement needed in the classical with-replacement SEG. As a byproduct of our results, we provide convergence guarantees for Shuffle Once SEG (shuffles the data only at the beginning of the algorithm) and the Incremental Extragradient (does not shuffle the data). We supplement our analysis with experiments validating empirically the superior performance of SEG-RR over the classical with-replacement sampling SEG",

In this paper, we highlight the inherent limitations of cross-validation when employed to discern the structure of a Gaussian graphical model. We provide finite-sample bounds on the probability that the Lasso estimator for the neighborhood of a node within a Gaussian graphical model, optimized using a prediction oracle, misidentifies the neighborhood. Our results pertain to both undirected and directed acyclic graphs, encompassing general, sparse covariance structures. To support our theoretical findings, we conduct an empirical investigation of this inconsistency by contrasting our outcomes with other commonly used information criteria through an extensive simulation study. Given that many algorithms designed to learn the structure of graphical models require hyperparameter selection, the precise calibration of this hyperparameter is paramount for accurately estimating the inherent structure.

This novel class of oracles can query the gradient with any given data distribution, and is thus well suited to scenarios in which the training data distribution does not match the target (or test) distribution.

Scalable algorithms for learning kernel models need to be iterative in nature, but convergence can be slow due to poor conditioning. Spectral preconditioning is an important tool to speed-up the convergence of such iterative algorithms for training kernel models. However computing and storing a spectral preconditioner can be expensive which can lead to large computational and storage overheads, precluding the application of kernel methods to problems with large datasets. A Nystrom approximation of the spectral preconditioner is often cheaper to compute and store, and has demonstrated success in practical applications. In this paper we analyze the trade-offs of using such an approximated preconditioner. Specifically, we show that a sample of logarithmic size (as a function of the size of the dataset) enables the Nyström-based approximated preconditioner to accelerate gradient descent nearly as well as the exact preconditioner, while also reducing the computational and storage overheads",

However, in resource constrained settings, decision makers may only need a ranking of individuals based on their estimated CATE. In these scenarios, exact CATE estimation may be an unnecessarily challenging task, particularly when the underlying function is difficult to learn. In this work, we study the relationship between CATE estimation and optimizing for CATE ranking, demonstrating that optimizing for ranking may be more appropriate than optimizing for accuracy in certain settings. Guided by our analysis, we propose an approach to directly optimize for rankings of individuals to inform treatment assignment that aims to maximize benefit. Our tree-based approach maximizes the expected benefit of the treatment assignment using a novel splitting criteria. In an empirical case-study across synthetic datasets, our approach leads to better treatment assignments compared to CATE estimation methods as measured by expected total benefit. By providing a practical and efficient approach to learning a CATE ranking, this work offers an important step towards bridging the gap between CATE estimation techniques and their downstream applications",

This principle allows individuals to request that their personal data be deleted from deployed machine learning models.

As such, several machine unlearning methods have been proposed as efficient alternatives to retraining. These methods aim to approximate the predictive performance of retraining, but fail to consider how unlearning impacts other properties critical to real-world applications such as fairness. In this work, we demonstrate that most efficient unlearning methods cannot accommodate popular fairness interventions, and we propose the first fair machine unlearning method that can efficiently unlearn data instances from a fair objective. We derive theoretical results which demonstrate that our method can provably unlearn data and provably maintain fairness performance.

While these models may be confident during the training stage, they often falter in real-world testing scenarios due to the shift of these misleading correlations. Current solutions to this problem typically involve altering the correlations or regularizing latent representations. However, while these methods show promise in experiments, a rigorous theoretical understanding of their effectiveness and the underlying factors of spurious correlations is lacking. In this work, we provide a comprehensive theoretical analysis, supported by empirical evidence, to understand the intricacies of spurious correlations. Drawing on our proposed theorems, we investigate the behaviors of classifiers when confronted with spurious features, and present our findings on how various factors influence these correlations and their impact on model performances, including the Mahalanobis distance of groups, and training/testing spurious correlation ratios. Additionally, by aligning empirical outcomes with our theoretical discoveries, we highlight the feasibility of assessing the degree of separability of intertwined real-world features.

However, the practitioner is often constrained to just tens to hundreds of iterations, and the slow and/or inconsistent convergence of non-convex gradient descent can prevent a high-quality estimate from being obtained. Recently, the technique of \\emph{preconditioning} was shown to be highly effective at accelerating the local convergence of non-convex gradient descent when the measurements are noiseless. In this paper, we describe how preconditioning should be done for noisy measurements to accelerate local convergence to minimax optimality. For the symmetric matrix sensing problem, our proposed preconditioned method is guaranteed to locally converge to minimax error at a linear rate that is immune to ill-conditioning and/or over-parameterization.

It rests on a crucial assumption that we can write the treated unit as a linear combination of the untreated units. In practice, this assumption may not hold, and when violated, the resulting SC estimates are incorrect. This paper examines two questions: (1) How large can the misspecification error be? (2) How can we minimize it? First, we provide theoretical bounds to quantify the misspecification error. The bounds are comforting: small misspecifications induce small errors. With these bounds in hand, we develop new SC estimators specially designed to minimize misspecification error. The estimators are based on additional data about each unit. (E.g., if the units are countries, it might be demographic information about each.) We study our estimators on synthetic data; we find they produce more accurate causal estimates than standard SC. We then re-analyze the California tobacco program data of the original SC paper, now including additional data from the US census about per-state demographics. Our estimators show that the observations in the pre-treatment period lie within the bounds of misspecification error and that observations post-treatment lie outside of those bounds.

Nevertheless, a central fundamental question in this setup remained unresolved: how many data points must be observed so that any empirical risk minimizer (ERM) shows good performance on the true population? This question was proposed by Feldman who proved that $\\Omega(\\frac{d}{\\epsilon} + \\frac{1}{\\epsilon^2} )$ data points are necessary (where $d$ is the dimension and $\\epsilon > 0$ the accuracy parameter). Proving an $\\omega(\\frac{d}{\\epsilon} + \\frac{1}{\\epsilon^2})$ lower bound was left as an open problem. In this work we show that in fact $\\tilde{O}(\\frac{d}{\\epsilon} + \\frac{1}{\\epsilon^2})$ data points are also sufficient. This settles the question and yields a new separation between ERMs and uniform convergence. This sample complexity holds for the classical setup of learning bounded convex Lipschitz functions over the Euclidean unit ball. We further generalize the result and show that a similar upper bound holds for all symmetric convex bodies. The general bound is composed of two terms: (i) a term of the form $\\tilde{O}(\\frac{d}{\\epsilon})$ with an inverse-linear dependence on the accuracy parameter, and (ii) a term that depends on the statistical complexity of the class of linear functions (captured by the Rademacher complexity).

    "abstract": "Measuring diversity accurately is important for many scientific fields, including machine learning (ML), ecology, and chemistry. The Vendi Score was introduced as a generic similarity-based diversity metric that extends the Hill number of order $q=1$ by leveraging ideas from quantum statistical mechanics. Contrary to many diversity metrics in ecology, the Vendi Score accounts for similarity and does not require knowledge of the prevalence of the categories in the collection to be evaluated for diversity. However, the Vendi Score treats each item in a given collection with a level of sensitivity proportional to the item's prevalence. This is undesirable in settings where there is a significant imbalance in item prevalence. In this paper, we extend the other Hill numbers using similarity to provide flexibility in allocating sensitivity to rare or common items. This leads to a family of diversity metrics–Vendi scores with different levels of sensitivity controlled by the order $q$–that can be used in a variety of applications. We study the properties of the scores in a synthetic controlled setting where the ground truth diversity is known. We then test the utility of the Vendi scores in improving molecular simulations via Vendi Sampling. Finally, we use the scores to better understand the behavior of image generative models in terms of memorization, duplication, diversity, and sample quality",

We show in this work that cyclical MCMC converges to the desired probability distribution in settings where the Markov kernels used are fast mixing, and sufficiently long cycles are employed. However in the far more common settings of slow mixing kernels, the algorithm may fail to produce samples from the desired distribution. In particular, in a simple mixture example with unequal variance we show by simulation that cyclical MCMC fails to converge to the desired limit.

Model identification involves determining the order of the autoregressive and moving average components which is generally performed by inspection of the autocorrelation and partial autocorrelation functions or other offline methods.

A proximal block coordinate descent algorithm is then proposed to solve the underlying optimization problem efficiently.

In this paper, we provide a framework theoretically explaining this empirical observation. Based on convergence rates in Wasserstein distance of empirical measures, we show that, with high probability, two wide enough two-layer neural networks trained with stochastic gradient descent are linearly connected. Additionally, we express upper and lower bounds on the width of each layer of two deep neural networks with independent neuron weights to be linearly connected.

When the target has heavy tails, existing AIS algorithms can provide inconsistent estimators or exhibit slow convergence, as they often neglect the target's tail behaviour. To avoid this pitfall, we propose an AIS algorithm that approximates the target by Student-t proposal distributions. We adapt location and scale parameters by matching the escort moments - which are defined even for heavy-tailed distributions - of the target and proposal. These updates minimize the $\\alpha$-divergence between the target and the proposal, thereby connecting with variational inference. We then show that the $\\alpha$-divergence can be approximated by a generalized notion of effective sample size and leverage this new perspective to adapt the tail parameter with Bayesian optimization.

    "abstract": "Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB) systems are witnessing an upswing in applications within multi-agent distributed environments, leading to the advancement of collaborative MAB algorithms. In such settings, communication between agents executing actions and the primary learner making decisions can hinder the learning process. A prevalent challenge in distributed learning is action erasure, often induced by communication delays and/or channel noise. This results in agents possibly not receiving the intended action from the learner, subsequently leading to misguided feedback. In this paper, we introduce novel algorithms that enable learners to interact concurrently with distributed agents across heterogeneous action erasure channels with different action erasure probabilities. We illustrate that, in contrast to existing bandit algorithms, which experience linear regret, our algorithms assure sub-linear regret guarantees. Our proposed solutions are founded on a meticulously crafted repetition protocol and scheduling of learning across heterogeneous channels. To our knowledge, these are the first algorithms capable of effectively learning through heterogeneous action erasure channels. We substantiate the superior performance of our algorithm through numerical experiments, emphasizing their practical significance in addressing issues related to communication constraints and delays in multi-agent environments",

Within this framework, we establish conditions that guarantee the existence of optimal policies by considering the ordinal structure of the preferences.

While extensive research has been dedicated to \\emph{learning} causal graphs from data, its complementary concept of \\emph{testing} causal relationships has remained largely unexplored. While \\emph{learning} involves the task of recovering the Markov equivalence class (MEC) of the underlying causal graph from observational data, the \\emph{testing} counterpart addresses the following critical question: \\emph{Given a specific MEC and observational data from some causal graph, can we determine if the data-generating causal graph belongs to the given MEC?} We explore constraint-based testing methods by establishing bounds on the required number of conditional independence tests. Our bounds are in terms of the size of the maximum undirected clique ($s$) of the given MEC. In the worst case, we show a lower bound of $\\exp(\\Omega(s))$ independence tests. We then give an algorithm that resolves the task with $\\exp(O(s))$ tests, matching our lower bound. Compared to the \\emph{learning} problem, where algorithms often use a number of independence tests that is exponential in the maximum in-degree, this shows that \\emph{testing} is relatively easier. In particular, it requires exponentially less independence tests in graphs featuring high in-degrees and small clique sizes. Additionally, using the DAG associahedron, we provide a geometric interpretation of testing versus learning and discuss how our testing result can aid learning",

In this setting, we characterize the benefits and drawbacks of several alternative prediction strategies: the standard approach that directly predicts the long-term outcomes of interest, the proxy approach that directly predicts shorter-term proxy outcomes, and a hybrid approach that utilizes both the long-term policy outcome and (shorter-term) proxy outcome(s). We show that the hybrid approach is robust to the strength of the distribution shift and the proxy relationship.

In this work, we formalize the setup of timing-as-an-action. Through theoretical analysis in the tabular setting, we show that while the choice of delay intervals could be naively folded in as part of a composite action, these actions have a special structure and handling them intelligently yields statistical advantages. Taking a model-based perspective, these gains owe to the fact that delay actions do not add any parameters to the underlying model.

However, such a solution is resource-intensive as it entails recomputing after every visited location. A more practical approach is to design solutions with a small number of adaptive \"rounds\", where the robot recomputes only once at the start of each round. In this paper, we design an algorithm for IPP parameterized by the number k of adaptive rounds, and prove a smooth tradeoff between k and the solution quality (relative to fully adaptive solutions). We validate our theoretical results by experiments on a real road network, where we observe that a few rounds of adaptivity suffice to obtain solutions of cost almost as good as fully-adaptive ones",

    "abstract": "The multi-modal nature of neural loss landscapes is often considered to be the main driver behind the empirical success of deep ensembles. In this work, we probe this belief by constructing various \"connected\" ensembles which are restricted to lie in the same basin. Through our experiments, we demonstrate that increased connectivity indeed negatively impacts performance. However, when incorporating the knowledge from other basins implicitly through distillation, we show that the gap in performance can be mitigated by re-discovering (multi-basin) deep ensembles within a single basin. Thus, we conjecture that while the extra-basin knowledge is at least partially present in any given basin, it cannot be easily harnessed without learning it from other basins",

In this work, we focus on the recently introduced class of constrained Markov Potential Games. While centralized algorithms have been proposed for solving such constrained games, the design of converging independent learning algorithms tailored for the constrained setting remains an open question. We propose an independent policy gradient algorithm for learning approximate constrained Nash equilibria: Each agent observes their own actions and rewards, along with a shared state. Inspired by the optimization literature, our algorithm performs proximal-point-like updates augmented with a regularized constraint set. Each proximal step is solved inexactly using a stochastic switching gradient algorithm. Notably, our algorithm can be implemented independently without a centralized coordination mechanism requiring turn-based agent updates. Under some technical constraint qualification conditions, we establish convergence guarantees towards constrained approximate Nash equilibria. We perform simulations to illustrate our results",

In this work, we study the problem of extending such methods to settings with continuous actions, and explore multiple concrete approaches for performing this extension. As a case study, we consider the seminal FLAMBE algorithm (Agarwal et al., 2020), which is a reward-agnostic method for PAC RL with low-rank MDPs. We show that, without any modifications to the algorithm, we obtain a similar PAC bound when actions are allowed to be continuous. Specifically, when the model for transition functions satisfies a Hölder smoothness condition w.r.t. actions, and either the policy class has a uniformly bounded minimum density or the reward function is also Hölder smooth, we obtain a polynomial PAC bound that depends on the order of smoothness",

A good set of alternative routes offers meaningful options to the user of the system and can support applications such as routing that is robust to failures (e.g., road closures, extreme traffic congestion, etc.) and routing with diverse preferences and objective functions. Algorithmic techniques for alternative route computation include the penalty method, via-node type algorithms (which deploy bidirectional search and finding plateaus), and, more recently, electrical-circuit based algorithms. In this work we focus on the practically important family of via-node type algorithms and aim to produce high quality alternative routes for road networks using a novel deep learning-based approach that learns a representation of the underlying road network. We show that this approach can support natural objectives, such as the uniformly bounded stretch, that are difficult and computationally expensive to support through traditional algorithmic techniques. Moreover, we achieve this in a practical system based on the Customizable Route Planning (CRP) hierarchical routing architecture. Our training methodology uses the hierarchical partition of the graph and trains a model to predict which boundary nodes in the partition should be crossed by the alternative routes. We describe our methods in detail and evaluate them against previously studied baselines, showing quality improvements in the road networks of Seattle, Paris, and Bangalore",

[Konstantinov and Lampert, 2021] initiated the study of this question and presented negative results showing there exist data distributions where for several fairness constraints, any proper learner will exhibit high vulnerability when group sizes are imbalanced. Here, we present a more optimistic view, showing that if we allow randomized classifiers, then the landscape is much more nuanced. For example, for Demographic Parity we show we can incur only a $\\Theta(\\alpha)$ loss in accuracy, where $\\alpha$ is the malicious noise rate, matching the best possible even without fairness constraints. For Equal Opportunity, we show we can incur an $O(\\sqrt{\\alpha})$ loss, and give a matching $\\Omega(\\sqrt{\\alpha})$ lower bound. In contrast, [Konstantinov and Lampert, 2021] showed for proper learners the loss in accuracy for both notions is $\\Omega(1)$. The key technical novelty of our work is how randomization can bypass simple \"tricks\" an adversary can use to amplify his power. We also consider additional fairness notions including Equalized Odds and Calibration. For these fairness notions, the excess accuracy clusters into three natural regimes $O(\\alpha)$, $O(\\sqrt{\\alpha})$, and $O(1)$.

We present the KNN-KDE method introducing observation-specific kernels for KDE that are locally adapted through priors defined by the covariance of the K-nearest neighborhood, forming a fully Bayesian model with exact density estimates. We further derive a scalable inference procedure that infers parameters through variational inference by optimizing the predictive likelihood exploiting sparsity, batched optimization, and parallel computation for massive inference speedups. We find that KNN-KDE provides valid density estimates superior to conventional KDE and KNN density estimation on both synthetic and real data sets.

This is concerning, given that simulations reflect preconceptions about generating processes regarding noise distributions, model classes, and more. In this work, we propose a novel method for falsifying the output of a causal discovery algorithm in the absence of ground truth. Our key insight is that while statistical learning seeks stability across subsets of data points, causal learning should seek stability across subsets of variables. Motivated by this insight, our method relies on a notion of compatibility between causal graphs learned on different subsets of variables. We prove that detecting incompatibilities can falsify wrongly inferred causal relations due to violation of assumptions or errors from finite sample effects. Although passing such compatibility tests is only a necessary criterion for good performance, we argue that it provides strong evidence for the causal models whenever compatibility entails strong implications for the joint distribution. We also demonstrate experimentally that detection of incompatibilities can aid in causal model selection",

Accurately quantifying the uncertainty in the solutions to such problems is therefore critical for the rigorous interpretation of experimental results as well as for reliably using the reconstructed images as scientific evidence. Unfortunately, existing imaging methods are unable to quantify the uncertainty in the reconstructed images in a way that is robust to experiment replications. This paper presents a new uncertainty quantification methodology based on an equivariant formulation of the parametric bootstrap algorithm that leverages symmetries and invariance properties commonly encountered in imaging problems. Additionally, the proposed methodology is general and can be easily applied with any image reconstruction technique, including unsupervised training strategies that can be trained from observed data alone, thus enabling uncertainty quantification in situations where there is no ground truth data available. We demonstrate the proposed approach with a series of experiments and comparisons with alternative state-of-the-art uncertainty quantification strategies. In all our experiments, the proposed equivariant bootstrap delivers remarkably accurate high-dimensional confidence regions and outperforms the competing approaches in terms of estimation accuracy, uncertainty quantification accuracy, and computing time.

We give a positive answer for multi-encoder models where one of the encoders operates on public features. We develop new algorithms that take advantage of this separation by only protecting certain sufficient statistics (instead of adding noise to the gradient).

In this setting, we observe a sequence of independent samples from a discrete distribution that is changing over time, and the goal is to estimate the current distribution. Since we have access to only a single sample for each time step, a good estimation requires a careful choice of the number of past samples to use. To use more samples, we must resort to samples further in the past, and we incur a drift error due to the bias introduced by the change in distribution. On the other hand, if we use a small number of past samples, we incur a large statistical error as the estimation has a high variance. We present a novel adaptive algorithm that can solve this trade-off without any prior knowledge of the drift. Unlike previous adaptive results, our algorithm characterizes the statistical error using data-dependent bounds. This technicality enables us to overcome the limitations of the previous work that require a fixed finite support whose size is known in advance and that cannot change over time. Additionally, we can obtain tighter bounds depending on the complexity of the drifting distribution, and also consider distributions with infinite support",

    "title": "Efficient Reinforcement Learning for Routing Jobs in Heterogeneous Queueing Systems",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "We consider the problem of efficiently routing jobs that arrive into a central queue to a system of heterogeneous servers. Unlike homogeneous systems, a threshold policy, that routes jobs to the slow server(s) when the queue length exceeds a certain threshold, is known to be optimal for the one-fast-one-slow two-server system. But an optimal policy for the multi-server system is unknown and non-trivial to find. While Reinforcement Learning (RL) has been recognized to have great potential for learning policies in such cases, our problem has an exponentially large state space size, rendering standard RL inefficient. In this work, we propose ACHQ, an efficient policy gradient based algorithm with a low dimensional soft threshold policy parameterization that leverages the underlying queueing structure. We provide stationary-point convergence guarantees for the general case and despite the low-dimensional parameterization prove that ACHQ converges to an approximate global optimum for the special case of two servers. Simulations demonstrate an improvement in expected response time of up to ${\\sim}30%$ over the greedy policy that routes to the fastest available server",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Many problems in machine learning can be formulated as solving entropy-regularized optimal transport on the space of probability measures. The canonical approach involves the Sinkhorn iterates, renowned for their rich mathematical properties. Recently, the Sinkhorn algorithm has been recast within the mirror descent framework, thus benefiting from classical optimization theory insights. Here, we build upon this result by introducing a continuous-time analogue of the Sinkhorn algorithm. This perspective allows us to derive novel variants of Sinkhorn schemes that are robust to noise and bias. Moreover, our continuous-time dynamics offers a unified perspective on several recently discovered dynamics in machine learning and mathematics, such as the \"Wasserstein mirror flow\" of Deb et al. (2023) or the \"mean-field Schrödinger equation\" of Claisse et al. (2023)",

    "title": "SADI: Similarity-Aware Diffusion Model-Based Imputation for Incomplete Temporal EHR Data",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Missing values are prevalent in temporal electronic health records (EHR) data and are known to complicate data analysis and lead to biased results. The current state-of-the-art (SOTA) models for imputing missing values in EHR primarily leverage correlations across time points and across features, which perform well when data have strong correlation across time points, such as in ICU data where high-frequency time series data are collected. However, this is often insufficient for temporal EHR data from non-ICU settings (e.g., outpatient visits for primary care or specialty care), where data are collected at substantially sparser time points, resulting in much weaker correlation across time points. To address this methodological gap, we propose the Similarity-Aware Diffusion Model-Based Imputation (SADI), a novel imputation method that leverages the diffusion model and utilizes information across dependent variables. We apply SADI to impute incomplete temporal EHR data and propose a similarity-aware denoising function, which includes a self-attention mechanism to model the correlations between time points, features, and similar patients. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that the information of similar patients is directly used to construct imputation for incomplete temporal EHR data. Our extensive experiments on two datasets, the Critical Path For Alzheimer's Disease (CPAD) data and the PhysioNet Challenge 2012 data, show that SADI outperforms the current SOTA under various missing data mechanisms, including missing completely at random (MCAR), missing at random (MAR), and missing not at random (MNAR)",

We demonstrate how the task of learning a generative flow network can be efficiently redefined as an entropy-regularized RL problem with a specific reward and regularizer structure. Furthermore, we illustrate the practical efficiency of this reformulation by applying standard soft RL algorithms to GFlowNet training across several probabilistic modeling tasks.

Recent architectures learn complex temporal patterns by segmenting a time-series into patches and using the patches as tokens. The patch size controls the ability of transformers to learn the temporal patterns at different frequencies: shorter patches are effective for learning localized, high-frequency patterns, whereas mining long-term seasonalities and trends requires longer patches. Inspired by this observation, we propose a novel framework, Multi-resolution Time-Series Transformer (MTST), which consists of a multi-branch architecture for simultaneous modeling of diverse temporal patterns at different resolutions. In contrast to many existing time-series transformers, we employ relative positional encoding, which is better suited for extracting periodic components at different scales.

In many of those real-world applications, some of the information required to specify the relevant optimization problem is noisy, uncertain, and expensive to obtain. In this work, we study how much of that information needs to be queried in order to obtain an approximately optimal solution to the relevant problem. In particular, we focus on the shortest path problem in graphs with dynamic edge costs. We adopt the {\\em first passage percolation} model from probability theory wherein a graph $G'$ is derived from a weighted base graph $G$ by multiplying each edge weight by an independently chosen, random number in $[1, \\rho]$. Mathematicians have studied this model extensively when $G$ is a $d$-dimensional grid graph, but the behavior of shortest paths in this model is still poorly understood in general graphs. We make progress in this direction for a class of graphs that resemble real-world road networks. Specifically, we prove that if $G$ has a constant continuous doubling dimension, then for a given $s-t$ pair, we only need to probe the weights on $((\\rho \\log n )/ \\epsilon)^{O(1)}$ edges in $G'$ in order to obtain a $(1 + \\epsilon)$-approximation to the $s-t$ distance in $G'$.

Increasingly prevalent, too, are comparisons across modalities of data, such as neural network activations and training data or behavioral data and neurophysiological recordings. One approach to such comparisons involves measuring the dimensionality of the space shared between the paired data matrices, where dimensionality serves as a proxy for computational or representational complexity. Established approaches, including CCA, can be used to measure the number of shared embedding dimensions, however they do not account for potentially unequal variance along shared dimensions and so cannot measure effective shared dimensionality. We present a candidate measure for shared dimensionality that we call the effective number of shared dimensions (ENSD). The ENSD is an interpretable and computationally efficient model-free measure of shared dimensionality that can be used to probe shared structure in a wide variety of data types. We demonstrate the relative robustness of the ENSD in cases where data is sparse or low rank and illustrate how the ENSD can be applied in a variety of analyses of representational similarities across layers in convolutional neural networks and between brain regions",

    "abstract": "The run-time for optimization tools used in chip design has grown with the complexity of designs to the point where it can take several days to go through one design cycle which has become a bottleneck. Designers want fast tools that can quickly give feedback on a design. Using the input and output data of the tools from past designs, one can attempt to build a machine learning model that predicts the outcome of a design in significantly shorter time than running the tool. The accuracy of such models is affected by the representation of the design data, which is usually a netlist that describes the elements of the digital circuit and how they are connected. Graph representations for the netlist together with graph neural networks have been investigated for such models. However, the characteristics of netlists pose several challenges for existing graph learning frameworks, due to the large number of nodes and the importance of long-range interactions between nodes. To address these challenges, we represent the netlist as a directed hypergraph and propose a Directional Equivariant Hypergraph Neural Network (DE-HNN) for the effective learning of (directed) hypergraphs. Theoretically, we show that our DE-HNN can universally approximate any node or hyperedge based function that satisfies certain permutation equivariant and invariant properties natural for directed hypergraphs. We compare the proposed DE-HNN with several State-of-the-art (SOTA) machine learning models for (hyper)graphs and netlists, and show that the DE-HNN significantly outperforms them in predicting the outcome of optimized place-and-route tools directly from the input netlists",

For the former, we adopt a censoring-doubly-robust signal for the conditional average treatment effect (CATE) to facilitate an equivalence test of CATEs in OS and RCT, which serves as a proxy for testing if the validity assumptions hold. For the latter, we show that the same test can still be used even though unbiased CATE estimation may not be possible.

However, minimizing this objective is challenging. A popular existing approach, Reweighted Wake-Sleep (RWS), suffers from heavily biased gradients and a circular pathology that results in highly concentrated variational distributions. As an alternative, we propose SMC-Wake, a procedure for fitting an amortized variational approximation that uses likelihood-tempered sequential Monte Carlo samplers to estimate the gradient of the inclusive KL divergence. We propose three gradient estimators, all of which are asymptotically unbiased in the number of iterations and two of which are strongly consistent. Our method interleaves stochastic gradient updates, SMC samplers, and iterative improvement to an estimate of the normalizing constant to reduce bias from self-normalization. In experiments with both simulated and real datasets, SMC-Wake fits variational distributions that approximate the posterior more accurately than existing methods",

To address these issues, we propose a novel Tensor-view Topological Graph Neural Network (TTG-NN), a class of simple yet effective topological deep learning built upon persistent homology, graph convolution, and tensor operations. This new method incorporates tensor learning to simultaneously capture {\\it Tensor-view Topological} (TT), as well as Tensor-view Graph (TG) structural information on both local and global levels.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "A fundamental problem in decision-making systems is the presence of inequity along demographic lines. However, inequity can be difficult to quantify, particularly if our notion of equity relies on hard-to-measure notions like risk (e.g., equal access to treatment for those who would die without it). Auditing such inequity requires accurate measurements of individual risk, which is difficult to estimate in the realistic setting of unobserved confounding. In the case that these unobservables \"explain\" an apparent disparity, we may understate or overstate inequity. In this paper, we show that one can still give informative bounds on allocation rates among high-risk individuals, even while relaxing or (surprisingly) even when eliminating the assumption that all relevant risk factors are observed. We utilize the fact that in many real-world settings (e.g., the introduction of a novel treatment) we have data from a period prior to any allocation, to derive unbiased estimates of risk. We apply our framework to a real-world setting of Paxlovid allocation to COVID-19 patients, finding that observed racial inequity cannot be explained by unobserved confounders of the same strength as important observed covariates",

    "abstract": "Neural marked temporal point processes have been a valuable addition to the existing toolbox of statistical parametric models for continuous-time event data. These models are useful for sequences where each event is associated with a single item (a single type of event or a \"mark\")—but such models are not suited for the practical situation where each event is associated with a set of items. In this work, we develop a general framework for modeling set-valued data in continuous-time, compatible with any intensity-based recurrent neural point process model. In addition, we develop inference methods that can use such models to answer probabilistic queries such as \"the probability of item A being observed before item B,\" conditioned on sequence history. Computing exact answers for such queries is generally intractable for neural models due to both the continuous-time nature of the problem setting and the combinatorially-large space of potential outcomes for each event. To address this, we develop a class of importance sampling methods for querying with set-based sequences and demonstrate orders-of-magnitude improvements in efficiency over direct sampling via systematic experiments with four real-world datasets. We also illustrate how to use this framework to perform model selection using likelihoods that do not involve one-step-ahead prediction",

    "abstract": "Accurate estimation of conditional average treatment effects (CATE) is at the core of personalized decision making. While there is a plethora of models for CATE estimation, model selection is a non-trivial task, due to the fundamental problem of causal inference. Recent empirical work provides evidence in favor of proxy loss metrics with double robust properties and in favor of model ensembling. However, theoretical understanding is lacking. Direct application of prior theoretical works leads to suboptimal oracle model selection rates due to the non-convexity of the model selection problem. We provide regret rates for the major existing CATE ensembling approaches and propose a new CATE model ensembling approach based on $Q$-aggregation using the doubly robust loss. Our main result shows that causal $Q$-aggregation achieves statistically optimal oracle model selection regret rates of $\\log(M)/n$ (with $M$ models and $n$ samples), with the addition of higher-order estimation error terms related to products of errors in the nuisance functions. Crucially, our regret rate does not require that any of the candidate CATE models be close to the truth. We validate our new method on many semi-synthetic datasets and also provide extensions of our work to CATE model selection with instrumental variables and unobserved confounding",

To address these limitations, this paper proposes a novel Self-Supervised Quantization-Aware Knowledge Distillation (SQAKD) framework. SQAKD first unifies the forward and backward dynamics of various quantization functions, making it flexible for incorporating various QAT works. Then it formulates QAT as a co-optimization problem that simultaneously minimizes the KL-Loss between the full-precision and low-bit models for KD and the discretization error for quantization, without supervision from labels. A comprehensive evaluation shows that SQAKD substantially outperforms the state-of-the-art QAT and KD works for a variety of model architectures.

    "title": "FALCON: FLOP-Aware Combinatorial Optimization for Neural Network Pruning",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "The increasing computational demands of modern neural networks present deployment challenges on resource-constrained devices. Network pruning offers a solution to reduce model size and computational cost while maintaining performance. However, current pruning methods focus primarily on improving sparsity by reducing the number of nonzero parameters, often neglecting other deployment costs such as inference time, which are closely related to the number of floating-point operations (FLOPs). In this paper, we propose {FALCON}, a novel combinatorial-optimization-based framework for network pruning that jointly takes into account model accuracy (fidelity), FLOPs, and sparsity constraints. A main building block of our approach is an integer linear program (ILP) that simultaneously handles FLOP and sparsity constraints. We present a novel algorithm to approximately solve the ILP. We propose a novel first-order method for our optimization framework which makes use of our ILP solver. Using problem structure (e.g., the low-rank structure of approx. Hessian), we can address instances with millions of parameters. Our experiments demonstrate that {FALCON} achieves superior accuracy compared to other pruning approaches within a fixed FLOP budget. For instance, for ResNet50 with 20% of the total FLOPs retained, our approach improves the accuracy by 48% relative to state-of-the-art. Furthermore, in gradual pruning settings with re-training between pruning steps, our framework outperforms existing pruning methods, emphasizing the significance of incorporating both FLOP and sparsity constraints for effective network pruning",

    "abstract": "Second-order optimization methods, such as cubic regularized Newton methods, are known for their rapid convergence rates; nevertheless, they become impractical in high-dimensional problems due to their substantial memory requirements and computational costs. One promising approach is to execute second-order updates within a lower-dimensional subspace, giving rise to subspace second-order methods. However, the majority of existing subspace second-order methods randomly select subspaces, consequently resulting in slower convergence rates depending on the problem's dimension $d$. In this paper, we introduce a novel subspace cubic regularized Newton method that achieves a dimension-independent global convergence rate of $\\mathcal{O}\\left(\\frac{1}{mk}+\\frac{1}{k^2}\\right)$ for solving convex optimization problems. Here, $m$ represents the subspace dimension, which can be significantly smaller than $d$. Instead of adopting a random subspace, our primary innovation involves performing the cubic regularized Newton update within the \\emph{Krylov subspace} associated with the Hessian and the gradient of the objective function. This result marks the first instance of a dimension-independent convergence rate for a subspace second-order method. Furthermore, when specific spectral conditions of the Hessian are met, our method recovers the convergence rate of a full-dimensional cubic regularized Newton method.

Though safe, such approaches lose any convergence guarantees enjoyed by the underlying RL methods. In this paper, we develop a single-stage, sampling-based approach to hard constraint satisfaction that learns RL controllers enjoying classical convergence guarantees while satisfying hard safety constraints throughout training and deployment.

    "abstract": "The prevalent deployment of learning from human preferences through reinforcement learning (RLHF) relies on two important approximations: the first assumes that pairwise preferences can be substituted with pointwise rewards. The second assumes that a reward model trained on these pointwise rewards can generalize from collected data to out-of-distribution data sampled by the policy. Recently, Direct Preference Optimisation DPO has been proposed as an approach that bypasses the second approximation and learn directly a policy from collected data without the reward modelling stage. However, this method still heavily relies on the first approximation. In this paper we try to gain a deeper theoretical understanding of these practical algorithms. In particular we derive a new general objective called ${\\Psi}$PO for learning from human preferences that is expressed in terms of pairwise preferences and therefore bypasses both approximations. This new general objective allows us to perform an in-depth analysis of the behavior of RLHF and DPO (as special cases of ${\\Psi}$PO) and to identify their potential pitfalls. We then consider another special case for ${\\Psi}$PO by setting $\\Psi$ simply to Identity, for which we can derive an efficient optimisation procedure, prove performance guarantees and demonstrate its empirical superiority to DPO on some illustrative examples",

We apply our new confidence set to the regret analyses of logistic bandits with a new martingale concentration step that circumvents an additional factor of $S$. We then extend this analysis to multinomial logistic bandits and obtain similar improvements in the regret, showing the efficacy of R2CS.

PoEs have found a variety of applications in learning. We study the problem of identifiability of a product of experts model having a layer of binary latent variables, and a layer of binary observables that are iid conditional on the latents. The previous best upper bound on the number of observables needed to identify the model was exponential in the number of parameters. We show: (a) When the latents are uniformly distributed, the model is identifiable with a number of observables equal to the number of parameters (and hence best possible). (b) In the more general case of arbitrarily distributed latents, the model is identifiable for a number of observables that is still linear in the number of parameters (and within a factor of two of best-possible). The proofs rely on root interlacing phenomena for some special three-term recurrences",

    "abstract": "Double-descent refers to the unexpected drop in test loss of a learning algorithm beyond an interpolating threshold with over-parameterization, which is not predicted by information criteria in their classical forms due to the limitations in the standard asymptotic approach. We update these analyses using the information risk minimization framework and provide Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) and Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) for models learned by the Gibbs algorithm. Notably, the penalty terms for the Gibbs-based AIC and BIC correspond to specific information measures, i.e., symmetrized KL information and KL divergence. We extend this information-theoretic analysis to over-parameterized models by providing two different Gibbs-based BICs to compute the marginal likelihood of random feature models in the regime where the number of parameters $p$ and the number of samples $n$ tend to infinity, with $p/n$ fixed. Our experiments demonstrate that the Gibbs-based BIC can select the high-dimensional model and reveal the mismatch between marginal likelihood and population risk in the over-parameterized regime, providing new insights to understand double-descent",

    "title": "Improving Robustness via Tilted Exponential Layer: A Communication-Theoretic Perspective",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "State-of-the-art techniques for enhancing robustness of deep networks mostly rely on empirical risk minimization with suitable data augmentation. In this paper, we propose a complementary approach motivated by communication theory, aimed at enhancing the signal-to-noise ratio at the output of a neural network layer via neural competition during learning and inference. In addition to standard empirical risk minimization, neurons compete to sparsely represent layer inputs by maximization of a tilted exponential (TEXP) objective function for the layer. TEXP learning can be interpreted as maximum likelihood estimation of matched filters under a Gaussian model for data noise. Inference in a TEXP layer is accomplished by replacing batch norm by a tilted softmax, which can be interpreted as computation of posterior probabilities for the competing signaling hypotheses represented by each neuron. After providing insights via simplified models, we show, by experimentation on standard image datasets, that TEXP learning and inference enhances robustness against noise and other common corruptions, without requiring data augmentation. Further cumulative gains in robustness against this array of distortions can be obtained by appropriately combining TEXP with data augmentation techniques.

    "abstract": "Recent advances in unsupervised learning have shown that unsupervised pre-training, followed by fine-tuning, can improve model generalization. However, a rigorous understanding of how the representation function learned on an unlabeled dataset affects the generalization of the fine-tuned model is lacking. Existing theoretical research does not adequately account for the heterogeneity of the distribution and tasks in pre-training and fine-tuning stage. To bridge this gap, this paper introduces a novel theoretical framework that illuminates the critical factor influencing the transferability of knowledge acquired during unsupervised pre-training to the subsequent fine-tuning phase, ultimately affecting the generalization capabilities of the fine-tuned model on downstream tasks. We apply our theoretical framework to analyze generalization bound of two distinct scenarios: Context Encoder pre-training with deep neural networks and Masked Autoencoder pre-training with deep transformers, followed by fine-tuning on a binary classification task. Finally, inspired by our findings, we propose a novel regularization method during pre-training to further enhances the generalization of fine-tuned model. Overall, our results contribute to a better understanding of unsupervised pre-training and fine-tuning paradigm, and can shed light on the design of more effective pre-training algorithms",

However, much less work has been done on signal classification, where the data consists of many functions (referred to as signals) defined on the vertices of a single graph. These tasks require networks designed differently from those designed for traditional GNN tasks. Indeed, traditional GNNs rely on localized low-pass filters, and signals of interest may have intricate multi-frequency behavior and exhibit long range interactions. This motivates us to introduce the BLIS-Net (Bi-Lipschitz Scattering Net), a novel GNN that builds on the previously introduced geometric scattering transform. Our network is able to capture both local and global signal structure and is able to capture both low-frequency and high-frequency information. We make several crucial changes to the original geometric scattering architecture which we prove increase the ability of our network to capture information about the input signal and show that BLIS-Net achieves superior performance on both synthetic and real-world data sets based on traffic flow and fMRI data",

    "abstract": "We consider the problem of reward maximization in the dueling bandit setup along with constraints on resource consumption. As in the classic dueling bandits, at each round the learner has to choose a pair of items from a set of $K$ items and observe a relative feedback for the current pair. Additionally, for both items, the learner also observes a vector of resource consumptions. The objective of the learner is to maximize the cumulative reward, while ensuring that the total consumption of any resource is within the allocated budget. We show that due to the relative nature of the feedback, the problem is more difficult than its bandit counterpart and that without further assumptions the problem is not learnable from a regret minimization perspective. Thereafter, by exploiting assumptions on the available budget, we provide an EXP3 based dueling algorithm that also considers the associated consumptions and show that it achieves an $\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}\\left(\\big({\\frac{OPT^{(b)}}{B}}+1\\big)K^{1/3}T^{2/3}\\right)$ regret, where $OPT^{(b)}$ is the optimal value and $B$ is the available budget.

Existing BO methods for Pareto optimization in the presence of IU are risk-specific or without theoretical guarantees, whereas our proposed method addresses general risk measures and has theoretical guarantees. The basic idea of the proposed method is to assume a Gaussian process (GP) model for the black-box function and to construct high-probability bounding boxes for the risk measures using the GP model. Furthermore, in order to reduce the uncertainty of non-dominated bounding boxes, we propose a method of selecting the next evaluation point using a maximin distance defined by the maximum value of a quasi distance based on bounding boxes. As theoretical analysis, we prove that the algorithm can return an arbitrary-accurate solution in a finite number of iterations with high probability, for various risk measures such as Bayes risk, worst-case risk, and value-at-risk. We also give a theoretical analysis that takes into account approximation errors because there exist non-negligible approximation errors (e.g., finite approximation of PFs and sampling-based approximation of bounding boxes) in practice. We confirm that the proposed method performs as well or better than existing methods not only in the setting with IU but also in the setting of ordinary MOBO through numerical experiments",

To address this issue, we propose a new uncertainty-aware and interpretable graph classification model that combines graph functional neural process and graph generative model. The core of our method is to assume a set of latent rationales which can be mapped to a probabilistic embedding space; the predictive distribution of the classifier is conditioned on such rationale embeddings by learning a stochastic correlation matrix. The graph generator serves to decode the graph structure of the rationales from the embedding space for model interpretability. For efficient model training, we adopt an alternating optimization procedure which mimics the well known Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm. The proposed method is general and can be applied to any existing GNN architecture. Extensive experiments on five graph classification datasets demonstrate that our framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both uncertainty quantification and GNN interpretability.

We prove that autoMALA has the correct invariant distribution, despite continual automatic adjustments of the step size. Our experiments demonstrate that autoMALA is competitive with related state-of-the-art MCMC methods, in terms of the number of log density evaluations per effective sample, and it outperforms state-of-the-art samplers on targets with varying geometries.

The objective is to optimize a reward function via minimizing a measure of cumulative regret with respect to the best sequence of interventions in hindsight. The paper advances the results on CBs in three directions. First, the structural causal models (SCMs) are assumed to be unknown and drawn arbitrarily from a general class $\\mathcal{F}$ of Lipschitz-continuous functions. Existing results are often focused on (generalized) linear SCMs. Second, the interventions are assumed to be generalized soft with any desired level of granularity, resulting in an infinite number of possible interventions. The existing literature, in contrast, generally adopts atomic and hard interventions. Third, we provide general upper and lower bounds on regret. The upper bounds subsume (and improve) known bounds for special cases. The lower bounds are generally hitherto unknown. These bounds are characterized as functions of the (i) graph parameters, (ii) eluder dimension of the space of SCMs, denoted by $\\mathrm{dim}(\\mathcal{F})$, and (iii) the covering number of the function space, denoted by $\\mathrm{cn}(\\mathcal{F})$. Specifically, the cumulative achievable regret over horizon $T$ is $\\mathcal{O}(K d^{L-1}\\sqrt{T\\,\\mathrm{dim}(\\mathcal{F}) \\log(\\mathrm{cn}(\\mathcal{F}))})$, where $K$ is related to the Lipschitz constants, $d$ is the graph's maximum in-degree, and $L$ is the length of the longest causal path.

Porting such techniques to computational models in the social sciences brings into sharp relief their limitations in dealing with discontinuous simulators, such as Agent-Based Models, which have discrete outputs. Nevertheless, prior applied work has shown that surrogate estimates of active subspaces for such estimators can yield interesting results. But given that active subspaces are defined by way of gradients, it is not clear what quantity is being estimated when this methodology is applied to a discontinuous simulator. We begin this article by showing some pathologies that can arise when conducting such an analysis. This motivates an extension of active subspaces to discontinuous functions, clarifying what is actually being estimated in such analyses. We also conduct numerical experiments on synthetic test functions to compare Gaussian process estimates of active subspaces on continuous and discontinuous functions.

We call such a DAG underlying an LDS as dynamical DAG (DDAG). In particular, we consider a DDAG where the nodal dynamics are driven by unobserved exogenous noise sources that are wide-sense stationary (WSS) in time but are mutually uncorrelated, and have the same power spectral density (PSD). Inspired by the static DAG setting, a metric and an algorithm based on the PSD matrix of the observed time series are proposed to reconstruct the DDAG. It is shown that the optimal sample complexity (or length of state trajectory) needed to learn the DDAG is $n=\\Theta(q\\log(p/q))$, where $p$ is the number of nodes and $q$ is the maximum number of parents per node. To prove the sample complexity upper bound, a concentration bound for the PSD estimation is derived, under two different sampling strategies. A matching min-max lower bound using generalized Fano's inequality also is provided, thus showing the order optimality of the proposed algorithm.

    "abstract": "This paper introduces AL$\\ell_0$CORE, a new form of probabilistic non-negative tensor decomposition. AL$\\ell_0$CORE is a Tucker decomposition that constrains the number of non-zero elements (i.e., the $\\ell_0$-norm) of the core tensor to be at most $Q$. While the user dictates the total budget $Q$, the locations and values of the non-zero elements are latent variables allocated across the core tensor during inference. AL$\\ell_0$CORE—i.e., allocated $\\ell_0$-constrained core—thus enjoys both the computational tractability of canonical polyadic (CP) decomposition and the qualitatively appealing latent structure of Tucker. In a suite of real-data experiments, we demonstrate that AL$\\ell_0$CORE typically requires only tiny fractions (e.g., 1%) of the core to achieve the same results as Tucker at a correspondingly small fraction of the cost",

    "title": "Adaptive Federated Minimax Optimization with Lower Complexities",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Federated learning is a popular distributed and privacy-preserving learning paradigm in machine learning. Recently, some federated learning algorithms have been proposed to solve the distributed minimax problems. However, these federated minimax algorithms still suffer from high gradient or communication complexity. Meanwhile, few algorithm focuses on using adaptive learning rate to accelerate these algorithms. To fill this gap, in the paper, we study a class of nonconvex minimax optimization, and propose an efficient adaptive federated minimax optimization algorithm (i.e., AdaFGDA) to solve these distributed minimax problems. Specifically, our AdaFGDA builds on the momentum-based variance reduced and local-SGD techniques, and it can flexibly incorporate various adaptive learning rates by using the unified adaptive matrices. Theoretically, we provide a solid convergence analysis framework for our AdaFGDA algorithm under non-i.i.d. setting. Moreover, we prove our AdaFGDA algorithm obtains a lower gradient (i.e., stochastic first-order oracle, SFO) complexity of $\\tilde{O}(\\epsilon^{-3})$ with lower communication complexity of $\\tilde{O}(\\epsilon^{-2})$ in finding $\\epsilon$-stationary point of the nonconvex minimax problems. Experimentally, we conduct some experiments on the deep AUC maximization and robust neural network training tasks to verify efficiency of our algorithms",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Long-term time series forecasting (LTSF) aims to predict future values of a time series given the past values. The current state-of-the-art (SOTA) on this problem is attained in some cases by linear-centric models, which primarily feature a linear mapping layer. However, due to their inherent simplicity, they are not able to adapt their prediction rules to periodic changes in time series patterns. To address this challenge, we propose a Mixture-of-Experts-style augmentation for linear-centric models and propose Mixture-of-Linear-Experts (MoLE). Instead of training a single model, MoLE trains multiple linear-centric models (i.e., experts) and a router model that weighs and mixes their outputs. While the entire framework is trained end-to-end, each expert learns to specialize in a specific temporal pattern, and the router model learns to compose the experts adaptively. Experiments show that MoLE reduces forecasting error of linear-centric models, including DLinear, RLinear, and RMLP, in over 78% of the datasets and settings we evaluated. By using MoLE existing linear-centric models can achieve SOTA LTSF results in 68% of the experiments that PatchTST reports and we compare to, whereas existing single-head linear-centric models achieve SOTA results in only 25% of cases",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "In one view of the classical game of prediction with expert advice with binary outcomes, in each round, each expert maintains an adversarially chosen belief and honestly reports this belief. We consider a recently introduced, strategic variant of this problem with selfish (reputation-seeking) experts, where each expert strategically reports in order to maximize their expected future reputation based on their belief. In this work, our goal is to design an algorithm for the selfish experts problem that is incentive-compatible (IC, or \\emph{truthful}), meaning each expert's best strategy is to report truthfully, while also ensuring the algorithm enjoys sublinear regret with respect to the expert with the best belief. Freeman et al. (2020) recently studied this problem in the full information and bandit settings and obtained truthful, no-regret algorithms by leveraging prior work on wagering mechanisms. While their results under full information match the minimax rate for the classical (\"honest experts\") problem, the best-known regret for their bandit algorithm WSU-UX is $O(T^{2/3})$, which does not match the minimax rate for the classical (\"honest bandits\") setting. It was unclear whether the higher regret was an artifact of their analysis or a limitation of WSU-UX. We show, via explicit construction of loss sequences, that the algorithm suffers a worst-case $\\Omega(T^{2/3})$ lower bound. Left open is the possibility that a different IC algorithm obtains $O(\\sqrt{T})$ regret. Yet, WSU-UX was a natural choice for such an algorithm owing to the limited design room for IC algorithms in this setting",

Our proposed algorithm achieves calibration and accuracy at a faster rate than existing techniques (Kuleshov and Ermon, 2017) and is the first algorithm to offer a flexible tradeoff between calibration error and accuracy in the online setting.

Recent state-of-the-art achieved accurate prediction using deep neural networks. However, these end-to-end models are usually black boxes with weak interpretability and generalizability. This paper proposes the Goal-based Neural Variational Agent (GNeVA), an interpretable generative model for motion prediction with robust generalizability to out-of-distribution cases. For interpretability, the model achieves target-driven motion prediction by estimating the spatial distribution of long-term destinations with a variational mixture of Gaussians. We identify a causal structure among maps and agents' histories and derive a variational posterior to enhance generalizability. Experiments on motion prediction datasets validate that the fitted model can be interpretable and generalizable and can achieve comparable performance to state-of-the-art results",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Large language models exhibit strong multitasking capabilities, however, their learning dynamics as a function of task characteristics, sample size, and model complexity remain mysterious. For instance, it is known that, as the model size grows, large language models exhibit emerging abilities where certain tasks can abruptly jump from poor to respectable performance. Such phenomena motivate a deeper understanding of how individual tasks evolve during multitasking. To this aim, we study a multitask representation learning setup where tasks can have distinct distributions, quantified by their covariance priors. Through random matrix theory, we precisely characterize the optimal linear representation for few-shot learning that minimizes the average test risk in terms of task covariances. When tasks have equal sample sizes, we prove a reduction to an equivalent problem with a single effective covariance from which the individual task risks of the original problem can be deduced. Importantly, we introduce \"task competition\" to explain how tasks with dominant covariance eigenspectrum emerge faster than others. We show that task competition can potentially explain the inverse scaling of certain tasks i.e. reduced test accuracy as the model grows. Overall, this work sheds light on the risk and emergence of individual tasks and uncovers new high-dimensional phenomena (including multiple-descent risk curves) that arise in multitask representation learning",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "The problem of minimizing the sum of $n$ functions in $d$ dimensions is ubiquitous in machine learning and statistics. In many applications where the number of observations $n$ is large, it is necessary to use incremental or stochastic methods, as their per-iteration cost is independent of $n$. Of these, Quasi-Newton (QN) methods strike a balance between the per-iteration cost and the convergence rate. Specifically, they exhibit a superlinear rate with $O(d^2)$ cost in contrast to the linear rate of first-order methods with $O(d)$ cost and the quadratic rate of second-order methods with $O(d^3)$ cost. However, existing incremental methods have notable shortcomings: Incremental Quasi-Newton (IQN) only exhibits asymptotic superlinear convergence. In contrast, Incremental Greedy BFGS (IGS) offers explicit superlinear convergence but suffers from poor empirical performance and has a per-iteration cost of $O(d^3)$. To address these issues, we introduce the Sharpened Lazy Incremental Quasi-Newton Method (SLIQN) that achieves the best of both worlds: an explicit superlinear convergence rate, and superior empirical performance at a per-iteration $O(d^2)$ cost. SLIQN features two key changes: first, it incorporates a hybrid strategy of using both classic and greedy BFGS updates, allowing it to empirically outperform both IQN and IGS. Second, it employs a clever constant multiplicative factor along with a lazy propagation strategy, which enables it to have a cost of $O(d^2)$. Additionally, our experiments demonstrate the superiority of SLIQN over other incremental and stochastic Quasi-Newton variants and establish its competitiveness with second-order incremental methods",

However, due to their discrete and highly non-differentiable nature, training SNNs is a challenging task and remains an active area of research. Some of the most prominent ways to train SNNs are based on ANN-to-SNN conversion where an SNN model is initialized with parameters from the corresponding, pre-trained ANN model. SNN models trained through ANN-to-SNN conversion or hybrid training show state of the art performance among SNNs on many machine learning tasks, comparable to those of ANNs. However, the top performing models need high latency or tailored ANNs to perform well, and in general are not using the full information available from ANNs. In this work, we propose novel method to initialize SNN's thresholds and initial membrane potential after ANN-to-SNN conversion, using distributions of ANN's activation values. We provide a theoretical framework for feature distribution-based conversion error, providing theoretical results on optimal membrane initialization and thresholds which minimize this error, as well as a practical algorithm for finding these optimal values. We test our method, both as a stand-alone ANN-to-SNN conversion and in combination with other methods, and show state of the art results on high-dimensional datasets such as CIFAR10, CIFAR100 and ImageNet and various architectures.

This assertion was purportedly debunked and rebounded to the Gaussian noise model that had been previously proposed. This study provides robust, comprehensive empirical evidence that SGN is heavy-tailed and is better represented by the $S\\alpha S$ distribution. Our experiments include several datasets and multiple models, both discriminative and generative. Furthermore, we argue that different network parameters preserve distinct SGN properties. We develop a novel framework based on a Lévy-driven stochastic differential equation (SDE), where one-dimensional Lévy processes describe each parameter. This leads to a more accurate characterization of the dynamics of SGD around local minima. We use our framework to study SGD properties near local minima; these include the mean escape time and preferable exit directions",

In general, the task of inferring latent differentiation structures is very difficult to handle due to two interrelated settings. One is that the conversion mechanism between hidden structure and often higher dimensional observations is unknown (and is a complex mechanism). The other is that the topology of the hidden diffuse structure itself is unknown. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a BNP-based strategy as a natural way to deal with these two challenging settings simultaneously. Specifically, as an extension of the Gaussian process latent variable model, we propose a model in which the black box transformation from latent variable space to observed data space is represented by a Gaussian process, and introduce a BNP diffusion model for the latent variable space. We show its application to the visualization of the diffusion structure of media information and to the task of inferring cell differentiation structure from single-cell gene expression levels",

    "title": "Random Oscillators Network for Time Series Processing",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "We introduce the Random Oscillators Network (RON), a physically-inspired recurrent model derived from a network of heterogeneous oscillators. Unlike traditional recurrent neural networks, RON keeps the connections between oscillators untrained by leveraging on smart random initialisations, leading to exceptional computational efficiency. A rigorous theoretical analysis finds the necessary and sufficient conditions for the stability of RON, highlighting the natural tendency of RON to lie at the edge of stability, a regime of configurations offering particularly powerful and expressive models. Through an extensive empirical evaluation on several benchmarks, we show four main advantages of RON. 1) RON shows excellent long-term memory and sequence classification ability, outperforming other randomised approaches. 2) RON outperforms fully-trained recurrent models and state-of-the-art randomised models in chaotic time series forecasting. 3) RON provides expressive internal representations even in a small parametrisation regime making it amenable to be deployed on low-powered devices and at the edge. 4) RON is up to two orders of magnitude faster than fully-trained models",

    "title": "Mitigating Underfitting in Learning to Defer with Consistent Losses",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Learning to defer (L2D) allows the classifier to defer its prediction to an expert for safer predictions, by balancing the system's accuracy and extra costs incurred by consulting the expert. Various loss functions have been proposed for L2D, but they were shown to cause the underfitting of trained classifiers when extra consulting costs exist, resulting in degraded performance. In this paper, we propose a novel loss formulation that can mitigate the underfitting issue while remaining the statistical consistency. We first show that our formulation can avoid a common characteristic shared by most existing losses, which has been shown to be a cause of underfitting, and show that it can be combined with the representative losses for L2D to enhance their performance and yield consistent losses. We further study the regret transfer bounds of the proposed losses and experimentally validate its improvements over existing methods",

    "title": "Consistent Hierarchical Classification with A Generalized Metric",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "In multi-class hierarchical classification, a natural evaluation metric is the tree distance loss that takes the value of two labels' distance on the pre-defined tree hierarchy. This metric is motivated by that its Bayes optimal solution is the deepest label on the tree whose induced superclass (subtree rooted at it) includes the true label with probability at least $\\frac{1}{2}$. However, it can hardly handle the risk sensitivity of different tasks since its accuracy requirement for induced superclasses is fixed at $\\frac{1}{2}$. In this paper, we first introduce a new evaluation metric that generalizes the tree distance loss, whose solution's accuracy constraint $\\frac{1+c}{2}$ can be controlled by a penalty value $c$ tailored for different tasks: a higher c indicates the emphasis on prediction's accuracy and a lower one indicates that on specificity. Then, we propose a novel class of consistent surrogate losses based on an intuitive presentation of our generalized metric and its regret, which can be compatible with various binary losses. Finally, we theoretically derive the regret transfer bounds for our proposed surrogates and empirically validate their usefulness on benchmark datasets",

While advanced optimization methods exist for such problems, characterizing their dynamics in stochastic scenarios remains notably challenging. In this paper, we pioneer the use of stochastic differential equations (SDEs) to analyze and compare Minimax optimizers. Our SDE models for Stochastic Gradient Descent-Ascent, Stochastic Extragradient, and Stochastic Hamiltonian Gradient Descent are provable approximations of their algorithmic counterparts, clearly showcasing the interplay between hyperparameters, implicit regularization, and implicit curvature-induced noise. This perspective also allows for a unified and simplified analysis strategy based on the principles of Itô calculus.

    "title": "Differentially Private Reward Estimation with Preference Feedback",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Learning from preference-based feedback has recently gained considerable traction as a promising approach to align generative models with human interests. Instead of relying on numerical rewards, the generative models are trained using reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF). These approaches first solicit feedback from human labelers typically in the form of pairwise comparisons between two possible actions, then estimate a reward model using these comparisons, and finally employ a policy based on the estimated reward model. An adversarial attack in any step of the above pipeline might reveal private and sensitive information of human labelers. In this work, we adopt the notion of \\emph{label differential privacy} (DP) and focus on the problem of reward estimation from preference-based feedback while protecting privacy of each individual labelers. Specifically, we consider the parametric Bradley-Terry-Luce (BTL) model for such pairwise comparison feedback involving a latent reward parameter $\\theta^* \\in \\mathbb{R}^d$. Within a standard minimax estimation framework, we provide tight upper and lower bounds on the error in estimating $\\theta^*$ under both \\emph{local} and \\emph{central} models of DP. We show, for a given privacy budget $\\epsilon$ and number of samples $n$, that the additional cost to ensure label-DP under local model is $\\Theta \\big(\\frac{1}{ e^\\epsilon-1}\\sqrt{\\frac{d}{n}}\\big)$, while it is $\\Theta\\big(\\frac{\\sqrt{d}}{\\epsilon n} \\big)$ under the weaker central model. We perform simulations on synthetic data that corroborate these theoretical results",

    "title": "Differentiable Rendering with Reparameterized Volume Sampling",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "In view synthesis, a neural radiance field approximates underlying density and radiance fields based on a sparse set of scene pictures. To generate a pixel of a novel view, it marches a ray through the pixel and computes a weighted sum of radiance emitted from a dense set of ray points. This rendering algorithm is fully differentiable and facilitates gradient-based optimization of the fields. However, in practice, only a tiny opaque portion of the ray contributes most of the radiance to the sum. We propose a simple end-to-end differentiable sampling algorithm based on inverse transform sampling. It generates samples according to the probability distribution induced by the density field and picks non-transparent points on the ray. We utilize the algorithm in two ways. First, we propose a novel rendering approach based on Monte Carlo estimates. This approach allows for evaluating and optimizing a neural radiance field with just a few radiance field calls per ray. Second, we use the sampling algorithm to modify the hierarchical scheme proposed in the original NeRF work. We show that our modification improves reconstruction quality of hierarchical models, at the same time simplifying the training procedure by removing the need for auxiliary proposal network losses",

    "title": "Parameter-Agnostic Optimization under Relaxed Smoothness",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Tuning hyperparameters, such as the stepsize, presents a major challenge of training machine learning models. To address this challenge, numerous adaptive optimization algorithms have been developed that achieve near-optimal complexities, even when stepsizes are independent of problem-specific parameters, provided that the loss function is $L$-smooth. However, as the assumption is relaxed to the more realistic $(L_0, L_1)$-smoothness, all existing convergence results still necessitate tuning of the stepsize. In this study, we demonstrate that Normalized Stochastic Gradient Descent with Momentum (NSGD-M) can achieve a (nearly) rate-optimal complexity without prior knowledge of any problem parameter, though this comes at the cost of introducing an exponential term dependent on $L_1$ in the complexity. We further establish that this exponential term is inevitable to such schemes by introducing a theoretical framework of lower bounds tailored explicitly for parameter-agnostic algorithms. Interestingly, in deterministic settings, the exponential factor can be neutralized by employing Gradient Descent with a Backtracking Line Search. To the best of our knowledge, these findings represent the first parameter-agnostic convergence results under the generalized smoothness condition. Our empirical experiments further confirm our theoretical insights",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "The Conditional Gradient (or Frank-Wolfe) method is one of the most well-known methods for solving constrained optimization problems appearing in various machine learning tasks. The simplicity of iteration and applicability to many practical problems helped the method to gain popularity in the community. In recent years, the Frank-Wolfe algorithm received many different extensions, including stochastic modifications with variance reduction and coordinate sampling for training of huge models or distributed variants for big data problems. In this paper, we present a unified convergence analysis of the Stochastic Frank-Wolfe method that covers a large number of particular practical cases that may have completely different nature of stochasticity, intuitions and application areas. Our analysis is based on a key parametric assumption on the variance of the stochastic gradients. But unlike most works on unified analysis of other methods, such as SGD, we do not assume an unbiasedness of the real gradient estimation. We conduct analysis for convex and non-convex problems due to the popularity of both cases in machine learning. With this general theoretical framework, we not only cover rates of many known methods, but also develop numerous new methods. This shows the flexibility of our approach in developing new algorithms based on the Conditional Gradient approach. We also demonstrate the properties of the new methods through numerical experiments",

Existing approaches for tackling non-exchangeability lead to methods that are not computable beyond the simplest examples. In this work, we introduce a new efficient approach to CP that produces provably valid confidence sets for fairly general non-exchangeable data distributions. We illustrate the general theory with applications to the challenging setting of federated learning under data heterogeneity between agents. Our method allows constructing provably valid personalized prediction sets for agents in a fully federated way.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Likelihood-free inference methods based on neural conditional density estimation were shown to drastically reduce the simulation burden in comparison to classical methods such as ABC. When applied in the context of any latent variable model, such as a Hidden Markov model (HMM), these methods are designed to only estimate the parameters, rather than the joint distribution of the parameters and the hidden states. Naive application of these methods to a HMM, ignoring the inference of this joint posterior distribution, will thus produce an inaccurate estimate of the posterior predictive distribution, in turn hampering the assessment of goodness-of-fit. To rectify this problem, we propose a novel, sample-efficient likelihood-free method for estimating the high-dimensional hidden states of an implicit HMM. Our approach relies on learning directly the intractable posterior distribution of the hidden states, using an autoregressive-flow, by exploiting the Markov property. Upon evaluating our approach on some implicit HMMs, we found that the quality of the estimates retrieved using our method is comparable to what can be achieved using a much more computationally expensive SMC algorithm",

We show that the mechanism changes of observed variables can reveal which variable sets are confounded. Based on this idea, we propose an empirically testable criterion based on mutual information, show under which conditions it can identify confounding, and introduce CoCo to discover confounders from data in multiple contexts.

Moreover, tight and complete approaches for the verification of standard NNs, such as those based on Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP), cannot be directly used for the verification of BNNs because of the polynomial terms resulting from the consecutive multiplication of variables encoding the weights. Our algorithms efficiently and effectively search the parameters' space for safe weights by using iterative expansion and the network's gradient and can be used with any verification algorithm of choice for BNNs. In addition to proving that our algorithms compute tighter bounds than the SoA, we also evaluate our algorithms against the SoA on standard benchmarks, such as MNIST and CIFAR10, showing that our algorithms compute bounds up to 40% tighter than the SoA",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we address the problem of testing exchangeability of a sequence of random variables, $X_1, X_2,\\cdots$. This problem has been studied under the recently popular framework of \\emph{testing by betting}. But the mapping of testing problems to game is not one to one: many games can be designed for the same test. Past work established that it is futile to play single game betting on every observation: test martingales in the data filtration are powerless. Two avenues have been explored to circumvent this impossibility: betting in a reduced filtration (wealth is a test martingale in a coarsened filtration), or playing many games in parallel (wealth is an e-process in the data filtration). The former has proved to be difficult to theoretically analyze, while the latter only works for binary or discrete observation spaces. Here, we introduce a different approach that circumvents both drawbacks. We design a new (yet simple) game in which we observe the data sequence in pairs. Even though betting on individual observations is futile, we show that betting on pairs of observations is not. To elaborate, we prove that our game leads to a nontrivial test martingale, which is interesting because it has been obtained by shrinking the filtration very slightly. We show that our test controls type-1 error despite continuous monitoring, and is consistent for both binary and continuous observations, under a broad class of alternatives. Due to the shrunk filtration, optional stopping is only allowed at even stopping times: a relatively minor price. We provide a variety of simulations that align with our theoretical findings",
