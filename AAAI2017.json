    "title": "Multiple Source Detection without Knowing the Underlying Propagation Model",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Information source detection, which is the reverse problem of information diffusion, has attracted considerable research effort recently. Most existing approaches assume that the underlying propagation model is fixed and given as input, which may limit their application range. In this paper, we study the multiple source detection problem when the underlying propagation model is unknown. Our basic idea is source prominence, namely the nodes surrounded by larger proportions of infected nodes are more likely to be infection sources. As such, we propose a multiple source detection method called Label Propagation based Source Identification (LPSI). Our method lets infection status iteratively propagate in the network as labels, and finally uses local peaks of the label propagation result as source nodes. In addition, both the convergent and iterative versions of LPSI are given. Extensive experiments are conducted on several real-world datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method",

    "title": "CLARE: A Joint Approach to Label Classification and Tag Recommendation",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Data classification and tag recommendation are both important and challenging tasks in social media. These two tasks are often considered independently and most efforts have been made to tackle them separately. However, labels in data classification and tags in tag recommendation are inherently related. For example, a Youtube video annotated with NCAA, stadium, pac12 is likely to be labeled as football, while a video/image with the class label of coast is likely to be tagged with beach, sea, water and sand. The existence of relations between labels and tags motivates us to jointly perform classification and tag recommendation for social media data in this paper. In particular, we provide a principled way to capture the relations between labels and tags, and propose a novel framework CLARE, which fuses data CLAssification and tag REcommendation into a coherent model. With experiments on three social media datasets, we demonstrate that the proposed framework CLARE achieves superior performance on both tasks compared to the state-of-the-art methods",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "One fundamental problem in causal inference is the treatment effect estimation in observational studies when variables are confounded. Control for confounding effect is generally handled by propensity score. But it treats all observed variables as confounders and ignores the adjustment variables, which have no influence on treatment but are predictive of the outcome. Recently, it has been demonstrated that the adjustment variables are effective in reducing the variance of the estimated treatment effect. However, how to automatically separate the confounders and adjustment variables in observational studies is still an open problem, especially in the scenarios of high dimensional variables, which are common in big data era. In this paper, we propose a Data-Driven Variable Decomposition (D$^2$VD) algorithm, which can 1) automatically separate confounders and adjustment variables with a data driven approach, and 2) simultaneously estimate treatment effect in observational studies with high dimensional variables. Under standard assumptions, we show experimentally that the proposed D$^2$VD algorithm can automatically separate the variables precisely, and estimate treatment effect more accurately and with tighter confidence intervals than the state-of-the-art methods on both synthetic data and real online advertising dataset",

A popular model to measure social network engagement is k-core, the maximal induced subgraph in which every vertex has at least k neighbors. To identify critical users for social network engagement, we propose the collapsed k-core problem: given a graph G, a positive integer k and a budget b, we aim to find b vertices in G such that the deletion of the b vertices leads to the smallest k-core. We prove the problem is NP-hard. Then, an efficient algorithm is proposed, which significantly reduces the number of candidate vertices to speed up the computation.

The resulting inference problem is proved to be convex and is solved in parallel by using the barrier method.

While most existing works assign a single dominant emotion to each image, we address the sentiment ambiguity by label distribution learning (LDL), which is motivated by the fact that image usually evokes multiple emotions. Two new algorithms are developed based on conditional probability neural network (CPNN). First, we proposed BCPNN which encodes image label into a binary representation to replace the signless integers used in CPNN, and employ it as a part of input for the neural network. Then, we train our ACPNN model by adding noises to ground truth label and augmenting affective distributions. Since current datasets are mostly annotated for single-label learning, we build two new datasets, one of which is relabeled on the popular Flickr dataset and the other is collected from Twitter. These datasets contain 20,745 images with multiple affective labels, which are over ten times larger than the existing ones. Experimental results show that the proposed methods outperform the state-of-the-art works on our large-scale datasets and other publicly available benchmarks",

    "abstract": "Many real-world networks have a rich collection of objects. The semantics of these objects allows us to capture different classes of proximities, thus enabling an important task of semantic proximity search. As the core of semantic proximity search, we have to measure the proximity on a heterogeneous graph, whose nodes are various types of objects. Most of the existing methods rely on engineering features about the graph structure between two nodes to measure their proximity. With recent development on graph embedding, we see a good chance to avoid feature engineering for semantic proximity search. There is very little work on using graph embedding for semantic proximity search. We also observe that graph embedding methods typically focus on embedding nodes, which is an \"indirect'' approach to learn the proximity. Thus, we introduce a new concept of proximity embedding, which directly embeds the network structure between two possibly distant nodes. We also design our proximity embedding, so as to flexibly support both symmetric and asymmetric proximities. Based on the proximity embedding, we can easily estimate the proximity score between two nodes and enable search on the graph. We evaluate our proximity embedding method on three real-world public data sets, and show it outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines",

Cross-modal hashing enables efficient retrieval of one modality from database relevant to a query of another modality. Existing work on cross-modal hashing assumes that heterogeneous relationship across modalities is available for learning to hash. This paper relaxes this strict assumption by only requiring heterogeneous relationship in some auxiliary dataset different from the query or database domain. We design a novel hybrid deep architecture, transitive hashing network (THN), to jointly learn cross-modal correlation from the auxiliary dataset, and align the data distributions of the auxiliary dataset with that of the query or database domain, which generates compact transitive hash codes for efficient cross-modal retrieval.

    "abstract": "Network embedding, aiming to learn the low-dimensional representations of nodes in networks, is of paramount importance in many real applications. One basic requirement of network embedding is to preserve the structure and inherent properties of the networks. While previous network embedding methods primarily preserve the microscopic structure, such as the first- and second-order proximities of nodes, the mesoscopic community structure, which is one of the most prominent feature of networks, is largely ignored. In this paper, we propose a novel Modularized Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (M-NMF) model to incorporate the community structure into network embedding. We exploit the consensus relationship between the representations of nodes and community structure, and then jointly optimize NMF based representation learning model and modularity based community detection model in a unified framework, which enables the learned representations of nodes to preserve both of the microscopic and community structures. We also provide efficient updating rules to infer the parameters of our model, together with the correctness and convergence guarantees.

We considered the problem of identifying network communities and module semantics at the same time. We introduced a novel generative model with two closely correlated parts, one for communities and the other for semantics. We developed a co-learning strategy to jointly train the two parts of the model by combining a nested EM algorithm and belief propagation. By extracting the latent correlation between the two parts, our new method is not only robust for finding communities and semantics, but also able to provide more than one semantic explanation to a community.

To ensure reliable and efficient semantic discovery, we adopt non-parametric density estimation to re-rank the related visual instances and proposed a fast self-similarity-based quality assessment method to identify the high-quality semantic fragments. The discovered semantic fragments provide an adaptive joint representation for texts and images, based on which lingual-visual similarity can be defined for further co-analysis of heterogeneous multimedia data.

Our model further considers two types of semantically rich feature relationships in horizontal dimension, i.e. complementary and alternative relationships.

Much of the effort on Web data research has been focused on coping with incompleteness and uncertainty. Comparatively, dealing with context has received less attention, although it is crucial in judging the validity of a claim. For instance, what holds true in a US state, might not in its neighbors, e.g., due to obsolete or superseded laws. In this work, we address the problem of checking the validity of claims in multiple contexts. We define a language to represent and query facts across different dimensions.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Speech interaction systems have been gaining popularity in recent years. The main purpose of these systems is to generate more satisfactory responses according to users' speech utterances, in which the most critical problem is to analyze user intention. Researches show that user intention conveyed through speech is not only expressed by content, but also closely related with users' speaking manners (e.g. with or without acoustic emphasis). How to incorporate these heterogeneous attributes to infer user intention remains an open problem. In this paper, we define Intention Prominence (IP) as the semantic combination of focus by text and emphasis by speech, and propose a multi-task deep learning framework to predict IP. Specifically, we first use long short-term memory (LSTM) which is capable of modeling long short-term contextual dependencies to detect focus and emphasis, and incorporate the tasks for focus and emphasis detection with multi-task learning (MTL) to reinforce the performance of each other. We then employ Bayesian network (BN) to incorporate multimodal features (focus, emphasis, and location reflecting users' dialect conventions) to predict IP based on feature correlations. Experiments on a data set of 135,566 utterances collected from real-world Sogou Voice Assistant illustrate that our method can outperform the comparison methods over 6.9-24.5% in terms of F1-measure. Moreover, a real practice in the Sogou Voice Assistant indicates that our method can improve the performance on user intention understanding by 7%",

In the guaranteed delivery scenario, ad exposures (which are also called impressions in some works) to users are guaranteed by contracts signed in advance between advertisers and publishers. A crucial problem for the advertising platform is how to fully utilize the valuable user traffic to generate as much as possible revenue. Different from previous works which usually minimize the penalty of unsatisfied contracts and some other cost (e.g. representativeness), we propose the novel consumption minimization model, in which the primary objective is to minimize the user traffic consumed to satisfy all contracts. Under this model, we develop a near optimal method to deliver ads for users. The main advantage of our method lies in that it consumes nearly as least as possible user traffic to satisfy all contracts, therefore more contracts can be accepted to produce more revenue. It also enables the publishers to estimate how much user traffic is redundant or short so that they can sell or buy this part of traffic in bulk in the exchange market. Furthermore, it is robust with regard to priori knowledge of user type distribution. Finally, the simulation shows that our method outperforms the traditional state-of-the-art methods",

    "title": "Marrying Uncertainty and Time in Knowledge Graphs",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "The management of uncertainty is crucial when harvesting structured content from unstructured and noisy sources. Knowledge Graphs ( KGs ) are a prominent example. KGs maintain both numerical and non-numerical facts, with the support of an underlying schema. These facts are usually accompanied by a confidence score that witnesses how likely is for them to hold. Despite their popularity, most of existing KGs focus on static data thus impeding the availabilityof timewise knowledge. What is missing is a comprehensive solution for the management of uncertain and temporal data in KGs . The goal of this paper is to fill this gap. We rely on two main ingredients. The first is a numerical extension of Markov Logic Networks (MLNs) that provide the necessary underpinning to formalize the syntax and semantics of uncertain temporal KGs . The second is a set of Datalog constraints with inequalities that extend the underlying schema of the KGs and help to detect inconsistencies. From a theoretical point of view, we discuss the complexity of two important classes of queries for uncertain temporal KGs: maximuma-posteriori and conditional probability inference. Due to the hardness of these problems and the fact that MLN solvers do not scale well, we also explore the usage of Probabilistic Soft Logics (PSL) as a practical tool to support our reasoning tasks. We report on an experimental evaluation comparing the MLN and PSL approaches",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Everything has its time, which is also true in the point-of-interest (POI) recommendation task. A truly intelligent recommender system, even if you don't visit any sites or remain silent, should draw hints of your next destination from the ``silence\", and revise its recommendations as needed. In this paper, we construct a well-timed POI recommender system that updates its recommendations in accordance with the silence, the temporal period in which no visits are made. To achieve this, we propose a novel probabilistic model to predict the joint probabilities of the user visiting POIs and their time-points, by using the admixture or mixed-membership structure to extend marked point processes. With the admixture structure, the proposed model obtains a low dimensional representation for each user, leading to robust recommendation against sparse observations. We also develop an efficient and easy-to-implement estimation algorithm for the proposed model based on collapsed Gibbs and slice sampling. We apply the proposed model to synthetic and real-world check-in data, and show that it performs well in the well-timed recommendation task",

Inference of personal wellness-related attributes, such as body mass index or diseases tendency, as well as understanding of global dependencies between wellness attributes and users' behavior is of crucial importance to various applications in personal and public wellness domains. Meanwhile, the emergence of social media platforms and wearable sensors makes it feasible to perform wellness profiling for users from multiple perspectives. However, research efforts on wellness profiling and integration of social media and sensor data are relatively sparse, and this study represents one of the first attempts in this direction. Specifically, to infer personal wellness attributes, we proposed multi-source individual user profile learning framework named \"TweetFit\". \"TweetFit\" can handle data incompleteness and perform wellness attributes inference from sensor and social media data simultaneously. Our experimental results show that the integration of the data from sensors and multiple social media sources can substantially boost the wellness profiling performance",

In contrast, we consider a new research problem of predicting users who will visit a given POI in a given future period. The challenge of the problem lies in the difficulty to effectively learn POI sequential transition and user preference, and integrate them for prediction. In this work, we propose a new latent representation model POI2Vec that is able to incorporate the geographical influence, which has been shown to be very important in modeling user mobility behavior. Note that existing representation models fail to incorporate the geographical influence. We further propose a method to jointly model the user preference and POI sequential transition influence for predicting potential visitors for a given POI.

It tries to understand the high-level content of visual data. The success of current models can be attributed to the development of robust algorithms from computer vision. Most of the existing models try to solve the problem by proposing either robust features or more complex models. In particular, visual features from the whole image or video are the main proposed inputs. Little attention has been paid to local areas, which we believe is pretty relevant to human's emotional response to the whole image. In this work, we study the impact of local image regions on visual sentiment analysis. Our proposed model utilizes the recent studied attention mechanism to jointly discover the relevant local regions and build a sentiment classifier on top of these local regions. The experimental results suggest that 1) our model is capable of automatically discovering sentimental local regions of given images and 2) it outperforms existing state-of-the-art algorithms to visual sentiment analysis",

In this paper, we propose expectile matrix factorization by introducing asymmetric least squares, a key concept in expectile regression analysis, into the matrix factorization framework. We propose an efficient algorithm to solve the new problem based on alternating minimization and quadratic programming. We prove that our algorithm converges to a global optimum and exactly recovers the true underlying low-rank matrices when noise is zero.

    "abstract": "For quite some time, the analysis of leukocyte images has drawn significant attention from the fields of medicine and computer vision alike where various techniques have been used to automate the manual analysis and classification of such images. Analysing such samples manually for detecting leukocytes is time-consuming and prone to error as the cells have different morphological features. Therefore, in order to automate and optimize the process, the nature-inspired Plant Growth Simulation Algorithm (PGSA) has been applied in this paper. An automated detection technique of white blood cells embedded in obscured, stained and smeared images of blood samples has been presented in this paper which is based on a random bionic algorithm and makes use of a fitness function that measures the similarity of the generated candidate solution to an actual leukocyte. As the proposed algorithm proceeds the set of candidate solutions evolves, guaranteeing their fit with the actual leukocytes outlined in the edge map of the image. The experimental results of the stained images and the empirical results reported validate the higher precision and sensitivity of the proposed method than the existing methods. Further, the proposed method reduces the feasible sets of candidate points in each iteration, thereby decreasing the required run time of load flow, objective function evaluation, thus reaching the goal state in minimum time and within the desired constraints",

    "abstract": "In this paper we present a novel geometric method for the problem of global pairwise alignment of protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks. A PPI network can be viewed as a node-edge graph and its alignment often needs to solve some generalized version of the subgraph isomorphism problem which is notoriously challenging and NP-hard. All existing research has focused on designing algorithms with good practical performance. In this paper we propose a two-step algorithm for the global pairwise PPI network alignment which consists of a Geometric Step and an MCMF Step. Our algorithm first applies a graph embedding technique that preserves the topological structure of the original PPI networks and maps the problem from graph domain to geometric domain, and computes a rigid transformation for one of the embedded PPI networks so as to minimize its Earth Mover's Distance (EMD) to the other PPI network. It then solves a Min-Cost Max-Flow problem using the (scaled) inverse of sequence similarity scores as edge weight. By using the flow values from the two steps (i.e., EMD and Min-Cost Max-Flow) as the matching scores, we are able to combine the two matching results to obtain the desired alignment. Unlike other popular alignment algorithms which are either greedy or incremental, our algorithm globally optimizes the problem to yield an alignment with better quality",

We then derive instantiations of these networks that are 'rational by design' in terms of naturally encoding a valid call option surface that enforces no arbitrage principles.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Multivariate Pattern (MVP) classification can map different cognitive states to the brain tasks. One of the main challenges in MVP analysis is validating the generated results across subjects. However, analyzing multi-subject fMRI data requires accurate functional alignments between neuronal activities of different subjects, which can rapidly increase the performance and robustness of the final results. Hyperalignment (HA) is one of the most effective functional alignment methods, which can be mathematically formulated by the Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) methods. Since HA mostly uses the unsupervised CCA techniques, its solution may not be optimized for MVP analysis. By incorporating the idea of Local Discriminant Analysis (LDA) into CCA, this paper proposes Local Discriminant Hyperalignment (LDHA) as a novel supervised HA method, which can provide better functional alignment for MVP analysis. Indeed, the locality is defined based on the stimuli categories in the train-set, where the correlation between all stimuli in the same category will be maximized and the correlation between distinct categories of stimuli approaches to near zero. Experimental studies on multi-subject MVP analysis confirm that the LDHA method achieves superior performance to other state-of-the-art HA algorithms",

We rigorously formulate the above idea as an optimization problem. We then show that the simple partitions which contain only one sample in each group are always better, and reduce finding the optimal simple partition to a well-studied Min-r-Partition problem. We adapt an approximation algorithm and a heuristic algorithm to solve the optimization problem. Moreover, to obtain opinion similarity efficiently, we adapt a well-known opinion evolution model to characterize social interactions, and provide an exact computation of opinion similarities based on the model. We use both synthetic and real-world datasets to demonstrate that the partitioned sampling method results in significant improvement in sampling quality and it is robust when some opinion similarities are inaccurate or even missing",

It satisfies all the desired properties (being parameter-free, comprehensive and scalable) by leveraging a principled, multi-level, flexible framework which maps the problem to a path optimization problem over a weighted DAG.

    "abstract": "Automated prostate segmentation from 3D MR images is very challenging due to large variations of prostate shape and indistinct prostate boundaries. We propose a novel volumetric convolutional neural network (ConvNet) with mixed residual connections to cope with this challenging problem. Compared with previous methods, our volumetric ConvNet has two compelling advantages. First, it is implemented in a 3D manner and can fully exploit the 3D spatial contextual information of input data to perform efficient, precise and volume-to-volume prediction. Second and more important, the novel combination of residual connections (i.e., long and short) can greatly improve the training efficiency and discriminative capability of our network by enhancing the information propagation within the ConvNet both locally and globally. While the forward propagation of location information can improve the segmentation accuracy, the smooth backward propagation of gradient flow can accelerate the convergence speed and enhance the discrimination capability. Extensive experiments on the open MICCAI PROMISE12 challenge dataset corroborated the effectiveness of the proposed volumetric ConvNet with mixed residual connections. Our method ranked the first in the challenge, outperforming other competitors by a large margin with respect to most of evaluation metrics. The proposed volumetric ConvNet is general enough and can be easily extended to other medical image analysis tasks, especially ones with limited training data",

Active and qualified individuals may collaborate with each other in the form of teams to accomplish a set of tasks. Our goal is to find a grouping method that maximizes the total profit of the tasks that these teams can complete. Any feasible grouping must satisfy the following three conditions: (i) each team possesses all skills required by the task, (ii) individuals within the same team are social compatible, and (iii) each individual is not overloaded. We refer to this as the Team Grouping problem. Our work presents a detailed analysis of the computational complexity of the problem, and propose a LP-based approximation algorithm to tackle it and its variants. Although we focus on team grouping in this paper, our results apply to a broad range of optimization problems that can be formulated as a cover decomposition problem",

    "abstract": "The Team-maxmin equilibrium prescribes the optimal strategies for a team of rational players sharing the same goal and without the capability of correlating their strategies in strategic games against an adversary. This solution concept can capture situations in which an agent controls multiple resources - corresponding to the team members - that cannot communicate. It is known that such equilibrium always exists and it is unique (except degenerate cases) and these properties make it a credible solution concept to be used in real-world applications, especially in security scenarios. Nevertheless, to the best of our knowledge, the Team-maxmin equilibrium is almost completely unexplored in the literature. In this paper, we investigate bounds of (in)efficiency of the Team-maxmin equilibrium w.r.t. the Nash equilibria and w.r.t. the Maxmin equilibrium when the team members can play correlated strategies. Furthermore, we study a number of algorithms to find and/or approximate an equilibrium, discussing their theoretical guarantees and evaluating their performance by using a standard testbed of game instances",

    "title": "The Computational Complexity of Weighted Greedy Matching",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Motivated by the fact that in several cases a matching in a graph is stable if and only if it is produced by a greedy algorithm, we study the problem of computing a maximum weight greedy matching on weighted graphs, termed GREEDYMATCHING. In wide contrast to the maximum weight matching problem, for which many efficient algorithms are known, we prove that GREEDYMATCHING is strongly NP-hard and APX-complete, and thus it does not admit a PTAS unless P=NP, even on graphs with maximum degree at most 3 and with at most three different integer edge weights. Furthermore we prove that GREEDYMATCHING is strongly NP-hard if the input graph is in addition bipartite. Moreover we consider three natural parameters of the problem, for which we establish a sharp threshold behavior between NP-hardness and computational tractability. On the positive side, we present a randomized approximation algorithm (RGMA) for GREEDYMATCHING on a special class of weighted graphs, called bushgraphs. We highlight an unexpected connection between RGMA and the approximation of maximum cardinality matching in unweighted graphs via randomized greedy algorithms. We show that, if the approximation ratio of RGMA is ρ, then for every ε > 0 the randomized MRG algorithm of (Aronson et al. 1995) gives a (ρ − ε)-approximation for the maximum cardinality matching. We conjecture that a tightbound for ρ is 2/3; we prove our conjecture true for four subclasses of bush graphs. Proving a tight bound for the approximation ratio of MRG on unweighted graphs (and thus also proving a tight value for ρ) is a long-standing open problem (Poloczek and Szegedy 2012). This unexpected relation of our RGMA algorithm with the MRG algorithm may provide new insights for solving this problem",

In SIP, the agents have friends, enemies, and preferences on the number of attendees at the event; an agent is willing to attend the event if all friends of the agent attend, no enemy of the agent attends, and the number of attendees is acceptable to the agent. We consider two solution concepts: (1) individual rationality (everyone who is invited is willing to attend) and (2) (Nash) stability (no agent wants to deviate from the given invitation).It is known that finding an invitation of given size for either concept is NP-complete. In this work, we study the complexity of SIP on a finer scale, through the lense of parameterized complexity.For the two solution concepts and the special cases where the number of friends and/or enemies is bounded above by a constant, we show that the problems belong to different complexity classes when parameterized by the size of solutions.For instance finding an individually rational invitation of size k is W[1]-complete, yet finding a stable invitation is W[2]-complete.Moreover, when all friend and enemy relations are symmetric, finding a solution of either of the concepts becomes fixed-parameter tractable unless agents have unbounded number(s) of enemies",

The traditional models in game theory and multiagent system research, such as finite automata or unrestricted Turing machine, fall short of capturing how intelligent agents make decision in realistic applications. To address this problem, we model bounded rational agents as restricted Turing machines: restrictions on running time and on storage space. We study our model under the context of two-person repeated games. In the case where the running time of Turing machines is restricted, we show that computing the best response of a given strategy is much harder than the strategy itself. In the case where the storage space of the Turing machines is restricted, we show the best response of a space restricted strategy can not be implemented by machines within the same size (up to a constant factor). Finally, we study how these restrictions affect the set of Nash equilibria in infinitely repeated games.We show restricting the agent's computational resources will give rise to new Nash equilibria",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "The Man-In-The-Middle (MITM) attack is one of the most common attacks employed in the network hacking. MITM attackers can successfully invoke attacks such as denial of service (DoS) and port stealing, and lead to surprisingly harmful consequences for users in terms of both financial loss and security issues. The conventional defense approaches mainly consider how to detect and eliminate those attacks or how to prevent those attacks from being launched in the first place. This paper proposes a game-theoretic defense strategy from a different perspective, which aims at minimizing the loss that the whole system sustains given that the MITM attacks are inevitable. We model the interaction between the attacker and the defender as a Stackelberg security game and adopt the Strong Stackelberg Equilibrium (SSE) as the defender's strategy. Since the defender's strategy space is infinite in our model, we employ a novel method to reduce the searching space of computing the optimal defense strategy. Finally, we empirically evaluate our optimal defense strategy by comparing it with non-strategic defense strategies. The results indicate that our game-theoretic defense strategy significantly outperforms other non-strategic defense strategies in terms of decreasing the total losses against MITM attacks",

However, little is known about the computational complexity of these problems, especially when there exist dependencies among the targets. Moreover, previous security game models do not in general scale well. In this paper, we investigate a general security game where the utility function is defined on a collection of subsets of all targets, and provide a novel theoretical framework to show how to compactly represent such a game, efficiently compute the optimal (minimax) strategies, and characterize the complexity of this problem. We apply our theoretical framework to the network security game. We characterize settings under which we find a polynomial time algorithm for computing optimal strategies.

We follow this idea and propose a game-based model of cohesion that not only relies on the social network, but also reflects individuals' social needs. In particular, our model is a type of cooperative games where players may gain popularity by strategically forming groups. A group is socially cohesive if the grand coalition is core stable. We study social cohesion in some special types of graphs and draw a link between social cohesion and a classical notion of structural cohesion by White and Harary. We then focus on the problem of deciding whether a given social network is socially cohesive and show that this problem is CoNP-complete. Nevertheless, we give two efficient heuristics for coalition structures where players enjoy high popularity and experimentally evaluate their performances",

However, this problem has not been solved well in existing work for the following two reasons. (i) Some of them cannot cover the Ellsberg paradox and the Machina Paradox. Thus, the choices that they predict could be inconsistent with empirical observations. (ii) Some of them rely on parameter tuning without offering explanations for the reasonability of setting such bounds of parameters. Thus, the prediction of such a model in new decision making problems is doubtful. To the end, this paper proposes a new decision making model based on D-S theory and the emotion of ambiguity aversion. Some insightful properties of our model and the validating on two famous paradoxes show that our model indeed is a better alternative for decision making under ambiguity",

This equilibrium concept refines the Nash equilibrium requiring resilience with respect to a specific vanishing perturbation, representing mistakes of the players at each decision node. The scientific challenge is intrinsic to the EFPE definition: it requires a perturbation over the agent form, but the agent form is computationally inefficient due to the presence of highly nonlinear constraints. We show that the sequence form can be exploited in a non-trivial way and that, for general-sum games, finding an EFPE is equivalent to solving a suitably perturbed linear complementarity problem. We prove that Lemke's algorithm can be applied, showing that computing an EFPE is PPAD-complete. In the notable case of zero-sum games, the problem is in FP and can be solved by linear programming. Our algorithms also allow one to find a Nash equilibrium when players cannot perfectly control their moves, being subject to a given execution uncertainty, as is the case in most realistic physical settings",

    "abstract": "Consider a situation with n agents or players, where some of the players form a coalition with a certain collective objective. Simple games are used to model systems that can decide whether coalitions are successful (winning) or not (losing). A simple game can be viewed as a monotone boolean function. The dimension of a simple game is the smallest positive integer d such that the simple game can be expressed as the intersection of d threshold functions, where each threshold function uses a threshold and n weights. Taylor and Zwicker have shown that d is bounded from above by the number of maximal losing coalitions. We present two new upper bounds both containing the Taylor-Zwicker bound as a special case. The Taylor-Zwicker bound implies an upper bound of (n choose n/2). We improve this upper bound significantly by showing constructively that d is bounded from above by the cardinality of any binary covering code with length n and covering radius 1. This result supplements a recent result where Olsen et al. showed how to construct simple games with dimension |C| for any binary constant weight SECDED code C with length n.

    "abstract": "Much recent work in the AI community concerns algorithms for computing optimal mixed strategies to commit to, as well as the deployment of such algorithms in real security applications. Another possibility is to commit not to play certain actions. If only one player makes such a commitment, then this is generally less powerful than completely committing to a single mixed strategy. However, if players can alternatingly commit not to play certain actions and thereby iteratively reduce their strategy spaces, then desirable outcomes can be obtained that would not have been possible with just a single player committing to a mixed strategy. We refer to such a setting as a disarmament game. In this paper, we study disarmament for two-player normal-form games. We show that deciding whether an outcome can be obtained with disarmament is NP-complete (even for a fixed number of rounds), if only pure strategies can be removed. On the other hand, for the case where mixed strategies can be removed, we provide a folk theorem that shows that all desirable utility profiles can be obtained, and give an efficient algorithm for (approximately) obtaining them",

The optimal pricing problem seeks a price of each item and an assignment of items to buyers such that every buyer achieves the maximum utility under the prices. The goal of the problem is to maximize the total payment from buyers. In this paper, we consider the case that the valuations are submodular. We show that the problem is computationally hard even if there exists only one buyer. Then we propose approximation algorithms for the unlimited budget case.

We deal with a generic problem that can model both the prisoner's dilemma and the team production problem. We examine a situation with an additional action that is dominated by another action. To our surprise, by adding this seemingly irrelevant action, players can achieve sustainable cooperative relations far beyond the ideal situations. More specifically, we identify a class of strategies called one-shot punishment strategy that can constitute a belief-free equilibrium in a wide range of parameters. Moreover, for a two-player case, the obtained welfare matches a theoretical upper bound",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we analyze an emerging economic form, called fans economy, in which a fan donates money to the host and gets allocated proportional to the amount of his donation (normalized by the overall amount of donation). Fans economy is the major way live streaming apps monetize and includes a number of popular economic forms ranging from crowdfunding to mutual fund. We propose an auction game, coined all-pay auctions with proportional allocation (APAPA), to model the fans economy and analyze the auction from the perspective of revenue. Comparing to the standard all-pay auction, which normally has no pure Nash-Equilibrium in the complete information setting, we solve the pure Nash-Equilibrium of the APAPA in closed form and prove its uniqueness. Motivated by practical concerns, we then analyze the case where APAPA is equipped with a reserve and show that there might be multiple equilibria in this case. We give an efficient algorithm to compute all equilibria in this case. For either case, with or without reserve, we show that APAPA always extracts revenue that 2-approximates the second-highest valuation. Furthermore, we conduct experiments to show how revenue changes with respect to different reserves",

Each agent's utility equals the total value of her items included in the knapsack. We wish to maximize social welfare, and attempt to design mechanisms that lead to small worst-case approximation ratios at equilibrium. We provide a randomized mechanism with attractive strategic properties: it has a price of anarchy of 2 for Bayes-Nash and coarse correlated equilibria. For overstating-only agents, it becomes strategyproof, and has a matching lower bound. For the case of two understating-only agents, we provide a specialized randomized strategyproof 1.522-approximate mechanism, and a lower bound of 1.09. When all agents but one are honest, we provide a deterministic strategyproof 1.618-approximate mechanism with a matching lower bound.

The method improves the best-known upper bound with respect to the number of players n, and it is the first implemented algorithm, to our knowledge, that manages to solve all instances. The main components of our tree-search-based method are a node-selection strategy, an exclusion oracle, and a subdivision scheme. The node-selection strategy determines the next region (of the strategy profile probability vector space) to be explored — based on the region's size and an estimate of whether the region contains an equilibrium. The exclusion oracle provides a provably correct sufficient condition for there not to exist an equilibrium in the region. The subdivision scheme determines how the region is split if it cannot be excluded. Unlike the well-known incomplete methods, our method does not need to proceed locally, which avoids it getting stuck in a local minimum---in the space of players' regrets — that may be far from any actual equilibrium. The run time grows rapidly with the game size; this reflects the dimensionality of this difficult problem. That suggests a hybrid scheme where one of the relatively fast prior incomplete algorithms is run, and if it fails to find an equilibrium, then our method is used",

In view of these non-existence and complexity results, we present a polynomial-time 2-approximation algorithm for MmS fairness for chores. We then introduce a new fairness concept called optimal MmS that represents the best possible allocation in terms of MmS that is guaranteed to exist.

Among the apparently infinite such rules, what is the best one to use? To answer this question, we assume that we have partial access to an underlying true ranking. Then, the important optimization problem to be solved is to compute the positional scoring rule whose outcome, when applied to the profile of individual rankings, is as close as possible to the part of the underlying true ranking we know. We study this fundamental problem from a theoretical point of view and present positive and negative complexity results.

We show that the problem is NP-complete for one manipulating agent with additive utilities and several non-manipulating agents. In doing so, we correct a wrong claim made in a previous paper. We then give two additional results. First, we present a polynomial-time algorithm for optimal manipulation when the manipulator has additive binary utilities. Second, we consider a stronger notion of manipulation whereby the untruthful outcome yields more utility than the truthful outcome for all utilities consistent with the ordinal preferences; for this notion, we show that a manipulation, if any, can be computed in polynomial time",

We here deepen the study of the limitations of OSP mechanisms by looking at their approximation guarantees for basic optimization problems paradigmatic of the area, i.e., machine scheduling and facility location. We prove a number of bounds on the approximation guarantee of OSP mechanisms, which show that OSP can come at a significant cost. However, rather surprisingly, we prove that OSP mechanisms can return optimal solutions when they use monitoring — a novel mechanism design paradigm that introduces a mild level of scrutiny on agents' declarations (Kovacs, Meyer, and Ventre 2015)",

We are especially interested in situations where teams can form coalitions. We provide an efficient algorithm that, given a coalition, finds an optimal way for each team in a coalition to improve its pay-off. In contrast, we show that deciding whether such a coalition exists is NP-hard.

In forecast aggregation, for example, it is known that using weighted averages, where more weight is put on more accurate forecasters, outperforms simple averaging of forecasts. We introduce proxy scoring rules, which generalize proper scoring rules and, given access to an appropriate proxy, allow for immediate scoring of probabilistic forecasts. In particular, we suggest a proxy-scoring generalization of the popular quadratic scoring rule, and characterize its incentive and accuracy evaluation properties theoretically. Moreover, we thoroughly evaluate it experimentally using data from a large real world geopolitical forecasting tournament, and show that it is competitive with proper scoring rules when the number of questions is small",

    "abstract": "We consider voting under metric preferences: both voters and candidates are associated with points in a metric space, and each voter prefers candidates that are closer to her to ones that are further away. In this setting, it is often desirable to select a candidate that minimizes the sum of distances to the voters. However, common voting rules operate on voters' preference rankings and therefore may be unable to identify the best candidate. A relevant measure of the quality of a voting rule is then its distortion, defined as the worst-case ratio between the performance of a candidate selected by the rule and that of an optimal candidate. Anshelevich, Bhardwaj and Postl show that some popular rules such as Borda and Plurality do badly in this regard: their distortion scales linearly with the number of candidates. On the positive side, Anshelevich et al. identify a few voting rules whose distortion is bounded by a constant; however, these rules are rarely used in practice. In this paper, we analyze the distortion of two widely used (classes of) voting rules, namely, scoring rules and Single Transferable Vote (STV). We show that all scoring rules have super-constant distortion, answering a question that was left open by Anshelevich et al.; however, we identify a scoring rule whose distortion is asymptotically better than that of Plurality and Borda. For STV, we obtain an upper bound of O(log m), where m is the number of candidates, as well as a super-constant lower bound; thus, STV is a reasonable, though not a perfect rule from this perspective",

This growth results in more lives saved, but exacerbates the empirical hardness of the NP-complete problem of optimally matching patients to donors. State-of-the-art matching engines use integer programming techniques to clear fielded kidney exchanges, but these methods must be tailored to specific models and objective functions, and may fail to scale to larger exchanges. In this paper, we observe that if the kidney exchange compatibility graph can be encoded by a constant number of patient and donor attributes, the clearing problem is solvable in polynomial time. We give necessary and sufficient conditions for losslessly shrinking the representation of an arbitrary compatibility graph. Then, using real compatibility graphs from the UNOS US-wide kidney exchange, we show how many attributes are needed to encode real graphs.

But can these stable matchings be computed efficiently, as in the one-to-one matching case? The algorithm of (Hatfield and Milgrom 2005) requires efficient implementation of a choice function over substitutable preferences. We show that even given efficient access to a value oracle or preference relation satisfying substitutability, exponentially many queries may be required in the worst case to implement a choice function. Indeed, this extends to examples where a stable matching requires exponential time to compute. We characterize the computational complexity of stable matchings by showing that efficient computation of a choice function is equivalent to efficient verification—determining whether or not, for a given set, the most preferred subset is the entire set itself. Clearly, verification is necessary for computation, but we show that it is also sufficient: specifically, given a verifier, we design a polynomial-time algorithm for computing a choice function, implying an efficient algorithm for stable matching. We then show that a verifier can be implemented efficiently for various classes of functions, such as submodular functions, implying efficient stable matching algorithms for a broad range of settings. We also investigate the effect of ties in the preference order, which causes complications both in defining substitutes and in computation. In this case, we tightly connect the computational complexity of the choice function to a measure on the number of ties",

In this paper, we consider a more flexible pricing model for instance reservation, in which a customer can propose the time length and number of resources of her request, while in today's industry, customers can only choose from several predefined reservation packages. Under this model, we design randomized mechanisms for customers coming online to optimize social welfare and providers' revenue. We first consider a simple case, where the requests from the customers do not vary too much in terms of both length and value density. We design a randomized mechanism that achieves a competitive ratio 1/42 for both social welfare and revenue, which is a improvement as there is usually no revenue guarantee in previous works such as (Azar et al. 2015; Wang et al. 2015. This ratio can be improved up to 1/11 when we impose a realistic constraint on the maximum number of resources used by each request. On the hardness side, we show an upper bound 1/3 on competitive ratio for any randomized mechanism.We then extend our mechanism to the general case and achieve a competitive ratio 1/42⌈log k⌉ log T for both social welfare and revenue, where T is the ratio of the maximum request length to the minimum request length and k is the ratio of the maximum request value density to the minimum request value density. This result outperforms the previous upper bound 1/CkT for deterministic mechanisms (Wang et al. 2015). We also prove an upper bound 2/log 8kT for any randomized mechanism. All the mechanisms we provide are in a greedy style. They are truthful and easy to be integrated into practical cloud systems",

In sharp contrast to classical housing markets, previous studies in multi-type housing markets have been hindered by the lack of natural solution concepts, because the strict core might be empty. We break the barrier in the literature by leveraging AI techniques and making natural assumptions on agents' preferences. We show that when agents' preferences are lexicographic, even with different importance orders, the classical top-trading-cycles mechanism can be extended while preserving most of its nice properties. We also investigate computational complexity of checking whether an allocation is in the strict core and checking whether the strict core is empty.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Regret minimization is widely used in determining strategies for imperfect-information games and in online learning. In large games, computing the regrets associated with a single iteration can be slow. For this reason, pruning — in which parts of the decision tree are not traversed in every iteration — has emerged as an essential method for speeding up iterations in large games. The ability to prune is a primary reason why the Counterfactual Regret Minimization (CFR) algorithm using regret matching has emerged as the most popular iterative algorithm for imperfect-information games, despite its relatively poor convergence bound. In this paper, we introduce dynamic thresholding, in which a threshold is set at every iteration such that any action in the decision tree with probability below the threshold is set to zero probability. This enables pruning for the first time in a wide range of algorithms. We prove that dynamic thresholding can be applied to Hedge while increasing its convergence bound by only a constant factor in terms of number of iterations. Experiments demonstrate a substantial improvement in performance for Hedge as well as the excessive gap technique",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Reserve price is an effective tool for revenue maximization in ad auctions. The optimal reserve price depends on bidders' value distributions, which, however, are generally unknown to auctioneers. A common practice for auctioneers is to first collect information about the value distributions by a sampling procedure and then apply the reserve price estimated with the sampled bids to the following auctions. In order to maximize the total revenue over finite auctions, it is important for the auctioneer to find a proper sample size to trade off between the cost of the sampling procedure and the optimality of the estimated reserve price. We investigate the sample size optimization problem for Generalized Second Price auctions, which is the most widely-used mechanism in ad auctions, and make three main contributions along this line. First, we bound the revenue losses in the form of competitive ratio during and after sampling. Second, we formulate the problem of finding the optimal sample size as a non-convex mixed integer optimization problem. Then we characterize the properties of the problem and prove the uniqueness of the optimal sample size. Third, we relax the integer optimization problem to a continuous form and develop an efficient algorithm based on the properties to solve it. Experimental results show that our approach can significantly improve the revenue for the auctioneer in finitely repeated ad auctions",

    "abstract": "This paper studies an auction design problem for a seller to sell a commodity in a social network, where each individual (the seller or a buyer) can only communicate with her neighbors. The challenge to the seller is to design a mechanism to incentivize the buyers, who are aware of the auction, to further propagate the information to their neighbors so that more buyers will participate in the auction and hence, the seller will be able to make a higher revenue. We propose a novel auction mechanism, called information diffusion mechanism (IDM), which incentivizes the buyers to not only truthfully report their valuations on the commodity to the seller, but also further propagate the auction information to all their neighbors. In comparison, the direct extension of the well-known Vickrey-Clarke-Groves (VCG) mechanism in social networks can also incentivize the information diffusion, but it will decrease the seller's revenue or even lead to a deficit sometimes. The formalization of the problem has not yet been addressed in the literature of mechanism design and our solution is very significant in the presence of large-scale online social networks",

In particular, they are stable under the deviation of the grand coalition, as they do not permit a simultaneous deviation by all the agents making all of them weakly better off and some strictly better off. We first show that, while computing a Pareto stable solution maximizing the social welfare is NP-hard in bounded degree graphs, a 2 min{Delta,sqrt n}-approximating one can be determined in polynomial time, where n is the number of agents and Delta the maximum node degree. We then determine asymptotically tight bounds on the Price of Pareto Optimality for several classes of social graphs arising from the following combinations: unbounded and bounded node degree, undirected and directed edges, unweighted and weighted edges",

This paper analyzes the problem in the context of auctions (specifically for second-price auctions). It provides an equilibrium analysis to the case where the information provider can use signaling according to some pre-committed scheme before introducing its regular (costly) information selling offering. The signal provided, publicly discloses (for free) some of the information held by the information provider. Providing the signaling is thus somehow counter intuitive as the information provider ultimately attempts to maximize her gain from selling the information she holds. Still, we show that such signaling capability can be highly beneficial for the information provider and even improve social welfare. Furthermore, the examples provided demonstrate various possible other beneficial behaviors available to the different players as well as to a market designer, such as paying the information provider to leave the system or commit to a specific signaling scheme. Finally, the paper provides an extension of the underlying model, related to the use of mixed signaling strategies",

    "abstract": "The goal of multi-winner elections is to choose a fixed-size committee based on voters' preferences. An important concern in this setting is representation: large groups of voters with cohesive preferences should be adequately represented by the election winners. Recently, Aziz et al. proposed two axioms that aim to capture this idea: justified representation (JR) and its strengthening extended justified representation (EJR). In this paper, we extend the work of Aziz et al. in several directions. First, we answer an open question of Aziz et al., by showing that Reweighted Approval Voting satisfies JR for k = 3; 4; 5, but fails it for k >= 6. Second, we observe that EJR is incompatible with the Perfect Representation criterion, which is important for many applications of multi-winner voting, and propose a relaxation of EJR, which we call Proportional Justified Representation (PJR). PJR is more demanding than JR, but, unlike EJR, it is compatible with perfect representation, and a committee that provides PJR can be computed in polynomial time if the committee size divides the number of voters. Moreover, just like EJR, PJR can be used to characterize the classic PAV rule in the class of weighted PAV rules. On the other hand, we show that EJR provides stronger guarantees with respect to average voter satisfaction than PJR does",

    "abstract": "Most existing models of Stackelberg security games ignore the underlying topology of the space in which targets and defence resources are located. As a result, allocation of resources is restricted to a discrete collection of exogenously defined targets. However, in many practical security settings, defense resources can be located on a continuous plane. Better defense solutions could therefore be potentially achieved by placing resources in a space outside of actual targets (e.g., between targets). To address this limitation, we propose a model called Security Game on a Plane (SGP) in which targets are distributed on a 2-dimensional plane, and security resources, to be allocated on the same plane, protect targets within a certain effective distance. We investigate the algorithmic aspects of SGP. We find that computing a strong Stackelberg equilibrium of an SGP is NP-hard even for zero-sum games, and these are inapproximable in general. On the positive side, we find an exact solution technique for general SGPs based on an existing approach, and develop a PTAS (polynomial-time approximation scheme) for zero-sum SGP to more fundamentally overcome the computational obstacle. Our experiments demonstrate the value of considering SGP and effectiveness of our algorithms",

    "abstract": "Euclidean preferences are a widely studied preference model, in which decision makers and alternatives are embedded in d-dimensional Euclidean space. Decision makers prefer those alternatives closer to them. This model, also known as multidimensional unfolding, has applications in economics, psychometrics, marketing, and many other fields. We study the problem of deciding whether a given preference profile is d-Euclidean. For the one-dimensional case, polynomial-time algorithms are known. We show that, in contrast, for every other fixed dimension d > 1, the recognition problem is equivalent to the existential theory of the reals (ETR), and so in particular NP-hard. We further show that some Euclidean preference profiles require exponentially many bits in order to specify any Euclidean embedding, and prove that the domain of d-Euclidean preferences does not admit a finite forbidden minor characterisation for any d > 1. We also study dichotomous preferences and the behaviour of other metrics, and survey a variety of related work",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "In many real-world systems, strategic agents' decisions can be understood as complex - i.e., consisting of multiple sub-decisions - and hence can give rise to an exponential number of pure strategies. Examples include network congestion games, simultaneous auctions, and security games. However, agents' sets of strategies are often structured, allowing them to be represented compactly. There currently exists no general modeling language that captures a wide range of commonly seen strategy structure and utility structure. We propose Resource Graph Games (RGGs), the first general compact representation for games with structured strategy spaces, which is able to represent a wide range of games studied in literature. We leverage recent results about multilinearity, a key property of games that allows us to represent the mixed strategies compactly, and, as a result, to compute various equilibrium concepts efficiently. While not all RGGs are multilinear, we provide a general method of converting RGGs to those that are multilinear, and identify subclasses of RGGs whose converted version allow efficient computation",

    "abstract": "Peer prediction mechanisms are often adopted to elicit truthful contributions from crowd workers when no ground-truth verification is available. Recently, mechanisms of this type have been developed to incentivize effort exertion, in addition to truthful elicitation. In this paper, we study a sequential peer prediction problem where a data requester wants to dynamically determine the reward level to optimize the trade-off between the quality of information elicited from workers and the total expected payment. In this problem, workers have homogeneous expertise and heterogeneous cost for exerting effort, both unknown to the requester. We propose a sequential posted-price mechanism to dynamically learn the optimal reward level from workers' contributions and to incentivize effort exertion and truthful reporting. We show that (1) in our mechanism, workers exerting effort according to a non-degenerate threshold policy and then reporting truthfully is an equilibrium that returns highest utility for every worker, and (2) The regret of our learning mechanism w.r.t. offering the optimal reward (price) is upper bounded by Õ(T{3/4) where T is the learning horizon. We further show the power of our learning approach when the reports of workers do not necessarily follow the game-theoretic equilibrium",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "In the Colonel Blotto game, which was initially introduced by Borel in 1921, two colonels simultaneously distribute their troops across different battleﬁelds.The winner of each battleﬁeld is determined independently by a winner-take-all rule. The ultimate payoff of each colonel is the number of battleﬁelds he wins. This game is commonly used for analyzing a wide range of applications such as the U.S presidential election, innovative technology competitions, advertisements, etc. There have been persistent efforts for ﬁnding the optimal strategies for the Colonel Blotto game. After almost a century Ahmadinejad, Dehghani, Hajiaghayi, Lucier, Mahini, and Seddighin provided a poly-time algorithm for ﬁnding the optimal strategies. They ﬁrst model the problem by a Linear Program (LP) with exponential number of constraints and use Ellipsoid method to solve it. However, despite the theoretical importance of their algorithm, it ishighly impractical. In general, even Simplex method (despite its exponential running-time) performs better than Ellipsoid method in practice. In this paper, we provide the ﬁrst polynomial-size LP formulation of the optimal strategies for the Colonel Blotto game. We use linear extension techniques. Roughly speaking, we project the strategy space polytope to a higher dimensional space, which results in a lower number of facets for the polytope.We use this polynomial-size LP to provide a novel, simpler and signiﬁcantly faster algorithm for ﬁnding the optimal strategies for the Colonel Blotto game. We further show this representation is asymptotically tight in terms of the number of constraints. We also extend our approach to multi-dimensional Colonel Blotto games, and implement our algorithm to observe interesting properties of Colonel Blotto; for example, we observe the behavior of players in the discrete model is very similar to the previously studied continuous model",

Most prior work considered networks that are symmetric and homogeneous (e.g., vertex transitive). In this paper we consider asymmetric or heterogeneous settings that complement the current literature: 1) we show that increasing asymmetry in network topology can improve convergence rates. The star graph empirically converges faster than all previously studied graphs; 2) we consider graph topologies that are particularly challenging for naming game such as disjoint cliques or multi-level trees and ask how much extra homogeneity (random edges) is required to allow convergence or fast convergence. We provided theoretical analysis which was confirmed by simulations; 3) we analyze how consensus can be manipulated when stubborn nodes are introduced at different points of the process. Early introduction of stubborn nodes can easily influence the outcome in certain family of networks while late introduction of stubborn nodes has much less power",

It is important that algorithms become more time and space efficient as the size of datasets increase. An algorithm that runs in polynomial time may not have a reasonable running time for such large datasets. Here, we study the development of pricing algorithms that are appropriate for use with massive datasets. We especially focus on the streaming setting, the common model for big data analysis. We present an envy-free mechanism for social welfare maximization problem in the streaming setting using O(k2l) space, where k is the number of different goods and l is the number of available items of each good. We also provide an α-approximation mechanism for revenue maximization in this setting given an α-approximation mechanism for the corresponding offline problem exists. Moreover, we provide mechanisms to approximate the optimum social welfare (or revenue) within 1 – ε factor, in space independent of l which would be favorable in case l is large compared to k. Finally, we present hardness results showing approximation of optimal prices that maximize social welfare (or revenue) in the streaming setting needs Ω(l) space. We achieve our results by developing a powerful sampling technique for bipartite networks. The simplicity of our sampling technique empowers us to maintain the sample over the input sequence. Indeed, one can construct this sample in the distributed setting (a.k.a, MapReduce) and get the same results in two rounds of computations, or one may simply apply this sampling technique to provide faster offline algorithms",

    "abstract": "A well-known problem in combinatorial auctions (CAs) is that the value space grows exponentially in the number of goods, which often puts a large burden on the bidders and on the auctioneer. In this paper, we introduce a new design paradigm for CAs based on machine learning (ML). Bidders report their values (bids) to a proxy agent by answering a small number of value queries. The proxy agent then uses an ML algorithm to generalize from those bids to the whole value space, and the efficient allocation is computed based on the generalized valuations. We introduce the concept of \"probably approximate efficiency (PAE)\" to measure the efficiency of the new ML-based auctions, and we formally show how the generelizability of an ML algorithm relates to the efficiency loss incurred by the corresponding ML-based auction. To instantiate our paradigm, we use support vector regression (SVR) as our ML algorithm, which enables us to keep the winner determination problem of the CA tractable. Different parameters of the SVR algorithm allow us to trade off the expressiveness, economic efficiency, and computational efficiency of the CA. Finally, we demonstrate experimentally that, even with a small number of bids, our ML-based auctions are highly efficient with high probability",

However, we still lack a thorough understanding of which structural restrictions make these problems tractable. Here we focus on structure captured via so-called decompositional parameters, which have been highly successful in fields such as boolean satisfiability and constraint satisfaction but have not yet reached their full potential in the ILP setting. In particular, primal treewidth (an established decompositional parameter) can only be algorithmically exploited to solve ILP under restricted circumstances. Our main contribution is the introduction and algorithmic exploitation of two new decompositional parameters for ILP and MILP. The first, torso-width, is specifically tailored to the linear programming setting and is the first decompositional parameter which can also be used for MILP. The latter, incidence treewidth, is a concept which originates from boolean satisfiability but has not yet been used in the ILP setting; here we obtain a full complexity landscape mapping the precise conditions under which incidence treewidth can be used to obtain efficient algorithms. Both of these parameters overcome previous shortcomings of primal treewidth for ILP in unique ways, and consequently push the frontiers of tractability for these important problems",

However, while specific restart strategies have been developed for specific problems (and specific algorithms), restarts are typically not regarded as a general tool to speed up an optimization algorithm. In fact, many optimization algorithms do not employ restarts at all. Recently, \"bet-and-run\" was introduced in the context of mixed-integer programming, where first a number of short runs with randomized initial conditions is made, and then the most promising run of these is continued. In this article, we consider two classical NP-complete combinatorial optimization problems, traveling salesperson and minimum vertex cover, and study the effectiveness of different bet-and-run strategies. In particular, our restart strategies do not take any problem knowledge into account, nor are tailored to the optimization algorithm. Therefore, they can be used off-the-shelf. We observe that state-of-the-art solvers for these problems can benefit significantly from restarts on standard benchmark instances",

In this paper, we show that for any p, p1, and p2 > 0 satisfying 1/p = 1/p1 + 1/p2, there is an equivalence between the Schatten-p norm of one matrix and the Schatten-p1 and the Schatten-p2 norms of its two factor matrices. We further extend the equivalence to multiple factor matrices and show that all the factor norms can be convex and smooth for any p > 0. In contrast, the original Schatten-p norm for 0 < p < 1 is non-convex and non-smooth. As an example we conduct experiments on matrix completion. To utilize the convexity of the factor matrix norms, we adopt the accelerated proximal alternating linearized minimization algorithm and establish its sequence convergence.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Automatically searching for optimal hyperparameter configurations is of crucial importance for applying deep learning algorithms in practice. Recently, Bayesian optimization has been proposed for optimizing hyperparameters of various machine learning algorithms. Those methods adopt probabilistic surrogate models like Gaussian processes to approximate and minimize the validation error function of hyperparameter values. However, probabilistic surrogates require accurate estimates of sufficient statistics (e.g., covariance) of the error distribution and thus need many function evaluations with a sizeable number of hyperparameters. This makes them inefficient for optimizing hyperparameters of deep learning algorithms, which are highly expensive to evaluate. In this work, we propose a new deterministic and efficient hyperparameter optimization method that employs radial basis functions as error surrogates. The proposed mixed integer algorithm, called HORD, searches the surrogate for the most promising hyperparameter values through dynamic coordinate search and requires many fewer function evaluations. HORD does well in low dimensions but it is exceptionally better in higher dimensions. Extensive evaluations on MNIST and CIFAR-10 for four deep neural networks demonstrate HORD significantly outperforms the well-established Bayesian optimization methods such as GP, SMAC, and TPE. For instance, on average, HORD is more than 6 times faster than GP-EI in obtaining the best configuration of 19 hyperparameters",

By utilizing the low-rank structure of the intermediate solutions and stochastic gradients, the complexity of our algorithm has a linear dependence on the dimensionality d. The key idea is to maintain all the iterates in factorized representations and construct stochastic gradients that are low-rank.

This paper proposes the EmbeddedHunter algorithm, which incorporates the technique in a hierarchical stochastic bandit setting, following the optimism in the face of uncertainty principle and breaking away from the multiple-run framework in which random embedding has been conventionally applied similar to stochastic black-box optimization solvers. Our proposition is motivated by the bounded mean variation in the objective value for a low-dimensional point projected randomly into the decision space of Lipschitz-continuous problems. In essence, the EmbeddedHunter algorithm expands optimistically a partitioning tree over a low-dimensional — equal to the effective dimension of the problem —search space based on a bounded number of random embeddings of sampled points from the low-dimensional space. In contrast to the probabilistic theoretical guarantees of multiple-run random-embedding algorithms, the finite-time analysis of the proposed algorithm presents a theoretical upper bound on the regret as a function of the algorithm's number of iterations. Furthermore, numerical experiments were conducted to validate its performance. The results show a clear performance gain over recently proposed random embedding methods for large-scale problems, provided the intrinsic dimensionality is low",

    "abstract": "Nowadays, asynchronous parallel algorithms have received much attention in the optimization field due to the crucial demands for modern large-scale optimization problems. However, most asynchronous algorithms focus on convex problems. Analysis on nonconvex problems is lacking. For the Asynchronous Stochastic Descent (ASGD) algorithm, the best result from (Lian et al., 2015) can only achieve an asymptotic O(\\frac{1}{\\epsilon^2}) rate (convergence to the stationary points) on nonconvex problems. In this paper, we study Stochastic Variance Reduced Gradient (SVRG) in the asynchronous setting. We propose the Asynchronous Stochastic Variance Reduced Gradient (ASVRG) algorithm for nonconvex finite-sum problems. We develop two schemes for ASVRG, depending on whether the parameters are updated as an atom or not. We prove that both of the two schemes can achieve linear speed up (a non-asymptotic O(\\frac{n^\\frac{2}{3}}{\\epsilon}) rate to the stationary points) for nonconvex problems when the delay parameter \\tau\\leq n^{\\frac{1}{3}}, where n is the number of training samples. We also establish a non-asymptotic O(\\frac{n^\\frac{2}{3}\\tau^\\frac{1}{3}}{\\epsilon}) rate (convergence to the stationary points) for our algorithm without assumptions on \\tau. This further demonstrates that even with asynchronous updating, SVRG has less number of Incremental First-order Oracles (IFOs) compared with Stochastic Gradient Descent and Gradient Descent. We also experiment on a shared memory multi-core system to demonstrate the efficiency of our algorithm",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Submodular function maximization has numerous applications in machine learning and artificial intelligence. Many real applications require multiple submodular objective func-tions to be maximized, and which function is regarded as important by a user is not known in advance. In such cases, it is desirable to have a small family of representative solutions that would satisfy any user's preference. A traditional approach for solving such a problem is to enumerate the Pareto optimal solutions. However, owing to the massive number of Pareto optimal solutions (possibly exponentially many), it is difficult for a user to select a solution. In this paper, we propose two efficient methods for finding a small family of representative solutions, based on the notion of regret ratio. The first method outputs a family of fixed size with a nontrivial regret ratio. The second method enables us to choose the size of the output family, and in the biobjective case, it has a provable trade-off between the size and the regret ratio. Using real and synthetic data, we empirically demonstrate that our methods achieve a small regret ratio",

Maximizing non-monotone DR-submodular functions has many applications in machine learning that cannot be captured by submodular set functions. In this paper, we present a 1/(2+ε)-approximation algorithm with a running time of roughly O(n/ε log2B), where n is the size of the ground set, B is the maximum value of a coordinate, and ε > 0 is a parameter. The approximation ratio is almost tight and the dependency of running time on B is exponentially smaller than the naive greedy algorithm. Experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our algorithm outputs almost the best solution compared to other baseline algorithms, whereas its running time is several orders of magnitude faster",

We propose an automated approach that accepts an arbitrary MiniZinc model and solves it using LBBD with no additional intervention on the part of the modeller. The design of this approach also reveals an interesting duality between LBBD and large neighborhood search (LNS).

Hence much research resorts to k-plex — a graph in which any vertex is adjacent to all but at most k vertices — which is a relaxation model of the clique. In this paper, we study the maximum k-plex problem and propose a fast algorithm to compute maximum k-plexes by exploiting structural properties of the problem. In an n-vertex graph, the algorithm computes optimal solutions in cnnO(1) time for a constant c < 2 depending only on k. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first algorithm that breaks the trivial theoretical bound of 2n for each k ≥ 3.

To avoid tedious and often highly sub-optimal manual tuning of such parameters by means of ad-hoc methods, general-purpose algorithm configuration procedures can be used to automatically find performance-optimizing parameter settings. While impressive performance gains are often achieved in this manner, additional, potentially costly parameter importance analysis is required to gain insights into what parameter changes are most responsible for those improvements. Here, we show how the running time cost of ablation analysis, a well-known general-purpose approach for assessing parameter importance, can be reduced substantially by using regression models of algorithm performance constructed from data collected during the configuration process. In our experiments, we demonstrate speed-up factors between 33 and 14 727 for ablation analysis on various configuration scenarios from AI planning, SAT, ASP and mixed integer programming (MIP)",

Phase transitions in the solubility of random problem instances have proved useful in the study of problem difficulty for other classes of computational problems, notably SAT and CSP, and it has been shown that the hardest problems typically occur during this rapid transition. In this work, we perform the first empirical investigation of the phase transition phenomena for heuristic search. We establish the existence of a rapid transition in the solubility of an abstract model of heuristic search problems and show that, for greedy best first search, the hardest instances are associated with the phase transition region. We then perform a novel investigation of the behavior of heuristics of different strength across the solubility spectrum. Finally, we demonstrate that the behavior of our abstract model carries over to commonly used benchmark problems including the Pancake Problem, Grid Navigation, TopSpin, and the Towers of Hanoi.

First, we describe an algorithm running in ∆O(k) ⋅ n time for searching the k-swap neighborhood on n-vertex graphs with maximum degree ∆.

Finally, we show that it is worthwhile to consider moderately-sized k-swap neighborhoods. For our benchmark data set, we show that when combining our algorithm with a hill-climbing approach, the solution quality improves quickly with the radius k of the local search neighborhood and that in most cases optimal solutions can be found by setting k=21",

On the contrary, much effort is spent in the literature to develop upper and lower bounds for MSCP. In this paper, we borrow a notion called motif, that was used in a recent work for upper bounding the minimum number of colors in an optimal solution of MSCP, to develop a new algebraic lower bound called for MSCP.

An MO algorithm needs to find solutions that reach different optimal balances of the objective functions, i.e., optimal Pareto front, therefore, high dimensionality of the solution space can hurt MO optimization much severer than single-objective optimization, which was little addressed in previous studies. This paper proposes a general, theoretically-grounded yet simple approach ReMO, which can scale current derivative-free MO algorithms to the high-dimensional non-convex MO functions with low effective dimensions, using random embedding. We prove the conditions under which an MO function has a low effective dimension, and for such functions, we prove that ReMO possesses the desirable properties of optimal Pareto front preservation, time complexity reduction, and rotation perturbation invariance. Experimental results indicate that ReMO is effective for optimizing the high-dimensional MO functions with low effective dimensions, and is even effective for the high-dimensional MO functions where all dimensions are effective but most only have a small and bounded effect on the function value",

A surprising fact about the vast literature on this problem is that very limited neighborhoods have been studied. Indeed, only the 4- and 8-neighborhoods are usually considered, and rarely the 16-neighborhood. This paper describes three contributions that enable the construction of effective grid path planners for extended 2k-neighborhoods. First, we provide a simple recursive definition of the 2k-neighborhood in terms of the 2k–1-neighborhood. Second, we derive distance functions, for any k >1, which allow us to propose admissible heurisitics which are perfect for obstacle-free grids. Third, we describe a canonical ordering which allows us to implement a version of A* whose performance scales well when increasing k. Our empirical evaluation shows that the heuristics we propose are superior to the Euclidean distance (ED) when regular A* is used. For grids beyond 64 the overhead of computing the heuristic yields decreased time performance compared to the ED. We found also that a configuration of our A*-based implementation, without canonical orders, is competitive with the \"any-angle\" path planner Theta$^*$ both in terms of solution quality and runtime",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "This paper studies the benefit for information providers in free public information disclosure in settings where the prospective information buyers are people. The underlying model, which applies to numerous real-life situations, considers a standard decision making setting where the decision maker is uncertain about the outcomes of her decision. The information provider can fully disambiguate this uncertainty and wish to maximize her profit from selling such information. We use a series of AMT-based experiments with people to test the benefit for the information provider from reducing some of the uncertainty associated with the decision maker's problem, for free. Free information disclosure of this kind can be proved to be ineffective when the buyer is a fully-rational agent. Yet, when it comes to people we manage to demonstrate that a substantial improvement in the information provider's profit can be achieved with such an approach. The analysis of the results reveals that the primary reason for this phenomena is people's failure to consider the strategic nature of the interaction with the information provider. Peoples' inability to properly calculate the value of information is found to be secondary in its influence",

    "title": "JAG: A Crowdsourcing Framework for Joint Assessment and Peer Grading",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Generation and evaluation of crowdsourced content is commonly treated as two separate processes, performed at different times and by two distinct groups of people: content creators and content assessors. As a result, most crowdsourcing tasks follow this template: one group of workers generates content and another group of workers evaluates it. In an educational setting, for example, content creators are traditionally students that submit open-response answers to assignments (e.g., a short answer, a circuit diagram, or a formula) and content assessors are instructors that grade these submissions. Despite the considerable success of peer-grading in massive open online courses (MOOCs), the process of test-taking and grading are still treated as two distinct tasks which typically occur at different times, and require an additional overhead of grader training and incentivization. Inspired by this problem in the context of education, we propose a general crowdsourcing framework that fuses open-response test-taking (content generation) and assessment into a single, streamlined process that appears to students in the form of an explicit test, but where everyone also acts as an implicit grader. The advantages offered by our framework include: a common incentive mechanism for both the creation and evaluation of content, and a probabilistic model that jointly models the processes of contribution and evaluation, facilitating efficient estimation of the quality of the contributions and the competency of the contributors. We demonstrate the effectiveness and limits of our framework via simulations and a real-world user study",

    "abstract": "A common technique for improving the quality of crowdsourcing results is to assign a same task to multiple workers redundantly, and then to aggregate the results to obtain a higher-quality result; however, this technique is not applicable to complex tasks such as article writing since there is no obvious way to aggregate the results. Instead, we can use a two-stage procedure consisting of a creation stage and an evaluation stage, where we first ask workers to create artifacts, and then ask other workers to evaluate the artifacts to estimate their quality. In this study, we propose a novel quality estimation method for the two-stage procedure where pairwise comparison results for pairs of artifacts are collected at the evaluation stage. Our method is based on an extension of Kleinberg's HITS algorithm to pairwise comparison, which takes into account the ability of evaluators as well as the ability of creators. Experiments using actual crowdsourcing tasks show that our methods outperform baseline methods especially when the number of evaluators per artifact is small",

    "abstract": "Entity resolution (ER) is the task of identifying all records in a database that refer to the same underlying entity, and are therefore duplicates of each other. Due to inherent ambiguity of data representation and poor data quality, ER is a challenging task for any automated process. As a remedy, human-powered ER via crowdsourcing has become popular in recent years. Using crowd to answer queries is costly and time consuming. Furthermore, crowd-answers can often be faulty. Therefore, crowd-based ER methods aim to minimize human participation without sacrificing the quality and use a computer generated similarity matrix actively. While, some of these methods perform well in practice, no theoretical analysis exists for them, and further their worst case performances do not reflect the experimental findings. This creates a disparity in the understanding of the popular heuristics for this problem. In this paper, we make the first attempt to close this gap. We provide a thorough analysis of the prominent heuristic algorithms for crowd-based ER. We justify experimental observations with our analysis and information theoretic lower bounds",

There are countless short texts in online media like twitter, online Q&A sites and so on. Discovering topics is quite valuable in various application domains such as content recommendation and text characterization. Traditional topic models like LDA are widely applied for sorts of tasks, but when it comes to short text scenario, these models may get stuck due to the lack of words. Recently, a popular model named BTM uses word co-occurrence relationship to solve the sparsity problem and is proved effectively. However, both BTM and extended models ignore the inside relationship between words. From our perspectives, more related words should appear in the same topic. Based on this idea, we propose a model named RIBS-TM which makes use of RNN for relationship learning and IDF for filtering high-frequency words.

In thispaper we present an alternative approach based on inliningof external atoms, motivated by existing but less general approaches for specialized formalisms such as DL-programs.

Unlike previous work, we keep the most general functional model but make an assumption on the unobserved exogenous variable: Inspired by Occam's razor, we assume that the exogenous variable is simple in the true causal direction. We quantify simplicity using Renyi entropy. Our main result is that, under natural assumptions, if the exogenous variable has low H0 entropy (cardinality) in the true direction, it must have high H0 entropy in the wrong direction. We establish several algorithmic hardness results about estimating the minimum entropy exogenous variable. We show that the problem of finding the exogenous variable with minimum H1 entropy (Shannon Entropy) is equivalent to the problem of finding minimum joint entropy given n marginal distributions, also known as minimum entropy coupling problem. We propose an efficient greedy algorithm for the minimum entropy coupling problem, that for n=2 provably finds a local optimum. This gives a greedy algorithm for finding the exogenous variable with minimum Shannon entropy. Our greedy entropy-based causal inference algorithm has similar performance to the state of the art additive noise models in real datasets. One advantage of our approach is that we make no use of the values of random variables but only their distributions. Our method can therefore be used for causal inference for both ordinal and also categorical data, unlike additive noise models",

The first one eliminates cycles by extracting directed acyclic graphs, and the other one eliminates cycles by grouping nodes into different levels.

Although researchers continue to improve these models using an increasingly complex feature space, we show that simple changes in the architecture of the underlying model can outperform state-of-the-art models without the need for complex feature engineering. In this work, we present a shared variable neural network model called ProjE that fills-in missing information in a knowledge graph by learning joint embeddings of the knowledge graph's entities and edges, and through subtle, but important, changes to the standard loss function. In doing so, ProjE has a parameter size that is smaller than 11 out of 15 existing methods while performing 37% better than the current-best method on standard datasets.

In this paper, we extend OpenPDBs by Datalog+/- ontologies, under which both upper and lower probabilities of queries become even more informative, enabling us to distinguish queries that were indistinguishable before. We show that the dichotomy between P and PP in (Open)PDBs can be lifted to the case of first-order rewritable positive programs (without negative constraints); and that the problem can become NP^PP-complete, once negative constraints are allowed.

    "title": "Practical TBox Abduction Based on Justification Patterns",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "TBox abduction explains why an observation is not entailed by a TBox, by computing multiple sets of axioms, called explanations, such that each explanation does not entail the observation alone while appending an explanation to the TBox renders the observation entailed but does not introduce incoherence. Considering that practical explanations in TBox abduction are likely to mimic minimal explanations for TBox entailments, we introduce admissible explanations which are subsets of those justifications for the observation that are instantiated from a finite set of justification patterns. A justification pattern is obtained from a minimal set of axioms responsible for a certain atomic concept inclusion by replacing all concept (resp. role) names with concept (resp. role) variables. The number of admissible explanations is finite but can still be so large that computing all admissible explanations is impractical. Thus, we introduce a variant of subset-minimality, written ⊆ds-minimality, which prefers fresh (concept or role) names than existing names. We propose efficient methods for computing all admissible ⊆ds-minimal explanations and for computing all justification patterns, respectively. Experimental results demonstrate that combining the proposed methods is able to achieve a practical approach to TBox abduction",

    "abstract": "Knowledge graphs play a significant role in many intelligent systems such as semantic search and recommendation systems. Recent works in this area of knowledge graph embeddings such as TransE, TransH and TransR have shown extremely competitive and promising results in relational learning. In this paper, we propose a novel extension of the translational embedding model to solve three main problems of the current models. Firstly, translational models are highly sensitive to hyperparameters such as margin and learning rate. Secondly, the translation principle only allows one spot in vector space for each golden triplet. Thus, congestion of entities and relations in vector space may reduce precision. Lastly, the current models are not able to handle dynamic data especially the introduction of new unseen entities/relations or removal of triplets. In this paper, we propose Parallel Universe TransE (puTransE), an adaptable and robust adaptation of the translational model. Our approach non-parametrically estimates the energy score of a triplet from multiple embedding spaces of structurally and semantically aware triplet selection. Our proposed approach is simple, robust and parallelizable. Our experimental results show that our proposed approach outperforms TransE and many other embedding methods for link prediction on knowledge graphs on both public benchmark dataset and a real world dynamic dataset",

We present a translation of LPMLN into programs with weak constraints and a translation of P-log into LPMLN, which complement the existing translations in the opposite directions. The first translation allows us to compute the most probable stable models (i.e., MAP estimates) of LPMLN programs using standard ASP solvers. This result can be extended to other formalisms, such as Markov Logic, ProbLog, and Pearl's Causal Models, that are shown to be translatable into LPMLN. The second translation tells us how probabilistic nonmonotonicity (the ability of the reasoner to change his probabilistic model as a result of new information) of P-log can be represented in LPMLN, which yields a way to compute P-log using standard ASP solvers and MLN solvers",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Trivia is any fact about an entity which is interesting due to its unusualness, uniqueness or unexpectedness. Trivia could be successfully employed to promote user engagement in various product experiences featuring the given entity. A Knowledge Graph (KG) is a semantic network which encodes various facts about entities and their relationships. In this paper, we propose a novel approach called DBpedia Trivia Miner (DTM) to automatically mine trivia for entities of a given domain in KGs. The essence of DTM lies in learning an Interestingness Model (IM), for a given domain, from human annotated training data provided in the form of interesting facts from the KG. The IM thus learnt is applied to extract trivia for other entities of the same domain in the KG. We propose two different approaches for learning the IM - a) A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based approach and b) Fusion Based CNN (F-CNN) approach which combines both hand-crafted and CNN features. Experiments across two different domains - Bollywood Actors and Music Artists reveal that CNN automatically learns features which are relevant to the task and shows competitive performance relative to hand-crafted feature based baselines whereas F-CNN significantly improves the performance over the baseline approaches which use hand-crafted features alone. Overall, DTM achieves an F1 score of 0.81 and 0.65 in Bollywood Actors and Music Artists domains respectively",

    "abstract": "The need to extend business process languages with the capability to model complex data objects along with the control flow perspective has lead to significant practical and theoretical advances in the field of Business Process Modeling (BPM).On the practical side, there are several suites for control flow and data modeling; nonetheless, when it comes to formal verification, the data perspective is abstracted away due to the intrinsic difficulty of handling unbounded data. On the theoretical side, there is significant literature providing decidability results for expressive data-aware processes. However, they struggle to produce a concrete impact as being far from real BPM architectures and, most of all, not providing actual verification tools. In this paper we aim at bridging such a gap: we provide a concrete framework which, on the one hand, being based on Petri Nets and relational models, is close to the widely used BPM suites, and on the other is grounded on solid formal basis which allow to perform formal verification tasks. Moreover, we show how to encode our framework in an action language so as to perform reachability analysis using virtually any state-of-the-art planner",

Instead of restricting the ontology language we aim at a classification of the patterns of datatype atoms in OMQs into those that can occur in non-tractable OMQs and those that only occur in tractable OMQs. To this end we establish a close link between OMQ answering with datatypes and constraint satisfaction problems over the datatypes. In a case study we apply this link to prove a P/coNP-dichotomy for OMQs over DL-Lite extended with the datatype (Q,<=).

We define a notion of sound abstraction between such action theories in terms of the existence of a suitable bisimulation between their respective models. Sound abstractions have many useful properties that ensure that we can reason about the agent's actions (e.g., executability, projection, and planning) at the abstract level, and refine and concretely execute them at the low level.

Given a model of correct and faulty behaviors of a partially observable discrete event system, equipped with a set of elementary actions that do not intertwine with autonomous events, we search a diagnosability plan, i.e., a sequence of applicable actions that leads the system from an initial belief state (a set of potentially current states) to a diagnosable belief state, in which the system is then left to run freely. This helps in reducing the diagnosis interaction with running systems and can be applied, e.g., on the output of a repair plan, like in power networks. The two successive stages of this approach keep diagnosability planning, including diagnosability tests, in PSpace in comparison to the Exptime test for the more complex active diagnosability used usually in such cases. For this, we propose to construct incrementally the twin plant structure of the given system and to exploit its parts already constructed while testing the candidate plans and constructing its next parts. This helps in pruning the twin plant constructions and many non-diagnosability plan tests. We have created a special benchmark and tested three proposed methods, according to the recycling level of twin plants construction, with one cost function used for plan optimality and an optional heuristics",

Generally, by using CI tests, a set of Markov equivalence classes w.r.t. the observed data can be estimated by checking whether each pair of variables x and y is d-separated, given a set of variables Z. Due to the curse of dimensionality, CI testing is often difficult to return a reliable result for high-dimensional Z. In this paper, we propose a regression-based CI test to relax the test of x ⊥ y|Z to simpler unconditional independence tests of x − f(Z) ⊥ y−g(Z), and x−f(Z) ⊥ Z or y−g(Z) ⊥ Z under the assumption that the data-generating procedure follows additive noise models (ANMs). When the ANM is identifiable, we prove that x − f(Z) ⊥ y − g(Z) ⇒ x ⊥ y|Z. We also show that 1) f and g can be easily estimated by regression, 2) our test is more powerful than the state-of-the-art kernel CI tests, and 3) existing causal learning algorithms can infer much more causal directions by using the proposed method",

It can be seen as an assembly language for hard combinatorial problems ranging from classification and regression in learning, to computing optimal policies and equilibria in decision theory, to entropy minimization in information sciences. Unfortunately, specifying such problems in complex domains involving relations, objects and other logical dependencies is cumbersome at best, requiring considerable expert knowledge, and solvers require models to be painstakingly reduced to standard forms. To overcome this, we introduce a rich modeling framework for optimization problems that allows convenient codification of symbolic structure. Rather than reducing this symbolic structure to a sparse or dense matrix, we represent and exploit it directly using algebraic decision diagrams (ADDs). Combining efficient ADD-based matrix-vector algebra with a matrix-free interior-point method, we develop an engine that can fully leverage the structure of symbolic representations to solve convex linear and quadratic optimization problems. We demonstrate the flexibility of the resulting symbolic-numeric optimizer on decision making and compressed sensing tasks with millions of non-zero entries",

    "title": "An Improved Algorithm for Learning to Perform Exception-Tolerant Abduction",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Inference from an observed or hypothesized condition to a plausible cause or explanation for this condition is known as abduction. For many tasks, the acquisition of the necessary knowledge by machine learning has been widely found to be highly effective. However, the semantics of learned knowledge are weaker than the usual classical semantics, and this necessitates new formulations of many tasks. We focus on a recently introduced formulation of the abductive inference task that is thus adapted to the semantics of machine learning. A key problem is that we cannot expect that our causes or explanations will be perfect, and they must tolerate some error due to the world being more complicated than our formalization allows. This is a version of the qualification problem, and in machine learning, this is known as agnostic learning. In the work by Juba that introduced the task of learning to make abductive inferences, an algorithm is given for producing k-DNF explanations that tolerates such exceptions: if the best possible k-DNF explanation fails to justify the condition with probability ε, then the algorithm is promised to find a k-DNF explanation that fails to justify the condition with probability at most O(nkε), where n is the number of propositional attributes used to describe the domain. Here, we present an improved algorithm for this task. When the best k- DNF fails with probability ε, our algorithm finds a k-DNF that fails with probability at most O ̃(nk/2ε) (i.e., suppressing logarithmic factors in n and 1/ε). We also examine the empirical advantage of this new algorithm over the previous algorithm in two test domains, one of explaining conditions generated by a \"noisy\" k-DNF rule, and another of explaining conditions that are actually generated by a linear threshold rule",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Evolution of Knowledge Bases (KBs) consists of incorporating new information in an existing KB. Previous studies assume that the new information should be fully trusted and thus completely incorporated in the old knowledge. We suggest a setting where the new knowledge can be partially trusted and develop model-based approaches (MBAs) to KB evolution that rely on this assumption. Under MBAs the result of evolution is a set of interpretations and thus two core problems for MBAs are closure, i.e., whether evolution result can be axiomatised with a KB, and approximation, i.e., whether it can be (maximally) approximated with a KB. We show that DL-Lite is not closed under a wide range of trust-sensitive MBAs. We introduce a notion of s-approximation that improves the previously proposed approximations and show how to compute it for various trust-sensitive MBAs",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "A directed graph where there is exactly one edge between every pair of vertices is called a tournament. Finding the \"best\" set of vertices of a tournament is a well studied problem in social choice theory. A tournament solution takes a tournamentas input and outputs a subset of vertices of the input tournament. However, in many applications, for example, choosing the best set of drugs from a given set of drugs, the edges of the tournament are given only implicitly and knowing the orientation of an edge is costly. In such scenarios, we would like to know the best set of vertices (according to some tournament solution) by \"querying\" as few edges as possible. We, in this paper, precisely study this problem for commonly used tournament solutions: given an oracle access to the edges of a tournament T , find f(T) by querying as few edges as possible, for a tournament solution f. We first show that the set of Condorcet non-losers in a tournament can be found by querying 2n−⌊log n⌋−2 edges only and this is tight in the sense that every algorithm for finding the set of Condorcet non-losers needs to query at least 2n−⌊log n⌋−2 edges in the worst case, where n is the number of vertices in the input tournament. We then move on to study other popular tournament solutions and show that any algorithm for finding the Copeland set, the Slater set, the Markov set, the bipartisan set, the uncovered set, the Banks set, and the top cycle must query Ω(n2) edges in the worst case. On the positive side, we are able to circumvent our strong query complexity lower bound results by proving that, if the size of the top cycle of the input tournament is at most k, then we can find all the tournament solutions mentioned above by querying O(nk + n log n / log(1− 1 / k ) ) edges only",

However, for one of the most important natural voting systems, the Borda Count, only a few such complexity results are known. We reduce the number of missing cases by pinpointing the complexity of three control scenarios for Borda elections, including some that arguably are among the practically most relevant ones. We also study online candidate control, an interesting dynamical, partial-information model due to Hemaspaandra et al. (2012a), who mainly focused on general complexity bounds by constructing artificial voting systems—only recently they succeeded in classifying four problems of online candidate control for one natural voting system: sequential plurality (Hemaspaandra et al. 2016).

    "abstract": "Before engaging in a group venture agents may seek commitments from other members in the group and, based on the level of participation (i.e. the number of actually committed participants), decide whether it is worth joining the venture. Alternatively, agents can delegate this costly process to a (beneficent or non-costly) third-party, who helps seek commitments from the agents. Using methods from Evolutionary Game Theory, this paper shows that, in the context of Public Goods Game, much higher levels of cooperation can be achieved through such centralized commitment management. It provides a more efficient mechanism for dealing with commitment free-riders, those who are not willing to bear the cost of arranging commitments whilst enjoying the benefits provided by the paying commitment proposers. We show that the participation level plays a crucial role in the decision of whether an agreement should be formed; namely, it needs to be more strict in terms of the level of participation required from players of the centralized system for the agreement to be formed; however, once it is done right, it is much more beneficial in terms of the level of cooperation and social welfare achieved. In short, our analysis provides important insights for the design of multi-agent systems that rely on commitments to monitor agents' cooperative behavior",

The idea is that only those agents that meet the criteria get to benefit from the group effort, giving an incentive to contribute even when it is otherwise individually irrational. Specifically, the paper provides a comprehensive equilibrium analysis of a threshold-based criteria mechanism for the common cooperative information gathering application, where the criteria is set such that only those whose contribution to the group is above some pre-specified threshold can benefit from the contributions of others. The analysis results in a closed form solution for the strategies to be used in equilibrium and facilitates the numerical investigation of different model properties as well as a comparison to the dual mechanism according to only an agent whose contribution is below the specified threshold gets to benefit from the contributions of others. One important contribution enabled through the analysis provided is in showing that, counter-intuitively, for some settings the use of the above-threshold criteria is outperformed by the use of the below-threshold criteria as far as collective and individual performance is concerned",

    "abstract": "The Cooperative Target Observation (CTO) problem has been of great interest in the multi-agents and robotics literature due to the problem being at the core of a number of applications including surveillance. In CTO problem, the observer agents attempt to maximize the collective time during which each moving target is being observed by at least one observer in the area of interest. However, most of the prior works for the CTO problem consider the targets movement to be Randomized. Given our focus on surveillance domain, we modify this assumption to make the targets strategic and present two target strategies namely Straight-line strategy and Controlled Randomization strategy. We then modify the observer strategy proposed in the literature based on the K-means algorithm to introduce five variants and provide experimental validation. In surveillance domain, it is often reasonable to assume that the observers may themselves be a subject of observation for a variety of purposes by unknown adversaries whose model may not be known. Randomizing the observers actions can help to make their target observation strategy less predictable. As the fifth variant, we therefore introduce Adjustable Randomization into the best performing observer strategy where the observer can adjust the expected loss in reward due to randomization depending on the situation",

To address these challenges, we study multiagent planning problems where the collective behavior of a population of agents affects the joint-reward and environment dynamics. Our work exploits recent advances in graphical models for modeling and inference with a population of individuals such as collective graphical models and the notion of finite partial exchangeability in lifted inference. We develop a collective decentralized MDP model where policies can be computed based on counts of agents in different states. As the policy search space over counts is combinatorial, we develop a sampling based framework that can compute open and closed loop policies. Comparisons with previous best approaches on synthetic instances and a real world taxi dataset modeling supply-demand matching show that our approach significantly outperforms them w.r.t. solution quality",

However, there has been little or no research devoted to finding guarantees on solution quality for approximate approaches considering multiple (more than 2 agents) agents. We have a similar situation with respect to the competitive decentralized planning problem and the Stochastic Game (SG) model. To address this, we identify models in the cooperative and competitive case that rely on submodular rewards, where we show that existing approximate approaches can provide strong quality guarantees ( a priori, and for cooperative case also posteriori guarantees).

In this work we go beyond both the \"expectation\" and \"threshold\" approaches and consider a \"guaranteed payoff optimization (GPO)\" problem for POMDPs, where we are given a threshold t and the objective is to find a policy σ such that a) each possible outcome of σ yields a discounted-sum payoff of at least t, and b) the expected discounted-sum payoff of σ is optimal (or near-optimal) among all policies satisfying a).

    "abstract": "Solving constrained combinatorial optimisation problems via MAP inference is often achieved by introducing extra potential functions for each constraint. This can result in very high order potentials, e.g. a 2nd-order objective with pairwise potentials and a quadratic constraint over all N variables would correspond to an unconstrained objective with an order-N potential. This limits the practicality of such an approach, since inference with high order potentials is tractable only for a few special classes of functions. We propose an approach which is able to solve constrained combinatorial problems using belief propagation without increasing the order. For example, in our scheme the 2nd-order problem above remains order 2 instead of order N. Experiments on applications ranging from foreground detection, image reconstruction, quadratic knapsack, and the M-best solutions problem demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our method. Moreover, we show several situations in which our approach outperforms commercial solvers like CPLEX and others designed for specific constrained MAP inference problems",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Human motor behavior is naturally guided by sensing the environment. To predict such sensori-motor behavior, it is necessary to model what is sensed and how actions are chosen based on the obtained sensory measurements. Although several models of human sensing haven been proposed, rarely data of the assumed sensory measurements is available. This makes statistical estimation of sensor models problematic. To overcome this issue, we propose an abstract structural estimation approach building on the ideas of Herman et al.'s Simultaneous Estimation of Rewards and Dynamics (SERD). Assuming optimal fusion of sensory information and rational choice of actions the proposed method allows to infer sensor models even in absence of data of the sensory measurements. To the best of our knowledge, this work presents the first general approach for joint inference of sensor and policy models. Furthermore, we consider its concrete implementation in the important class of sensor scheduling linear quadratic Gaussian problems. Finally, the effectiveness of the approach is demonstrated for prediction of the behavior of automobile drivers. Specifically, we model the glance and steering behavior of driving in the presence of visually demanding secondary tasks. The results show, that prediction benefits from the inference of sensor models. This is the case, especially, if also information is considered, that is contained in gaze switching behavior",

We propose a probabilistic rational temporal logic PRTL*, which extends the logic PCTL* with reasoning about mental attitudes (beliefs, goals and intentions), and includes novel operators that can express concepts of social trust such as competence, disposition and dependence. The logic can express, for example, that \"agent A will eventually trust agent B with probability at least p that B will be have in a way that ensures the successful completion of a given task\".

Regret guarantees for state-of-the-art linear bandit algorithms such as Optimism in the Face of Uncertainty Linear bandit (OFUL) hold under the assumption that the arms expected rewards are perfectly linear in their features. It is, however, of interest to investigate the impact of potential misspecification in linear bandit models, where the expected rewards are perturbed away from the linear subspace determined by the arms features. Although OFUL has recently been shown to be robust to relatively small deviations from linearity, we show that any linear bandit algorithm that enjoys optimal regret performance in the perfectly linear setting (e.g., OFUL) must suffer linear regret under a sparse additive perturbation of the linear model. In an attempt to overcome this negative result,we define a natural class of bandit models characterized by a non-sparse deviation from linearity. We argue that the OFUL algorithm can fail to achieve sublinear regret even under models that have non-sparse deviation. We finally develop a novel bandit algorithm, comprising a hypothesis test for linearity followed by a decision to use either the OFUL or Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) algorithm. For perfectly linear bandit models, the algorithm provably exhibits OFULs favorable regret performance, while for misspecified models satisfying the non-sparse deviation property, the algorithm avoids the linear regret phenomenon and falls back on UCBs sublinear regret scaling. Numerical experiments on synthetic data, and on recommendation data from the public Yahoo! Learning toRank Challenge dataset, empirically support our findings",

Since utility values representing the decision maker's preferences are only partially ordered (e.g., by the Pareto order) we no longer have a unique maximal value of expected utility, but a set of them. Computing the set of maximal values of expected utility and the corresponding policies can be computationally very challenging. In this paper, we consider alternative notions of optimality, one of the most important one being the notion of possibly optimal, namely optimal in at least one scenario compatible with the inter-objective tradeoffs. We develop a variable elimination algorithm for computing the set of possibly optimal expected utility values, prove formally its correctness, and compare variants of the algorithm experimentally",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Several advanced applications of autonomous aerial vehicles in civilian and military contexts involve a searching agent with imperfect sensors that seeks to locate a mobile target in a given region. Effectively managing uncertainty is key to solving the related search problem, which is why all methods devised so far hinge on a probabilistic formulation of the problem and solve it through branch-and-bound algorithms, Bayesian filtering or POMDP solvers. In this paper, we consider a class of hard search tasks involving a target that exhibits an intentional evasive behaviour and moves over a large geographical area, i.e., a target that is particularly difficult to track down and uncertain to locate. We show that, even for such a complex problem, it is advantageous to compile its probabilistic structure into a deterministic model and use standard deterministic solvers to find solutions. In particular, we formulate the search problem for our uncooperative target both as a deterministic automated planning task and as a constraint programming task and show that in both cases our solution outperforms POMDPs methods",

We explore a domain-independent approach based on the framework of hindsight optimization (HOP) for HSA-MDPs, which uses an upper bound on the finite-horizon action values for action selection. Our main contribution is a linear time reduction to a Mixed Integer Linear Program (MILP) that encodes the HOP objective, when the dynamics are specified as location-scale probability distributions parametrized by Piecewise Linear (PWL) functions of states and actions. In addition, we show how to use the same machinery to select actions based on a lower-bound generated by straight line plans.

A fundamental limitation is that the domain of quantification, by construction and design, is assumed to be finite, which is at odds with areas such as vision and language understanding, where the existence of objects must be inferred from raw data. Dropping the finite-domain assumption has been known to improve the expressiveness of a first-order language for open-universe purposes, but these languages, so far, have eluded WMC approaches. In this paper, we revisit relational probabilistic models over an infinite domain, and establish a number of results that permit effective algorithms.

In graphs with cycles, however, no exact convergence guarantees for BP are known, in general. For the case when all edges in the MRF carry the same symmetric, doubly stochastic potential, recent works have proposed to approximate BP by linearizing the update equations around default values, which was shown to work well for the problem of node classification. The present paper generalizes all prior work and derives an approach that approximates loopy BP on any pairwise MRF with the problem of solving a linear equation system. This approach combines exact convergence guarantees and a fast matrix implementation with the ability to model heterogenous networks. Experiments on synthetic graphs with planted edge potentials show that the linearization has comparable labeling accuracy as BP for graphs with weak potentials, while speeding-up inference by orders of magnitude",

We first derive a sufficient and necessary condition for recovering causal effects using covariate adjustment from an observational distribution collected under preferential selection. We then relax this setting to consider cases when additional, unbiased measurements over a set of covariates are available for use (e.g., the age and gender distribution obtained from census data). Finally, we present a complete algorithm with polynomial delay to find all sets of admissible covariates for adjustment when confounding and selection biases are simultaneously present and unbiased data is available",

    "abstract": "WiFi-SLAM aims to map WiFi signals within an unknown environment while simultaneously determining the location of a mobile device. This localization method has been extensively used in indoor, space, undersea, and underground environments. For the sake of accuracy, most methods label the signal readings against ground truth locations. However, this is impractical in large environments, where it is hard to collect and maintain the data. Some methods use latent variable models to generate latent-space locations of signal strength data, an advantage being that no prior labeling of signal strength readings and their physical locations is required. However, the generated latent variables cannot cover all wireless signal locations and WiFi-SLAM performance is significantly degraded. Here we propose the diversified generative latent variable model (DGLVM) to overcome these limitations. By building a positive-definite kernel function, a diversity-encouraging prior is introduced to render the generated latent variables non-overlapping, thus capturing more wireless signal measurements characteristics. The defined objective function is then solved by variational inference. Our experiments illustrate that the method performs WiFi localization more accurately than other label-free methods",

As the risk of costly failures is a major concern with real robots, we propose a risk-aware resampling technique. Contrary to prior work this active learning approach is easy to use with existing solvers for trajectory optimization, as well as deep learning. We demonstrate the efficacy of the approach on a difficult collision avoidance problem with non-cooperative moving obstacles. Our findings indicate that the resulting neural network approximations are least 50 times faster than the trajectory optimizer while still satisfying the safety requirements.

We leverage rich semantic attributes of human, e.g., facing directions, postures and actions, to enhance cross-view tracklet associations, besides frequently used appearance and geometry features in the literature.In particular, the facing direction of a human in 3D, once detected, often coincides with his/her moving direction or trajectory. Similarly, the actions of humans, once recognized, provide strong cues for distinguishing one subject from the others. The inference is solved by iteratively grouping tracklets with cluster sampling and estimating people semantic attributes by dynamic programming.In experiments, we validate our method on one public dataset and create another new dataset that records people's daily life in public, e.g., food court, office reception and plaza, each of which includes 3-4 cameras.

    "abstract": "As an interesting and emerging topic, zero-shot recognition (ZSR) makes it possible to train a recognition model by specifying the category's attributes when there are no labeled exemplars available. The fundamental idea for ZSR is to transfer knowledge from the abundant labeled data in different but related source classes via the class attributes. Conventional ZSR approaches adopt a two-step strategy in test stage, where the samples are projected into the attribute space in the first step, and then the recognition is carried out based on considering the relationship between samples and classes in the attribute space. Due to this intermediate transformation, information loss is unavoidable, thus degrading the performance of the overall system. Rather than following this two-step strategy, in this paper, we propose a novel one-step approach that is able to perform ZSR in the original feature space by using directly trained classifiers. To tackle the problem that no labeled samples of target classes are available, we propose to assign pseudo labels to samples based on the reliability and diversity, which in turn will be used to train the classifiers. Moreover, we adopt a robust SVM that accounts for the unreliability of pseudo labels. Extensive experiments on four datasets demonstrate consistent performance gains of our approach over the state-of-the-art two-step ZSR approaches",

However, the global feature might not effectively capture the relevance between the query object and reference images in the object instance search task, especially when the query object is relatively small and there exist multiple types of objects in reference images. Moreover, the object instance search requires to localize the object in the reference image, which may not be achieved through global representations. In this paper, we propose a Fuzzy Objects Matching (FOM) framework to effectively and efficiently capture the relevance between the query object and reference images in the dataset. In the proposed FOM scheme, object proposals are utilized to detect the potential regions of the query object in reference images. To achieve high search efficiency, we factorize the feature matrix of all the object proposals from one reference image into the product of a set of fuzzy objects and sparse codes. In addition, we refine the feature of the generated fuzzy objects according to its neighborhood in the feature space to generate more robust representation. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed FOM framework significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in precision with less memory and computational cost on three public datasets",

    "abstract": "It has been well known that the user-provided tags of social images are imperfect, i.e., there exist noisy, irrelevant or incomplete tags. It heavily degrades the performance of many multimedia tasks. To alleviate this problem, we propose a Weakly-supervised Deep Nonnegative Low-rank model (WDNL) to improve the quality of tags by integrating the low-rank model with deep feature learning. A nonnegative low-rank model is introduced to uncover the intrinsic relationships between images and tags by simultaneously removing noisy or irrelevant tags and complementing missing tags. The deep architecture is leveraged to seamlessly connect the visual content and the semantic tag. That is, the proposed model can well handle the scalability by assigning tags to new images. Extensive experiments conducted on two real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method compared with some state-of-the-art methods",

    "abstract": "We present a novel approach to online multi-target tracking based on recurrent neural networks (RNNs). Tracking multiple objects in real-world scenes involves many challenges, including a) an a-priori unknown and time-varying number of targets, b) a continuous state estimation of all present targets, and c) a discrete combinatorial problem of data association. Most previous methods involve complex models that require tedious tuning of parameters. Here, we propose for the first time, an end-to-end learning approach for online multi-target tracking. Existing deep learning methods are not designed for the above challenges and cannot be trivially applied to the task. Our solution addresses all of the above points in a principled way. Experiments on both synthetic and real data show promising results obtained at ~300 Hz on a standard CPU, and pave the way towards future research in this direction",

The method iteratively recovers the point correspondence and estimates the spatial transformation between two point sets. The correspondence is established based on existing local feature descriptors which typically results in a number of outliers. To achieve an accurate estimate of the transformation from such putative point correspondence, we formulate the registration problem by a mixture model with a set of latent variables introduced to identify outliers, and a prior involving manifold regularization is imposed on the transformation to capture the underlying intrinsic geometry of the input data. The non-rigid transformation is specified in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space and a sparse approximation is adopted to achieve a fast implementation.

But despite their popularity, the ``correctness'' of the implicitly-learned attention maps has only been assessed qualitatively by visualization of several examples. In this paper we focus on evaluating and improving the correctness of attention in neural image captioning models. Specifically, we propose a quantitative evaluation metric for the consistency between the generated attention maps and human annotations, using recently released datasets with alignment between regions in images and entities in captions. We then propose novel models with different levels of explicit supervision for learning attention maps during training. The supervision can be strong when alignment between regions and caption entities are available, or weak when only object segments and categories are provided. We show on the popular Flickr30k and COCO datasets that introducing supervision of attention maps during training solidly improves both attention correctness and caption quality, showing the promise of making machine perception more human-like",

There are two main problems in existing methods: in the training phase, it is difficult to find which parts of the captions are more essential to the image; in the caption generation phase, the objects or the scenes are sometimes misrecognized. In this paper, we consider the training images as the references and propose a Reference based Long Short Term Memory (R-LSTM) model, aiming to solve these two problems in one goal. When training the model, we assign different weights to different words, which enables the network to better learn the key information of the captions. When generating a caption, the consensus score is utilized to exploit the reference information of neighbor images, which might fix the misrecognition and make the descriptions more natural-sounding.

    "abstract": "Existing visual tracking methods usually localize the object with a bounding box, in which the foreground object trackers/detectors are often disturbed by the introduced background information. To handle this problem, we aim to learn a more robust object representation for visual tracking. In particular, the tracked object is represented with a graph structure (i.e., a set of non-overlapping image patches), in which the weight of each node (patch) indicates how likely it belongs to the foreground and edges are also weighed for indicating the appearance compatibility of two neighboring nodes. This graph is dynamically learnt (i.e., the nodes and edges received weights) and applied in object tracking and model updating. We constrain the graph learning from two aspects: i) the global low-rank structure over all nodes and ii) the local sparseness of node neighbors. During the tracking process, our method performs the following steps at each frame. First, the graph is initialized by assigning either 1 or 0 to the weights of some image patches according to the predicted bounding box. Second, the graph is optimized through designing a new ALM (Augmented Lagrange Multiplier) based algorithm. Third, the object feature representation is updated by imposing the weights of patches on the extracted image features. The object location is finally predicted by adopting the Struck tracker.

To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to integrate both tasks in one network to solve the person ReID. We show that our proposed architecture significantly boosts the performance. Furthermore, deep architecture in general requires a sufficient dataset for training, which is usually not met in person ReID.

In this paper, a novel clustering algorithm, called Saliency-Guided Constrained Clustering approach with Cosine similarity (SGC3), is proposed for the image cosegmentation task, where the common foregrounds are extracted via a one-step clustering process. In our method, the unsupervised saliency prior is utilized as a partition-level side information to guide the clustering process. To guarantee the robustness to noise and outlier in the given prior, the similarities of instance-level and partition-level are jointly computed for cosegmentation. Specifically, we employ cosine distance to calculate the feature similarity between data point and its cluster centroid, and introduce a cosine utility function to measure the similarity between clustering result and the side information. These two parts are both based on the cosine similarity, which is able to capture the intrinsic structure of data, especially for the non-spherical cluster structure. Finally, a K-means-like optimization is designed to solve our objective function in an efficient way.

    "abstract": "Hashing has been proven a promising technique for fast nearest neighbor search over massive databases. In many practical tasks it usually builds multiple hash tables for a desired level of recall performance. However, existing multi-table hashing methods suffer from the heavy table redundancy, without strong table complementarity and effective hash code learning. To address the problem, this paper proposes a multi-table learning method which pursues a specified number of complementary and informative hash tables from a perspective of ensemble learning. By regarding each hash table as a neighbor prediction model, the multi-table search procedure boils down to a linear assembly of predictions stemming from multiple tables. Therefore, a sequential updating and learning framework is naturally established in a boosting mechanism, theoretically guaranteeing the table complementarity and algorithmic convergence. Furthermore, each boosting round pursues the discriminative hash functions for each table by a discrete optimization in the binary code space. Extensive experiments carried out on two popular tasks including Euclidean and semantic nearest neighbor search demonstrate that the proposed boosted complementary hash-tables method enjoys the strong table complementarity and significantly outperforms the state-of-the-arts",

To address this problem, we propose a novel local-global correlation filter (LGCF) for object tracking. Our LGCF model utilizes both local-based and global-based strategies, and effectively combines these two strategies by exploiting the relationship of circular shifts among local object parts and global target for their motion models to preserve the structure of object. In specific, our proposed model has two advantages: (1) Owing to the benefits of local-based mechanism, our method is robust to partial occlusion by leveraging visible parts. (2) Taking into account the relationship of motion models among local parts and global target, our LGCF model is able to capture the inner structure of object, which further improves its robustness to occlusion. In addition, to alleviate the issue of drift away from object, we incorporate temporal consistencies of both local parts and global target in our LGCF model.

Traditional model-based search is usually not convenient, since people don't always have 3D model available by side. The sketch-based 3D shape retrieval is a promising candidate due to its simpleness and efficiency. The main challenge for sketch-based 3D shape retrieval is the discrepancy across different domains. In the paper, we propose a novel deep correlated metric learning (DCML) method to mitigate the discrepancy between sketch and 3D shape domains. The proposed DCML trains two distinct deep neural networks (one for each domain) jointly with one loss, which learns two deep nonlinear transformations to map features from both domains into a nonlinear feature space. The proposed loss, including discriminative loss and correlation loss, aims to increase the discrimination of features within each domain as well as the correlation between different domains. In the transfered space, the discriminative loss minimizes the intra-class distance of the deep transformed features and maximizes the inter-class distance of the deep transformed features at least a predefined margin within each domain, while the correlation loss focuses on minimizing the distribution discrepancy across different domains. Our proposed method is evaluated on SHREC 2013 and 2014 benchmarks, and the experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method over the state-of-the-art methods",

Extracting discriminative spatial and temporal features to model the spatial and temporal evolutions of different actions plays a key role in accomplishing this task. In this work, we propose an end-to-end spatial and temporal attention model for human action recognition from skeleton data. We build our model on top of the Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), which learns to selectively focus on discriminative joints of skeleton within each frame of the inputs and pays different levels of attention to the outputs of different frames. Furthermore, to ensure effective training of the network, we propose a regularized cross-entropy loss to drive the model learning process and develop a joint training strategy accordingly.

The proposed algorithm alternates between generating segmentation annotations and learning a semantic segmentation network using the generated annotations. A key determinant of success in this framework is the capability to construct reliable initial annotations given image-level labels only. To this end, we propose Superpixel Pooling Network (SPN), which utilizes superpixel segmentation of input image as a pooling layout to reflect low-level image structure for learning and inferring semantic segmentation. The initial annotations generated by SPN are then used to learn another neural network that estimates pixel-wise semantic labels. The architecture of the segmentation network decouples semantic segmentation task into classification and segmentation so that the network learns class-agnostic shape prior from the noisy annotations. It turns out that both networks are critical to improve semantic segmentation accuracy. The proposed algorithm achieves outstanding performance in weakly supervised semantic segmentation task compared to existing techniques on the challenging PASCAL VOC 2012 segmentation benchmark",

Existing visual recognition systems are typically modeled differently for each fact type such as objects, actions, and interactions. We propose a setting where all these facts can be modeled simultaneously with a capacity to understand an unbounded number of facts in a structured way. The training data comes as structured facts in images, including (1) objects (e.g., <boy>), (2) attributes (e.g., <boy, tall>), (3) actions (e.g., <boy, playing>), and (4) interactions (e.g., <boy, riding, a horse >). Each fact has a semantic language view (e.g., < boy, playing>) and a visual view (an image with this fact). We show that learning visual facts in a structured way enables not only a uniform but also generalizable visual understanding. We propose and investigate recent and strong approaches from the multiview learning literature and also introduce two learning representation models as potential baselines. We applied the investigated methods on several datasets that we augmented with structured facts and a large scale dataset of more than 202,000 facts and 814,000 images.

In this paper, we propose a new variant o diffusion process, which also operates on a tensor product graph. It is defined in three equivalent formulations (regularization framework, iterative framework and limit framework, respectively).

Specially, the full-scale feature network (FFN) extends the full-connected network and makes an end-to-end unified training structure. It has two appealing properties. First, the introduction of full-scale-features is beneficial for prediction. We build a unified extracting network and explore several fusion functions for concatenating features. Amounts of experiments have been carried out to prove that full-scale-features makes fair accuracy raising. Second, FFN is applicable to many variants of FCN which could be regarded as a general strategy to improve the segmentation accuracy.

This paper presents a compact coding solution for efficient cross-modal retrieval, with a focus on the quantization approach which has already shown the superior performance over the hashing solutions in single-modal similarity retrieval. We propose a collective deep quantization (CDQ) approach, which is the first attempt to introduce quantization in end-to-end deep architecture for cross-modal retrieval. The major contribution lies in jointly learning deep representations and the quantizers for both modalities using carefully-crafted hybrid networks and well-specified loss functions. In addition, our approach simultaneously learns the common quantizer codebook for both modalities through which the cross-modal correlation can be substantially enhanced. CDQ enables efficient and effective cross-modal retrieval using inner product distance computed based on the common codebook with fast distance table lookup.

A novel objectness metric is proposed to score and rank the proposal boxes by considering the sizes and edge intensities of the closed contours. To improve the edge detector given the top-down object proposals, we group local closed contours and construct global object hierarchies and segmentations. The edge detector is retrained and enhanced using these hierarchical segmentations as additional feature channels.

However, this often leads to tracking drift problem because of potentially corrupted samples: 1) contaminated/outlier samples resulting from large variations (e.g. occlusion, illumination), and 2) misaligned samples caused by tracking inaccuracy. Therefore, in order to reduce the tracking drift while maintaining the adaptability of a visual tracker, how to alleviate these two issues via an effective model learning (updating) strategy is a key problem to be solved. To address these issues, this paper proposes a novel and optimal model learning (updating) scheme which aims to simultaneously eliminate the negative effects from these two issues mentioned above in a unified robust feature template learning framework. Particularly, the proposed feature template learning framework is capable of: 1) adaptively learning uncontaminated feature templates by separating out contaminated samples, and 2) resolving label ambiguities caused by misaligned samples via a probabilistic multiple instance learning (MIL) model.

    "abstract": "Person re-identification (re-id) plays an important role in video surveillance and forensics applications. In many cases, person re-id needs to be conducted between image and video clip, e.g., re-identifying a suspect from large quantities of pedestrian videos given a single image of him. We call re-id in this scenario as image to video person re-id (IVPR). In practice, image and video are usually represented with different features, and there usually exist large variations between frames within each video. These factors make matching between image and video become a very challenging task. In this paper, we propose a joint feature projection matrix and heterogeneous dictionary pair learning (PHDL) approach for IVPR. Specifically, PHDL jointly learns an intra-video projection matrix and a pair of heterogeneous image and video dictionaries. With the learned projection matrix, the influence of variations within each video to the matching can be reduced. With the learned dictionary pair, the heterogeneous image and video features can be transformed into coding coefficients with the same dimension, such that the matching can be conducted using coding coefficients. Furthermore, to ensure that the obtained coding coefficients have favorable discriminability, PHDL designs a point-to-set coefficient discriminant term.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Fine-grained image classification is challenging due to the large intra-class variance and small inter-class variance, aiming at recognizing hundreds of sub-categories belonging to the same basic-level category. Since two different sub-categories is distinguished only by the subtle differences in some specific parts, semantic part localization is crucial for fine-grained image classification. Most previous works improve the accuracy by looking for the semantic parts, but rely heavily upon the use of the object or part annotations of images whose labeling are costly. Recently, some researchers begin to focus on recognizing sub-categories via weakly supervised part detection instead of using the expensive annotations. However, these works ignore the spatial relationship between the object and its parts as well as the interaction of the parts, both of them are helpful to promote part selection. Therefore, this paper proposes a weakly supervised part selection method with spatial constraints for fine-grained image classification, which is free of using any bounding box or part annotations. We first learn a whole-object detector automatically to localize the object through jointly using saliency extraction and co-segmentation. Then two spatial constraints are proposed to select the distinguished parts. The first spatial constraint, called box constraint, defines the relationship between the object and its parts, and aims to ensure that the selected parts are definitely located in the object region, and have the largest overlap with the object region. The second spatial constraint, called parts constraint, defines the relationship of the object's parts, is to reduce the parts' overlap with each other to avoid the information redundancy and ensure the selected parts are the most distinguishing parts from other categories. Combining two spatial constraints promotes parts selection significantly as well as achieves a notable improvement on fine-grained image classification. Experimental results on CUB-200-2011 dataset demonstrate the superiority of our method even compared with those methods using expensive annotations",

To tackle this problem, we present a generative model, i.e., Latent Regression Bayesian Network (LRBN), to effectively capture the spatial patterns embedded in facial landmark points to differentiate between posed and spontaneous facial expressions. The LRBN is a directed graphical model consisting of one latent layer and one visible layer. Due to the \"explaining away\" effect in Bayesian networks, LRBN is able to capture both the dependencies among the latent variables given the observation and the dependencies among visible variables. We believe that such dependencies are crucial for faithful data representation. Specifically, during training, we construct two LRBNs to capture spatial patterns inherent in displacements of landmark points from spontaneous facial expressions and posed facial expressions respectively. During testing, the samples are classified into posed or spontaneous expressions according to their likelihoods on two models. Efficient learning and inference algorithms are proposed.

In contrast, current RGB-D scene data is much more limited, so often leverages RGB large datasets, by transferring pretrained RGB CNN models and fine-tuning with the target RGB-D dataset. However, we show that this approach has the limitation of hardly reaching bottom layers, which is key to learn modality-specific features. In contrast, we focus on the bottom layers, and propose an alternative strategy to learn depth features combining local weakly supervised training from patches followed by global fine tuning with images. This strategy is capable of learning very discriminative depth-specific features with limited depth images, without resorting to Places-CNN. In addition we propose a modified CNN architecture to further match the complexity of the model and the amount of data available. For RGB-D scene recognition, depth and RGB features are combined by projecting them in a common space and further leaning a multilayer classifier, which is jointly optimized in an end-to-end network.

Also different actions, e.g., walking vs. jogging, may share similar poses which makes the representation not discriminative to differentiate the actions. To solve the problems, we propose a novel representation for 3D poses by a mixture of Discriminative Activated Simplices (DAS). Each DAS consists of a few bases and represent pose data by their convex combinations. The discriminative power of DAS is firstly realized by learning discriminative bases across classes with a block diagonal constraint enforced on the basis coefficient matrix. Secondly, the DAS provides tight characterization of the pose manifolds thus reducing the chance of generating overlapped DAS between similar classes.

    "title": "Attributes for Improved Attributes: A Multi-Task Network Utilizing Implicit and Explicit Relationships for Facial Attribute Classification",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Attributes, or mid-level semantic features, have gained popularity in the past few years in domains ranging from activity recognition to face verification. Improving the accuracy of attribute classifiers is an important first step in any application which uses these attributes. In most works to date, attributes have been considered independent of each other. However, attributes can be strongly related, such as heavy makeup and wearing lipstick as well as male and goatee and many others. We propose a multi-task deep convolutional neural network (MCNN) with an auxiliary network at the top (AUX) which takes advantage of attribute relationships for improved classification. We call our final network MCNN-AUX. MCNN-AUX uses attribute relationships in three ways: by sharing the lowest layers for all attributes, by sharing the higher layers for spatially-related attributes, and by feeding the attribute scores from MCNN into the AUX network to find score-level relationships. Using MCNN-AUX rather than individual attribute classifiers, we are able to reduce the number of parameters in the network from 64 million to fewer than 16 million and reduce the training time by a factor of 16. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method by producing results on two challenging publicly available datasets achieving state-of-the-art performance on many attributes",

    "title": "An Artificial Agent for Robust Image Registration",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "3-D image registration, which involves aligning two or more images, is a critical step in a variety of medical applications from diagnosis to therapy. Image registration is commonly performed by optimizing an image matching metric as a cost function. However this task is challenging due to the non-convex nature of the matching metric over the plausible registration parameter space and insufficient approches for a robust optimization. As a result, current approaches are often customized to a specific problem and sensitive to image quality and artifacts. In this paper, we propose a completely different approach to image registration, inspired by how experts perform the task. We first cast the image registration problem as a \"strategic learning\" process, where the goal is to find the best sequence of motion actions (e.g. up, down, etc) that yields image alignment. Within this approach, an artificial agent is learned, modeled using deep convolutional neural networks, with 3D raw image data as the input, and the next optimal action as the output. To copy with the dimensionality of the problem, we propose a greedy supervised approach for an end-to-end training, coupled with attention-driven hierarchical strategy. The resulting registration approach inherently encodes both a data-driven matching metric and an optimal registration strategy (policy). We demonstrate on two 3-D/3-D medical image registration examples with drastically different nature of challenges, that the artificial agent outperforms several state-of-the-art registration methods by a large margin in terms of both accuracy and robustness",

    "abstract": "Very deep convolutional networks have been central to the largest advances in image recognition performance in recent years. One example is the Inception architecture that has been shown to achieve very good performance at relatively low computational cost. Recently, the introduction of residual connections in conjunction with a more traditional architecture has yielded state-of-the-art performance in the 2015 ILSVRC challenge; its performance was similar to the latest generation Inception-v3 network. This raises the question: Are there any benefits to combining Inception architectures with residual connections? Here we give clear empirical evidence that training with residual connections accelerates the training of Inception networks significantly. There is also some evidence of residual Inception networks outperforming similarly expensive Inception networks without residual connections by a thin margin. We also present several new streamlined architectures for both residual and non-residual Inception networks. These variations improve the single-frame recognition performance on the ILSVRC 2012 classification task significantly. We further demonstrate how proper activation scaling stabilizes the training of very wide residual Inception networks. With an ensemble of three residual and one Inception-v4 networks, we achieve 3.08% top-5 error on the test set of the ImageNet classification (CLS) challenge",

Specifically, we extend the classical fully connected layer such that it is suitable for SPD matrices, and we further show that SPD matrices with symmetric pair elements setting zero operations are still symmetric positive definite.

We desire a computer vision system (e.g., a robot) that can recognize human activities and assist our daily life, yet ensure that it is not recording video that may invade our privacy. This paper presents a fundamental approach to address such contradicting objectives: human activity recognition while only using extreme low-resolution (e.g., 16x12) anonymized videos. We introduce the paradigm of inverse super resolution (ISR), the concept of learning the optimal set of image transformations to generate multiple low-resolution (LR) training videos from a single video. Our ISR learns different types of sub-pixel transformations optimized for the activity classification, allowing the classifier to best take advantage of existing high-resolution videos (e.g., YouTube videos) by creating multiple LR training videos tailored for the problem. We experimentally confirm that the paradigm of inverse super resolution is able to benefit activity recognition from extreme low-resolution videos",

    "abstract": "To facilitate the browsing of long videos, automatic video summarization provides an excerpt that represents its content. In the case of egocentric and consumer videos, due to their personal nature, adapting the summary to specific user's preferences is desirable. Current approaches to customizable video summarization obtain the user's preferences prior to the summarization process. As a result, the user needs to manually modify the summary to further meet the preferences. In this paper, we introduce Active Video Summarization (AVS), an interactive approach to gather the user's preferences while creating the summary. AVS asks questions about the summary to update it on-line until the user is satisfied. To minimize the interaction, the best segment to inquire next is inferred from the previous feedback. We evaluate AVS in the commonly used UTEgo dataset. We also introduce a new dataset for customized video summarization (CSumm) recorded with a Google Glass. The results show that AVS achieves an excellent compromise between usability and quality. In 41% of the videos, AVS is considered the best over all tested baselines, including summaries manually generated. Also, when looking for specific events in the video, AVS provides an average level of satisfaction higher than those of all other baselines after only six questions to the user",

    "title": "Leveraging Saccades to Learn Smooth Pursuit: A Self-Organizing Motion Tracking Model Using Restricted Boltzmann Machines",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a biologically-plausible model to explain the emergence of motion tracking behaviour in early development using unsupervised learning. The model's training is biased by a concept called retinal constancy, which measures how similar visual contents are between successive frames. This biasing is similar to a reward in reinforcement learning, but is less explicit, as it modulates the model's learning rate instead of being a learning signal itself. The model is a two-layer deep network. The first layer learns to encode visual motion, and the second layer learns to relate that motion to gaze movements, which it perceives and creates through bi-directional nodes. By randomly generating gaze movements to traverse the local visual space, desirable correlations are developed between visual motion and the appropriate gaze to nullify that motion such that maximal retinal constancy is achieved. Biologically, this is similar to using saccades to look around and learning from moments where a target and the saccade move together such that the image stays the same on the retina, and developing smooth pursuit behaviour to perform this action in the future. Restricted Boltzmann machines are used to implement this model because they can form a deep belief network, perform online learning, and act generatively. These properties all have biological equivalents and coincide with the biological plausibility of using saccades as leverage to learn smooth pursuit. This method is unique because it uses general machine learning algorithms, and their inherent generative properties, to learn from real-world data. It also implements a biological theory, uses motion instead of recognition via local searches, without temporal filtering, and learns in a fully unsupervised manner. Its tracking performance after being trained on real-world images with simulated motion is compared to its tracking performance after being trained on natural video. Results show that this model is able to successfully follow targets in natural video, despite partial occlusions, scale changes, and nonlinear motion",

Thus, our proposed method can pay more attention to how to predict the salient objects more precisely with high recall while keeping context information at image-level cocurrently.

However, existing techniques restrict the model learning on the pairs of each video and its own sentences, and thus fail to capture more holistically semantic relationships among all sentences. In this paper, we propose to model relative relationships of different video-sentence pairs and present a novel framework, named Long Short-Term Memory with Listwise Supervision (LSTM-LS), for video captioning. Given each video in training data, we obtain a ranking list of sentences w.r.t. a given sentence associated with the video using nearest-neighbor search. The ranking information is represented by a set of rank triplets that can be used to assess the quality of ranking list. The video captioning problem is then solved by learning LSTM model for sentence generation, through maximizing the ranking quality over all the sentences in the list. The experiments on MSVD dataset show that our proposed LSTM-LS produces better performance than the state of the art in generating natural sentences: 51.1% and 32.6% in terms of BLEU@4 and METEOR, respectively.

Our temporal filters are designed to be fully differentiable, allowing end-of-end training of the temporal filters together with the underlying frame-based or segment-based convolutional neural network architectures. This paper presents an approach of learning a set of optimal static temporal attention filters to be shared across different videos, and extends this approach to dynamically adjust attention filters per testing video using recurrent long short-term memory networks (LSTMs).

Therefore, a video recovery model which utilizes both video spatiotemporal consistency and variation is necessary. To solve this problem, we propose a new video recovery method Sectional Trace Norm with Variation and Consistency Constraints (STN-VCC). In our model, capped L1-norm regularization is utilized to learn the spatial-temporal consistency and variation between consecutive frames in video clips. Meanwhile, we introduce a new low-rank model to capture the low-rank structure in video frames with a better approximation of rank minimization than traditional trace norm.

    "abstract": "In this abstract, we present a novel method using the deep convolutional neural network combined with traditional mechanical control techniques to solve the problem of determining whether a robotic grasp is successful or not. To finish the task, we construct a data acquisition platform capable of robot arm grasping and photo capturing, and collect a diversity of pictures by adjusting the shape and posture of the objects and controlling the robot arm to move randomly. For the purpose of validating the generalization capability, we adopt a stochastic sampling method based on cross validation to test our model. The experiment shows that, with an increasing number of shapes of objects involved in training, the network can identify new samples in a more accurate and steadier way. The accuracy rises from 89.2% when we use only one category of shape for training to above 99.7% when we use 17 categories for training",

Many existing approaches learn the matching model mainly based on the semantic similarity between questions and answers, which can not effectively handle the ambiguity problem of questions and the sparsity problem of CQA data. In this paper, we propose to solve these two problems by exploiting users' social contexts. Specifically, we propose a novel framework for CQA task by exploiting both the question-answer content in CQA site and users' social contexts.

    "abstract": "The LSTM model presented is capable of describing a user of a particular website without human expert supervision. In other words, the model is able to automatically craft features which depict attitude, intention and the overall state of a user. This effect is achieved by projecting the complex history of the user (sequence data corresponding to his actions on the website) into fixed-size vectors of real numbers. The representation obtained may be used to enrich typical models used in e-commerce: click-through rate, conversion rate, recommender systems etc. The goal of this paper is to demonstrate a way of creating the mentioned projection, which we called user2vec, and present possible benefits of incorporating this solution to enhance conversion rate model. Thus enriched model's superiority is due not only to its increased internal complexity but also to its capability of learning from wider data – it indirectly analyzes actions of all website users, rather than being limited to the users who clicked on an ad",

To overcome shortcomings of the existing approaches, we propose a novel architecture based on deep convolutional neural network, namely Shape Regression Network(SReN), to detect storyboards within comic images. Firstly, we use Fast R-CNN to generate rectangle bounding boxes as storyboard proposals. Then we train a deep neural network to predict quadrangles for these propos- als. Unlike existing object detection methods which only output rectangle bounding boxes, SReN can produce more precise quadrangle bounding boxes. Experimental results, evaluating on 7382 comic pages, demonstrate that SReN outperforms the state-of-the-art methods by more than 10% in terms of F1-score and page correction rate",

Herewe achieve this by means of a field-programmable gate array (FPGA), and demonstrate the first photonic reservoircomputer with output feedback.

Here we propose the online learning approach to solve these issues. We present an experimental reservoir computer with a simple analogue readout layer, based on previous works, and show numerically that online learning allows to disregard the added complexity of an analogue layer and obtain the same level of performance as with a digital layer.

The decision process of the participants is determined by how good they are in evaluating the probability of future risk as well as their ability to anticipate the actions of the opponents. Anticipatory behavior contrasts with the reactive theories often used to analyze social dilemmas. Our initial work can already show that anticipative agents are a better model to human behavior than reactive ones. All the agents we studied used a recurrent neural network, however, only the ones that used it to predict future outcomes (anticipative agents) were able to account for changes in the context of games, a behavior also observed in experiments with humans. This extended abstract aims to explain how we wish to investigate anticipation within the context of the collective-risk game and the relevance these results may have for the field of hybrid socio-technical systems",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "The introduction of smart meters has motivated the electricity industry to manage electrical demand, using dynamic pricing schemes such as real-time pricing. The overall aim of demand management is to minimize electricity generation and distribution costs while meeting the demands and preferences of consumers. However, rapidly scheduling consumption of large groups of households is a challenge. In this paper, we present a highly scalable approach to find the optimal consumption levels for households in an iterative and distributed manner. The complexity of this approach is independent of the number of households, which allows it to be applied to problems with large groups of households. Moreover, the intermediate results of this approach can be used by smart meters to schedule tasks with a simple randomized method",

Nowadays, 3D point clouds, a new 3D representation of real-world objects, can be easily and rapidly collected by mobile LiDAR systems, e.g. RIEGL VMX-450 system. Moreover, the mobile LiDAR system can also provide a series of consecutive multi-view images which are calibrated with 3D point clouds. This paper proposes to automatically annotate 3D objects of interest in point clouds of road scenes by exploiting a multitude of annotated images in image databases, such as LabelMe and ImageNet. In the proposed method, an object detector trained on the annotated images is used to locate the object regions in acquired multi-view images. Then, based on the correspondences between multi-view images and 3D point clouds, a probabilistic graphical model is used to model the temporal, spatial and geometric constraints to extract the 3D objects automatically. A new dataset was built for evaluation and the experimental results demonstrate a satisfied performance on 3D object extraction",

We modify the algorithm for enforcing POAC to operate on a minimum cycle basis (MCB) of the incidence graph of the CSP.

As security knowledge evolves, what may be considered ground truth at one moment in time may change, and apps once considered benign may turn out to be malicious. The inevitable noise in data labels poses a challenge to inferring effective machine learning classifiers. Our work is focused on approaches for learning classifiers for Android malware detection in a manner that is methodologically sound with regard to the uncertain and ever-changing ground truth in the problem space. We leverage the fact that although data labels are unavoidably noisy, a malware label is much more precise than a benign label. While you can be confident that an app is malicious, you can never be certain that a benign app is really benign, or just undetected malware. Based on this insight, we leverage a modified Logistic Regression classifier that allows us to learn from only positive and unlabeled data, without making any assumptions about benign labels. We find Label Regularized Logistic Regression to perform well for noisy app datasets, as well as datasets where there is a limited amount of positive labeled data, both of which are representative of real-world situations",

On the other hand, temporal reasoning formalisms have a number of potential practical applications, e.g., in task scheduling, action planning, and temporal databases. Temporal reasoning methods may be divided into point-based and interval-based depending on the type of the considered primitive ontological objects. My work revolves around the latter type of methods which seem to be more human-like and more suitable for such applications as continuous process modelling. My main result is that the satisfiability problem in a hybridized fragment of Halpern-Shoham logic in which formulas are in a form of conjunction of Horn clauses and only box modal operators are allowed (diamond operators are disallowed) is NP-complete over reflexive, as well as over irreflexive and dense time frames.

    "title": "Coalition Structure Generation Utilizing Graphical Representation of Partition Function Games",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Forming effective coalition is a central research challenge in AI and multi-agent systems. The Coalition Structure Generation (CSG) problem is well-known as one of major research topics in coalitional games. The CSG problem is to partition a set of agents into coalitions so that the sum of utilities is maximized. This paper studies a CSG problem for partition function games (PFGs), where the value of a coalition differs depending on the formation of other coalitions generated by non-member agents. Traditionally, in PFGs, the input of a coalitional game is a black-box function called a partition function that maps an embedded coalition (a coalition and the coalition structure) to its value. Recently, a novel concise representation scheme called the Partition Decision Trees (PDTs) has been proposed. The PDTs is a graphical representation based on multiple rules. In this paper, we propose new algorithms that can solve a CSG problem by utilizing PDTs representation. More specifically, we modify PDTs representation to effectively handle negative value rules and apply the depth-first branch and bound algorithm. We experimentally show that our algorithm can solve a CSG problem well",

We present a finite memory automaton (FMA) designed to solve static and dynamic MAB problems.

If applicable, this procedure could be used to verify users after they have gained entry into a protected system using data that is as human-centric as other biometrics, but less invasive. For this study an Extreme Gradient Boosting algorithm was used for training and testing on a dataset containing keystroke dynamics information. This specific algorithm was chosen because the majority of current research utilizes mainstream methods such as KNN and SVM and the hypothesis of this study was centered on the potential applicability of ensemble related decision or model trees.

However, many distinct graphs may be consistent with M, and a data modeler may wish to select among these using domain knowledge. In this paper, we present a method that makes this possible. We introduce PAG2ADMG, the first method for enumerating all causal graphs consistent with M, under certain assumptions.

Designing an associative memory requires addressing two main tasks: 1) learning phase: given a dataset, learn a concise representation of the dataset in the form of a graphical model (or a neural network), 2) recall phase: given a noisy version of a message vector from the dataset, output the correct message vector via a neurally feasible algorithm over the network learnt during the learning phase. This paper studies the problem of designing a class of neural associative memories which learns a network representation for a large dataset that ensures correction against a large number of adversarial errors during the recall phase. Specifically, the associative memories designed in this paper can store dataset containing exp(n) n-length message vectors over a network with O(n) nodes and can tolerate Ω(n / polylog) adversarial errors. This paper carries out this memory design by mapping the learning phase and recall phase to the tasks of dictionary learning with a square dictionary and iterative error correction in an expander code, respectively",

Through human subject experimentation, we empirically demonstrate that this approach results in statistically significant improvements to plan quality, without substantially increasing computation time.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Feature selection aims to select a small subset from the high-dimensional features which can lead to better learning performance, lower computational complexity, and better model readability. The class imbalance problem has been neglected by traditional feature selection methods, therefore the selected features will be biased towards the majority classes. Because of the superiority of F-measure to accuracy for imbalanced data, we propose to use F-measure as the performance measure for feature selection algorithms. As a pseudo-linear function, the optimization of F-measure can be achieved by minimizing the total costs. In this paper, we present a novel cost-sensitive feature selection (CSFS) method which optimizes F-measure instead of accuracy to take class imbalance issue into account. The features will be selected according to optimal F-measure classifier after solving a series of cost-sensitive feature selection sub-problems. The features selected by our method will fully represent the characteristics of not only majority classes, but also minority classes. Extensive experimental results conducted on synthetic, multi-class and multi-label datasets validate the efficiency and significance of our feature selection method",

    "abstract": "Kernel learning is a fundamental problem both in recent research and application of kernel methods. Existing kernel learning methods commonly use some measures of generalization errors to learn the optimal kernel in a convex (or conic) combination of prescribed basic kernels. However, the generalization bounds derived by these measures usually have slow convergence rates, and the basic kernels are finite and should be specified in advance. In this paper, we propose a new kernel learning method based on a novel measure of generalization error, called principal eigenvalue proportion (PEP), which can learn the optimal kernel with sharp generalization bounds over the convex hull of a possibly infinite set of basic kernels. We first derive sharp generalization bounds based on the PEP measure. Then we design two kernel learning algorithms for finite kernels and infinite kernels respectively, in which the derived sharp generalization bounds are exploited to guarantee faster convergence rates, moreover, basic kernels can be learned automatically for infinite kernel learning instead of being prescribed in advance. Theoretical analysis and empirical results demonstrate that the proposed kernel learning method outperforms the state-of-the-art kernel learning methods",

    "abstract": "While much research effort has been dedicated to scaling up sparse Gaussian process (GP) models based on inducing variables for big data, little attention is afforded to the other less explored class of low-rank GP approximations that exploit the sparse spectral representation of a GP kernel. This paper presents such an effort to advance the state of the art of sparse spectrum GP models to achieve competitive predictive performance for massive datasets. Our generalized framework of stochastic variational Bayesian sparse spectrum GP (sVBSSGP) models addresses their shortcomings by adopting a Bayesian treatment of the spectral frequencies to avoid overfitting, modeling these frequencies jointly in its variational distribution to enable their interaction a posteriori, and exploiting local data for boosting the predictive performance. However, such structural improvements result in a variational lower bound that is intractable to be optimized. To resolve this, we exploit a variational parameterization trick to make it amenable to stochastic optimization. Interestingly, the resulting stochastic gradient has a linearly decomposable structure that can be exploited to refine our stochastic optimization method to incur constant time per iteration while preserving its property of being an unbiased estimator of the exact gradient of the variational lower bound. Empirical evaluation on real-world datasets shows that sVBSSGP outperforms state-of-the-art stochastic implementations of sparse GP models",

    "abstract": "Curriculum Learning (CL) mimics the cognitive process ofhumans and favors a learning algorithm to follow the logical learning sequence from simple examples to more difficult ones. Recent studies show that selecting the simplest curriculum examples from different modalities for graph-based label propagation can yield better performance than simply leveraging single modality. However, they forcibly requirethe curriculums generated by all modalities to be identical to a common curriculum, which discard the individuality ofevery modality and produce the inaccurate curriculum for the subsequent learning. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel multi-modal CL algorithm by comprehensively investigating both the individuality and commonality of different modalities. By considering the curriculums of multiple modalities altogether, their common preference on selecting the simplestexamples can be explored by a row-sparse matrix, and their distinct opinions are captured by a sparse noise matrix. As a consequence, a \"soft\" fusion of multiple curriculums from different modalities is achieved and the propagation quality can thus be improved. Comprehensive empirical studies reveal that our method can generate higher accuracy than the state-of-the-art multi-modal CL approach and label propagation algorithms on various image classification tasks",

The common discriminative solution to learn from partial label examples assumes one parametric model for each class label, whose predictions are aggregated to optimize specific objectives such as likelihood or margin over the training examples. Nonetheless, existing discriminative approaches treat the predictions from all parametric models in an equal manner, where the confidence of each candidate label being the ground-truth label is not differentiated. In this paper, a boosting-style partial label learning approach is proposed to enabling confidence-rated discriminative modeling. Specifically, the ground-truth confidence of each candidate label is maintained in each boosting round and utilized to train the base classifier. Extensive experiments on artificial as well as real-world partial label data sets validate the effectiveness of the confidence-rated discriminative modeling",

Previous studies have shown that imposing a low-rank constraint on tensor completion produces impressive performances. In this paper, we argue that low-rank constraint, albeit useful, is not effective enough to exploit the local smooth and piecewise priors of visual data. We propose integrating total variation into low-rank tensor completion (LRTC) to address the drawback. As LRTC can be formulated by both tensor unfolding and tensor decomposition, we develop correspondingly two methods, namely LRTC-TV-I and LRTC-TVII, and their iterative solvers.

When input is corrupted, then the standard VAE lower bound involves marginalizing the encoder conditional distribution over the input noise, which makes the training criterion intractable. Instead, we propose a modified training criterion which corresponds to a tractable bound when input is corrupted.

UMC is a cumulative entropy based non-parametric multivariate correlation measure, which can capture both linear and non-linear correlations for groups of three or more variables. It employs a correction for chance using a statistical model of independence to address the issue of bias.

In this way, two affinity matrices and a transformation matrix are iteratively updated until achieving their individual optimum, so that these two affinity matrices are consistent and the intrinsic subspace is learnt via the transformation matrix.

A main challenge in subspace clustering is to quickly calculate a \"good\" affinity matrix. ℓ0, ℓ1, ℓ2 or nuclear norm regularization is used to construct the affinity matrix in many subspace clustering methods because of their theoretical guarantees and empirical success. However, they suffer from the following problems: (1) ℓ2 and nuclear norm regularization require very strong assumptions to guarantee a subspace-preserving affinity; (2) although ℓ1 regularization can be guaranteed to give a subspace-preserving affinity under certain conditions, it needs more time to solve a large-scale convex optimization problem; (3) ℓ0 regularization can yield a tradeoff between computationally efficient and subspace-preserving affinity by using the orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP) algorithm, but this still takes more time to search the solution in OMP when the number of data points is large. In order to overcome these problems, we first propose a learned OMP (LOMP) algorithm to learn a single hidden neural network (SHNN) to fast approximate the ℓ0code. We then exploit a sparse subspace clustering method based on ℓ0 code which is fast computed by SHNN. Two sufficient conditions are presented to guarantee that our method can give a subspace-preserving affinity. Experiments on handwritten digit and face clustering show that our method not only quickly computes the ℓ0 code, but also outperforms the relevant subspace clustering methods in clustering results.

In such applications, queries can be constructed de novo to elicit information (e.g., automated science) or to evade detection with minimal cost (e.g., adversarial reverse engineering). We develop a general framework, called dimension coupling (DC), that 1) reduces a d-dimensional learning problem to d-1 low dimensional sub-problems, 2) solves each sub-problem efficiently, 3) appropriately aggregates the results and outputs a linear classifier, and 4) provides a theoretical guarantee for all possible schemes of aggregation. The proposed method is proved resilient to noise. We show that the DC framework avoids the curse of dimensionality: its computational complexity scales linearly with the dimension. Moreover, we show that the query complexity of DC is near optimal (within a constant factor of the optimum algorithm). To further support our theoretical analysis, we compare the performance of DC with the existing work.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Feature selection is an important technique in machine learning research. An effective and robust feature selection method is desired to simultaneously identify the informative features and eliminate the noisy ones of data. In this paper, we consider the unsupervised feature selection problem which is particularly difficult as there is not any class labels that would guide the search for relevant features. To solve this, we propose a novel algorithmic framework which performs unsupervised feature selection. Firstly, the proposed framework implements structure learning, where the data structures (including intrinsic distribution structure and the data segment) are found via a combination of the alternative optimization and clustering. Then, both the intrinsic data structure and data segmentation are formulated as regularization terms for discriminant feature selection. The results of the feature selection also affect the structure learning step in the following iterations. By leveraging the interactions between structure learning and feature selection, we are able to capture more accurate structure of data and select more informative features. Clustering and classification experiments on real world image data sets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method",

    "title": "Beyond RPCA: Flattening Complex Noise in the Frequency Domain",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Discovering robust low-rank data representations is important in many real-world problems. Traditional robust principal component analysis (RPCA) assumes that the observed data are corrupted by some sparse noise (e.g., Laplacian noise) and utilizes the l1-norm to separate out the noisy compo- nent. Nevertheless, as well as simple Gaussian or Laplacian noise, noise in real-world data is often more complex, and thus the l1 and l2-norms are insufficient for noise charac- terization. This paper presents a more flexible approach to modeling complex noise by investigating their properties in the frequency domain. Although elements of a noise matrix are chaotic in the spatial domain, the absolute values of its alternative coefficients in the frequency domain are constant w.r.t. their variance. Based on this observation, a new robust PCA algorithm is formulated by simultaneously discovering the low-rank and noisy components. Extensive experiments on synthetic data and video background subtraction demon- strate that FRPCA is effective for handles complex noise",

    "title": "Spectral Clustering with Brainstorming Process for Multi-View Data",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Clustering tasks often requires multiple views rather than a singleview to correctly reflect diverse characteristics of the cluster boundaries. The cluster boundaries estimated using a single view are incorrect in general, and those incorrect estimation should be compensated by helps of other views. If each viewis independent to other views, incorrect estimations will be mostly revised as the number of views grow. However, as the number of views grow, it is almost impossibleto avoid dependencies among views, and such dependencies often delude correct estimations. Thus, dependencies among views should be carefully considered in multi-view clustering. This paper proposes a new spectral clustering method to deal with multi-view data and dependencies among views. The proposed method is motivated by the brainstorming process. In the brainstorming process, an instance is regarded as an agenda to be discussed, while each view is considered as a brainstormer. Through the discussion step in the brainstorming process, a brainstormer iteratively suggests their opinions and accepts others' different opinions. To compensate the biases caused by information sharing between brainstormers with dependent opinions, those having independent opinions are more encouraged to discuss together than those with dependent opinions. The conclusion step makes a compromise by merging or concatenating all opinions. The clustering is finally done after the conclusion. Experimental results in three tasks show the effectiveness of the proposed method comparing with ordinary single and multi-view spectral clusterings",

Existing methods assume that the manifold constructed from the data is smooth, but they lack the ability to model skeleton structures from noisy data. To overcome this issue, we propose a novel probabilistic structured learning model to learn the density of latent embedding given high-dimensional data and its neighborhood graph. The embedded points that form a smooth skeleton structure are obtained by maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation. Our analysis shows that the resulting similarity matrix is sparse and unique, and its associated kernel has eigenvalues that follow a power law distribution, which leads to the embeddings of a smooth skeleton. The model is extended to learn a sparse similarity matrix when the graph structure is unknown.

The resulting algorithm seeks a desirable solution to the original problem via solving a sequence of linear programming convex relaxation subproblems. In addition, we prove that the penalty function, induced by adding the complementarity constraint to the objective, is exact, i.e., it has the same local and global minima with those of the original binary program when the penalty parameter is over some threshold. The convergence of the algorithm can be guaranteed, since it essentially reduces to block coordinate descent in the literature.

The second idea consists in adopting the optimism in the face of uncertainty principle and to use upper bound reward estimates. Our method is tested on a navigation task, under four Transfer RL experimental settings: with a known reward function, with strong and weak expert knowledge on the reward function, and with a completely unknown reward function.

Furthermore, for any node of the graph there is a path leading to the unique node providing the maximum expected reward, along which the expected reward is monotonically increasing. Previous results on this setting describe the behavior of frequentist MAB algorithms. In our paper, we design a Thompson Sampling-based algorithm whose asymptotic pseudo-regret matches the lower bound for the considered setting. We show that -as it happens in a wide number of scenarios- Bayesian MAB algorithms dramatically outperform frequentist ones.

First, we compute the pairwise Minimax distances between the objects, using the equivalence of Minimax distances over a graph and over a minimum spanning tree constructed on that. Then, we perform an embedding of the pairwise Minimax distances into a new vector space, such that their squared Euclidean distances in the new space are equal to their Minimax distances in the original space. We also consider the cases where multiple pairwise Minimax matrices are given, instead of a single one.

    "abstract": "Inferring causal relations from observational data is widely used for knowledge discovery in healthcare and economics. To investigate whether a treatment can affect an outcome of interest, we focus on answering counterfactual questions of this type: what would a patient's blood pressure be had he/she received a different treatment? Nearest neighbor matching (NNM) sets the counterfactual outcome of any treatment (control) sample to be equal to the factual outcome of its nearest neighbor in the control (treatment) group. Although being simple, flexible and interpretable, most NNM approaches could be easily misled by variables that do not affect the outcome. In this paper, we address this challenge by learning subspaces that are predictive of the outcome variable for both the treatment group and control group. Applying NNM in the learned subspaces leads to more accurate estimation of the counterfactual outcomes and therefore treatment effects. We introduce an informative subspace learning algorithm by maximizing the nonlinear dependence between the candidate subspace and the outcome variable measured by the Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion (HSIC). We propose a scalable estimator of HSIC, called HSIC-RFF that reduces the quadratic computational and storage complexities (with respect to the sample size) of the naive HSIC implementation to linear through constructing random Fourier features. We also prove an upper bound on the approximation error of the HSIC-RFF estimator. Experimental results on simulated datasets and real-world datasets demonstrate our proposed approach outperforms existing NNM approaches and other commonly used regression-based methods for counterfactual inference",

However, compared to the source domain, the target domain often has limited data in practice. In this case, overfitting may significantly depress transferability, due to the model redundancy of the intensive CNN structures. To deal with this difficulty, we propose a novel sparse deep transfer learning approach for CNN. There are three main contributions in this work. First, we introduce a Sparse-SourceNet to reduce the redundancy in the source domain. Second, we introduce a Hybrid-TransferNet to improve the generalization ability and the prediction accuracy of transfer learning, by taking advantage of both model sparsity and implicit knowledge. Third, we introduce a Sparse-TargetNet, where we prune our Hybrid-TransferNet to obtain a highly-compact, source-knowledge-integrated CNN in the target domain. To examine the effectiveness of our methods, we perform our sparse deep transfer learning approach on a number of benchmark transfer learning tasks. The results show that, compared to the standard fine-tuning approach, our proposed approach achieves a significant pruning rate on CNN while improves the accuracy of transfer learning",

The key implication of our proposed approach is the ability to derive upper bounds on the sample complexity that depend on n/m in place of n. Consequently, even when the number of arms is infinite, we only need a finite number of samples to identify an arm that compares favourably with a fixed reward quantile. This facility makes our approach attractive to applications such as drug discovery, wherein the number of arms (molecular configurations) may run into a few thousands. We present sampling algorithms for both the finite- and infinite-armed cases, and validate their efficiency through theoretical and experimental analysis.We also present a lower bound on the worst case sample complexity of PAC algorithms for our problem, which matches our upper bound up to a logarithmic factor",

The online adaptation is mainly carried out at the end-devices, which requires the adaptation algorithms to be light, efficient and accurate. Previous results focused mainly on efficiency. This paper proposes an novel online model adaptation framework for not only efficiency but also optimal online adaptation. At first, an online optimal incremental simplex tableau (IST)algorithm is proposed, which approaches the model adaption by linear programming and produces the optimized model update in each step when a personalized training data is collected.But keeping online optimal in each step is expensive and may cause over-fitting especially when the online data is noisy. A Fast-IST approach is therefore proposed, which measures the deviation between the training data and the current model. It schedules updating only when enough deviation is detected. The efficiency of each update is further enhanced by running IST only limited iterations, which bounds the computation complexity. Theoretical analysis and extensive evaluations show that Fast-IST saves computation cost greatly, while achieving speedy and accurate model adaptation.It provides better model adaptation speed and accuracy while using even lower computing cost than the state-of-the art",

However, it has limitations when the goal is for generating sequences of discrete tokens. A major reason lies in that the discrete outputs from the generative model make it difficult to pass the gradient update from the discriminative model to the generative model. Also, the discriminative model can only assess a complete sequence, while for a partially generated sequence, it is non-trivial to balance its current score and the future one once the entire sequence has been generated. In this paper, we propose a sequence generation framework, called SeqGAN, to solve the problems. Modeling the data generator as a stochastic policy in reinforcement learning (RL), SeqGAN bypasses the generator differentiation problem by directly performing gradient policy update. The RL reward signal comes from the GAN discriminator judged on a complete sequence, and is passed back to the intermediate state-action steps using Monte Carlo search.

    "abstract": "Link prediction is a fundamental task in such areas as social network analysis, information retrieval, and bioinformatics. Usually link prediction methods use the link structures or node attributes as the sources of information. Recently, the relational topic model (RTM) and its variants have been proposed as hybrid methods that jointly model both sources of information and achieve very promising accuracy. However, the representations (features) learned by them are still not effective enough to represent the nodes (items). To address this problem, we generalize recent advances in deep learning from solely modeling i.i.d. sequences of attributes to jointly modeling graphs and non-i.i.d. sequences of attributes. Specifically, we follow the Bayesian deep learning framework and devise a hierarchical Bayesian model, called relational deep learning (RDL), to jointly model high-dimensional node attributes and link structures with layers of latent variables. Due to the multiple nonlinear transformations in RDL, standard variational inference is not applicable. We propose to utilize the product of Gaussians (PoG) structure in RDL to relate the inferences on different variables and derive a generalized variational inference algorithm for learning the variables and predicting the links. Experiments on three real-world datasets show that RDL works surprisingly well and significantly outperforms the state of the art",

The DyBM, however, is defined only for binary valued data, without any nonlinear hidden units. Here, in our first contribution, we extend the DyBM to deal with real valued data. We present a formulation called Gaussian DyBM, that can be seen as an extension of a vector autoregressive (VAR) model. This uses, in addition to standard (explanatory) variables, components that captures long term dependencies in the time series. In our second contribution, we extend the Gaussian DyBM model with a recurrent neural network (RNN) that controls the bias input to the DyBM units. We derive a stochastic gradient update rule such that, the output weights from the RNN can also be trained online along with other DyBM parameters. Furthermore, this acts as nonlinear hidden layer extending the capacity of DyBM and allows it to model nonlinear components in a given time-series. Numerical experiments with synthetic datasets show that the RNN-Gaussian DyBM improves predictive accuracy upon standard VAR by up to 35%. On real multi-dimensional time-series prediction, consisting of high nonlinearity and non-stationarity, we demonstrate that this nonlinear DyBM model achieves significant improvement upon state of the art baseline methods like VAR and long short-term memory (LSTM) networks at a reduced computational cost",

    "title": "Tunable Sensitivity to Large Errors in Neural Network Training",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "When humans learn a new concept, they might ignore examples that they cannot make sense of at first, and only later focus on such examples, when they are more useful for learning. We propose incorporating this idea of tunable sensitivity for hard examples in neural network learning, using a new generalization of the cross-entropy gradient step, which can be used in place of the gradient in any gradient-based training method. The generalized gradient is parameterized by a value that controls the sensitivity of the training process to harder training examples. We tested our method on several benchmark datasets. We propose, and corroborate in our experiments, that the optimal level of sensitivity to hard example is positively correlated with the depth of the network. Moreover, the test prediction error obtained by our method is generally lower than that of the vanilla cross-entropy gradient learner. We therefore conclude that tunable sensitivity can be helpful for neural network learning",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "When learning from instances whose output labels may be partial, the problem of knowing which of these output labels should be made precise to improve the accuracy of predictions arises. This problem can be seen as the intersection of two tasks: the one of learning from partial labels and the one of active learning, where the goal is to provide the labels of additional instances to improve the model accuracy. In this paper, we propose querying strategies of partial labels for the well-known K-nn classifier. We propose different criteria of increasing complexity, using among other things the amount of ambiguity that partial labels introduce in the K-nn decision rule. We then show that our strategies usually outperform simple baseline schemes, and that more complex strategies provide a faster improvement of the model accuracies",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Self-paced learning (SPL) mimics the cognitive mechanism of humans and animals that gradually learns from easy to hard samples. One key issue in SPL is to obtain better weighting strategy that is determined by the minimizer function. Existing methods usually pursue this by artificially designing the explicit form of SPL regularizer. In this paper, we study a group of new regularizer (named self-paced implicit regularizer) that is deduced from robust loss function. Based on the convex conjugacy theory, the minimizer function for self-paced implicit regularizer can be directly learned from the latent loss function, while the analytic form of the regularizer can be even unknown. A general framework (named SPL-IR) for SPL is developed accordingly. We demonstrate that the learning procedure of SPL-IR is associated with latent robust loss functions, thus can provide some theoretical insights for its working mechanism. We further analyze the relation between SPL-IR and half-quadratic optimization and provide a group of self-paced implicit regularizer. Finally, we implement SPL-IR to both supervised and unsupervised tasks, and experimental results corroborate our ideas and demonstrate the correctness and effectiveness of implicit regularizers",

    "abstract": "Policy gradient methods have been widely applied in reinforcement learning. For reasons of safety and cost, learning is often conducted using a simulator. However, learning in simulation does not traditionally utilise the opportunity to improve learning by adjusting certain environment variables - state features that are randomly determined by the environment in a physical setting but controllable in a simulator. Exploiting environment variables is crucial in domains containing significant rare events (SREs), e.g., unusual wind conditions that can crash a helicopter, which are rarely observed under random sampling but have a considerable impact on expected return. We propose off environment reinforcement learning (OFFER), which addresses such cases by simultaneously optimising the policy and a proposal distribution over environment variables. We prove that OFFER converges to a locally optimal policy and show experimentally that it learns better and faster than a policy gradient baseline",

    "abstract": "Recently the auto-encoder and its variants have demonstrated their promising results in extracting effective features. Specifically, its basic idea of encouraging the output to be as similar as input, ensures the learned representation could faithfully reconstruct the input data. However, one problem arises that not all hidden units are useful to compress the discriminative information while lots of units mainly contribute to represent the task-irrelevant patterns. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm, Feature Selection Guided Auto-Encoder, which is a unified generative model that integrates feature selection and auto-encoder together. To this end, our proposed algorithm can distinguish the task-relevant units from the task-irrelevant ones to obtain most effective features for future classification tasks. Our model not only performs feature selection on learned high-level features, but also dynamically endows the auto-encoder to produce more discriminative units.

We use the technique of matrix completion in the presence of side information to develop the Inductive Pairwise Ranking (IPR) algorithm that provably learns a good ranking under the FLR model, in a sample-efficient manner. In practice, through systematic synthetic simulations, we confirm our theoretical findings regarding improvements in the sample complexity due to the use of feature information. Moreover, on popular real-world preference learning datasets, with as less as 10% sampling of the pairwise comparisons, our method recovers a good ranking",

Despite that the fact that both top-k classification and hierarchical classification have gained increasing interests, the two problems have always been studied separately. In this paper, we define a top-k hierarchical loss function using a real world application.

The discovery promotes us to seek low-rank and doubly stochastic similarity matrix, we then propose an unsupervised linear dimensionality reduction method, called Unsupervised Large Graph Embedding (ULGE). ULGE starts with similar idea as LPP, it adopts an efficient approach to construct similarity matrix and then performs spectral analysis efficiently, the computational complexity can reduce to O(ndm), which is a significant improvement compared to conventional spectral based methods which need O(n^2d) at least, where n, d and m are the number of samples, dimensions and anchors, respectively.

Specifically, we impose a bipartite structure on the GGM and govern the hidden variables by truncated normal distributions. The nonlinearity of the model is revealed by its connection to rectified linear unit (ReLU) neural networks. Meanwhile, thanks to the bipartite structure and appealing properties of truncated normals, we are able to train the models efficiently using contrastive divergence. We consider three output constructs, accounting for real-valued, binary and count data. We further extend the model to deep constructions and show that deep models can be used for unsupervised pre-training of rectifier neural networks.

This paper proposes a novel algorithm RIST that exploits the algebraic variety of low-rank manifold for matrix recovery. Particularly, RIST utilizes an efficient scheme that automatically estimate the potential rank on the real algebraic variety and tracks the favorable Riemannian submanifold. Moreover, RIST utilizes the second-order geometric characterization and achieves provable superlinear convergence, which is superior to the linear convergence of most existing methods.

However, existing bilinear PCCAs impose restrictive model assumptions for matrix structure preservation, sacrificing generative correctness or model flexibility. To overcome these drawbacks, we propose BPCCA, a new bilinear extension of PCCA, by introducing a hybrid joint model. Our new model preserves matrix structures indirectly via hybrid vector-based and matrix-based concatenations. This enables BPCCA to gain more model flexibility in capturing two-view correlations and obtain close-form solutions in parameter estimation.

We propose an efficient Matching Pursuit Generalized LASSO (MPGL) method, which overcomes these issues, and is guaranteed to converge to a global optimum. We formulate the GL problem as a convex quadratic constrained linear programming (QCLP) problem and tailor-make a cutting plane method. More specifically, our MPGL iteratively activates a subset of nonzero elements of the transformed variables, and solves a subproblem involving only the activated elements thus gaining significant speed-up. Moreover, MPGL is less sensitive to the choice of the trade-off hyper-parameter between data fitting and regularization, and mitigates the long-standing hyper-parameter tuning issue in many existing methods.

In this paper, we formulate and address the problem of informed discovery of unknown unknowns of any given predictive model where unknown unknowns occur due to systematic biases in the training data.We propose a model-agnostic methodology which uses feedback from an oracle to both identify unknown unknowns and to intelligently guide the discovery. We employ a two-phase approach which first organizes the data into multiple partitions based on the feature similarity of instances and the confidence scores assigned by the predictive model, and then utilizes an explore-exploit strategy for discovering unknown unknowns across these partitions.

To deal with such problem, a method called Label Distribution Learning (LDL) was proposed to utilize the neighboring ages while learning a particular age. Later, an adaptive version of LDL called ALDL was proposed to generate a proper label distribution for each age. However, the adaptation process requires more training data, which creates a dilemma between the performance of ALDL and the training data. In this paper, we propose an algorithm called Semi-supervised Adaptive Label Distribution Learning (SALDL) to solve the dilemma and improve the performance using unlabeled data for facial age estimation. On the one hand, the utilization of unlabeled data helps to improve the adaptation process. On the other hand, the adapted label distributions conversely reinforce the semi-supervised process. As a result, they can promote each other to get better performance.

In consequence, it demands constructing a large number of features to attain the desired accuracy for downstream use. In this paper, we present a novel sampling algorithm powered by moment matching techniques to reduce the variance of random features.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "In this paper, we study a novel transfer learning problem termed Distant Domain Transfer Learning (DDTL). Different from existing transfer learning problems which assume that there is a close relation between the source domain and the target domain, in the DDTL problem, the target domain can be totally different from the source domain. For example, the source domain classifies face images but the target domain distinguishes plane images. Inspired by the cognitive processof human where two seemingly unrelated concepts can be connected by learning intermediate concepts gradually, we propose a Selective Learning Algorithm (SLA) to solve the DDTL problem with supervised autoencoder or supervised convolutional autoencoder as a base model for handling different types of inputs. Intuitively, the SLA algorithm selects usefully unlabeled data gradually from intermediate domains as a bridge to break the large distribution gap for transferring knowledge between two distant domains. Empirical studies on image classification problems demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, and on some tasks the improvement in terms of the classification accuracy is up to 17% over \"non-transfer\" methods",

    "abstract": "Advances in deep reinforcement learning have allowed autonomous agents to perform well on Atari games, often outperforming humans, using only raw pixels to make their decisions. However, most of these games take place in 2D environments that are fully observable to the agent. In this paper, we present the first architecture to tackle 3D environments in first-person shooter games, that involve partially observable states. Typically, deep reinforcement learning methods only utilize visual input for training. We present a method to augment these models to exploit game feature information such as the presence of enemies or items, during the training phase. Our model is trained to simultaneously learn these features along with minimizing a Q-learning objective, which is shown to dramatically improve the training speed and performance of our agent. Our architecture is also modularized to allow different models to be independently trained for different phases of the game. We show that the proposed architecture substantially outperforms built-in AI agents of the game as well as average humans in deathmatch scenarios",

BayCDR uses a latent space to measure the correlation between different domains, and learns the ranking functions from the interrelated domains via the latent space by a Bayesian model, where each ranking function is based on a weighted average model. An efficient learning algorithm based on variational inference and a generalization bound has been developed. To scale up to handle real large data, we also present a learning algorithm under the Map-Reduce programming model.

Least square methods make the best use of available data directly computing the TD solution and thus do not require tuning a typically highly sensitive learning rate parameter, but require quadratic computation and storage. Recent algorithmic developments have yielded several sub-quadratic methods that use an approximation to the least squares TD solution, but incur bias. In this paper, we propose a new family of accelerated gradient TD (ATD) methods that (1) provide similar data efficiency benefits to least-squares methods, at a fraction of the computation and storage (2) significantly reduce parameter sensitivity compared to linear TD methods, and (3) are asymptotically unbiased. We illustrate these claims with a proof of convergence in expectation and experiments on several benchmark domains and a large-scale industrial energy allocation domain",

The proposed model alleviates this deterioration in performance without additional data by modeling the non-linear dynamics of the decision boundary using Gaussian processes.

However, there exists two major bottlenecks: (1) directly learning discrete hashing codes is an NP-hardoptimization problem; (2) the complexity of both storage and computational time to build a graph with n data points is O(n2). To address these two problems, in this paper, we propose a novel yetsimple supervised graph based hashing method, asymmetric discrete graph hashing, by preserving the asymmetric discrete constraint and building an asymmetric affinity matrix to learn compact binary codes.Specifically, we utilize two different instead of identical discrete matrices to better preserve the similarity of the graph with short binary codes. We generate the asymmetric affinity matrix using m (m << n) selected anchors to approximate the similarity among all training data so that computational time and storage requirement can be significantly improved. In addition, the proposed method jointly learns discrete binary codes and a low-dimensional projection matrix to further improve the retrieval accuracy. Extensive experiments on three benchmark large-scale databases demonstrate its superior performance over the recent state of the arts with lower training time costs",

These methods include: (1) Approximating the normalized document-word conditional distribution with the documents probability matrix and words probability matrix based on probabilistic non-negative matrix factorization (NMF); (2) Since the standard NMF is well known to be non-robust to noises and outliers, we extended the probabilistic NMF of the topic model to its robust versions using l21-norm and capped l21-norm based loss functions, respectively.

In this paper, we propose computationally efficient algorithms for SIM inference in high dimensions with structural constraints.

    "abstract": "A challenge for mining large-scale streaming data overlooked by most existing studies on online learning is the skewdistribution of examples over different classes. Many previous works have considered cost-sensitive approaches in an online setting for streaming data, where fixed costs are assigned to different classes, or ad-hoc costs are adapted based on the distribution of data received so far. However, it is not necessary for them to achieve optimal performance in terms of the measures suited for imbalanced data, such as Fmeasure, area under ROC curve (AUROC), area under precision and recall curve (AUPRC). This work proposes a general framework for online learning with imbalanced streaming data, where examples are coming sequentially and models are updated accordingly on-the-fly. By simultaneously learning multiple classifiers with different cost vectors, the proposed method can be adopted for different target measures for imbalanced data, including F-measure, AUROC and AUPRC. Moreover, we present a rigorous theoretical justification of the proposed framework for the F-measure maximization. Our empirical studies demonstrate the competitive if not better performance of the proposed method compared to previous cost-sensitive and resampling based online learning algorithms and those that are designed for optimizing certain measures",

To address for this, we employ an algorithm for SVM classification using indefinite kernels. We also present a graph kernel based on the Pyramid Match kernel that finds an approximate correspondence between the sets of vectors of the two graphs. We further improve the proposed kernel using the Weisfeiler-Lehman framework.

However, how to improve the representation capability and discriminability of multi-kernel dictionary has not been well studied. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-kernel DL approach, named multi-kernel low-rank dictionary pair learning (MKLDPL).

The learned synthesis and analysis dictionaries work together to implement the coding and reconstruction of samples in the kernel space. To enhance the discriminability of the learned multi-kernel dictionaries, MKLDPL imposes the low-rank regularization on the analysis dictionary, which can make samples from the same class have similar representations. We apply MKLDPL for multiple features based image classification task. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach",

However, the best known convergence rate for general convex problems is O(1/T) as opposed to O(1/T2) of accelerated batch algorithms, where T is the number of iterations. Thus, there still remains a gap in convergence rates between existing stochastic ADMM and batch algorithms. To bridge this gap, we introduce the momentum acceleration trick for batch optimization into the stochastic variance reduced gradient based ADMM (SVRG-ADMM), which leads to an accelerated (ASVRG-ADMM) method. Then we design two different momentum term update rules for strongly convex and general convex cases. We prove that ASVRG-ADMM converges linearly for strongly convex problems. Besides having a low-iteration complexity as existing stochastic ADMM methods, ASVRG-ADMM improves the convergence rate on general convex problems from O(1/T) to O(1/T2).

Previously, oblivious random projection based approaches that project high dimensional features onto a random subspace have been used in practice for tackling high-dimensionality challenge in machine learning. Recently, various non-oblivious randomized reduction methods have been developed and deployed for solving many numerical problems such as matrix product approximation, low-rank matrix approximation, etc. However, they are less explored for the machine learning tasks, e.g., classification. More seriously, the theoretical analysis of excess risk bounds for risk minimization, an important measure of generalization performance, has not been established for non-oblivious randomized reduction methods. It therefore remains an open problem what is the benefit of using them over previous oblivious random projection based approaches. To tackle these challenges, we propose an algorithmic framework for employing non-oblivious randomized reduction method for general empirical risk minimizing in machine learning tasks, where the original high-dimensional features are projected onto a random subspace that is derived from the data with a small matrix approximation error. We then derive the first excess risk bound for the proposed non-oblivious randomized reduction approach without requiring strong assumptions on the training data. The established excess risk bound exhibits that the proposed approach provides much better generalization performance and it also sheds more insights about different randomized reduction approaches. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world benchmark datasets, whose dimension scales to O(10^7), to demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed approach",

The proposed Scalable Low-Rank Hawkes Process (SLRHP) framework introduces a low-rank approximation of the kernel matrix that allows to perform the nonparametric learning of the d2 triggering kernels in at most O(ndr2) operations, where r is the rank of the approximation (r ≪ d, n). This comes as a major improvement to the existing state-of-the-art inference algorithms that require O(nd2) operations. Furthermore, the low-rank approximation allows SLRHP to learn representative patterns of interaction between event types, which is usually valuable for the analysis of complex processes in real-world networks",

We show how standard fixed-estimate predictors fit within a probabilistic framework, and suggest the reason they work for certain classes of behaviors and not others. We quantify the degree of mismatch and offer alternative sampling-based modeling techniques. We are specifically interested in building executable models (as opposed to statistical or descriptive models) because we want to reproduce and study multiagent behavior in simulation. Such models can be used by biologists, sociologists, and economists to explain and predict individual and group behavior in novel scenarios, and to test hypotheses regarding group behavior. Developing models from observation of real systems is an obvious application of machine learning. Learning directly from data eliminates expensive hand processing and tuning, but introduces unique challenges that violate certain assumptions common in standard machine learning approaches. Our framework suggests a new class of sampling-based methods, which we implement and apply to simulated deterministic and stochastic schooling behaviors, as well as the observed schooling behavior of real fish. Experimental results show that our implementation performs comparably with standard learning techniques for deterministic behaviors, and better on stochastic behaviors",

Hallucinated Replay (Talvitie 2014) trains the model to \"correct\" itself when it produces errors, substantially improving MBRL with flawed models. This paper theoretically analyzes this approach, illuminates settings in which it is likely to be effective or ineffective, and presents a novel error bound, showing that a model's ability to self-correct is more tightly related to MBRL performance than one-step prediction error.

We propose to jointly learn binary codes and clusters within one framework.

However similarity measurement is challenging because it is usually impacted by many factors, e.g., the choice of similarity metric, neighborhood size, scale of data, noise and outliers. Thus the learned similarity matrix is often not suitable, let alone optimal, for the subsequent clustering. In addition, nonlinear similarity often exists in many real world data which, however, has not been effectively considered by most existing methods. To tackle these two challenges, we propose a model to simultaneously learn cluster indicator matrix and similarity information in kernel spaces in a principled way. We show theoretical relationships to kernel k-means, k-means, and spectral clustering methods. Then, to address the practical issue of how to select the most suitable kernel for a particular clustering task, we further extend our model with a multiple kernel learning ability. With this joint model, we can automatically accomplish three subtasks of finding the best cluster indicator matrix, the most accurate similarity relations and the optimal combination of multiple kernels. By leveraging the interactions between these three subtasks in a joint framework, each subtask can be iteratively boosted by using the results of the others towards an overall optimal solution.

We show that metric properties known for Sinkhorn-Cuturi generalize to TROT, and provide efficient algorithms for finding the optimal transportation plan with formal convergence proofs. We also present the first application of optimal transport to the problem of ecological inference, that is, the reconstruction of joint distributions from their marginals, a problem of large interest in the social sciences. TROT provides a convenient framework for ecological inference by allowing to compute the joint distribution -— that is, the optimal transportation plan itself — when side information is available, which is e.g. typically what census represents in political science. Experiments on data from the 2012 US presidential elections display the potential of TROT in delivering a faithful reconstruction of the joint distribution of ethnic groups and voter preferences",

It is helpful to reduce the time cost, data amount, and expertise required. Deep learning has achieved great success in various tasks involving images, voices and videos. There are several studies have the sense of model reuse, by trying to reuse pre-trained deep networks architectures or deep model features to train a new deep model. They, however, neglect the fact that there are many other fixed models or features available. In this paper, we propose a more thorough model reuse scheme, FMR (Fixed Model Reuse). FMR utilizes the learning power of deep models to implicitly grab the useful discriminative information from fixed model/features that have been widely used in general tasks. We firstly arrange the convolution layers of a deep network and the provided fixed model/features in parallel, fully connecting to the output layer nodes. Then, the dependencies between the output layer nodes and the fixed model/features are knockdown such that only the raw feature inputs are needed when the model is being used for testing, though the helpful information in the fixed model/features have already been incorporated into the model. On one hand, by the FMR scheme, the required amount of training data can be significantly reduced because of the reuse of fixed model/features. On the other hand, the fixed model/features are not explicitly used in testing, and thus, the scheme can be quite useful in applications where the fixed model/features are protected by patents or commercial secrets. Experiments on five real-world datasets validate the effectiveness of FMR compared with state-of-the-art deep methods",

We cast it as a geometric projection issue with an efficient algorithm. Furthermore, we show that the proposal is provably safe and has already achieved the maximal performance gain, if the ground-truth label assignment is realized by a convex linear combination of base regressors.

    "abstract": "One way to approach end-to-end autonomous driving is to learn a policy that maps from a sensory input, such as an image frame from a front-facing camera, to a driving action, by imitating an expert driver, or a reference policy. This can be done by supervised learning, where a policy is tuned to minimize the difference between the predicted and ground-truth actions. A policy trained in this way however is known to suffer from unexpected behaviours due to the mismatch between the states reachable by the reference policy and trained policy. More advanced algorithms for imitation learning, such as DAgger, addresses this issue by iteratively collecting training examples from both reference and trained policies. These algorithms often require a large number of queries to a reference policy, which is undesirable as the reference policy is often expensive. In this paper, we propose an extension of the DAgger, called SafeDAgger, that is query-efficient and more suitable for end-to-end autonomous driving. We evaluate the proposed SafeDAgger in a car racing simulator and show that it indeed requires less queries to a reference policy.

Our technical contributions in this paper are two-folds: 1) deep network optimization is often achieved by gradient propagation, which critically requires a smooth objective function. The discrete nature of hash codes makes them not amenable for gradient-based optimization. To address this issue, we propose an exponentiated hashing loss function and its bilinear smooth approximation. Effective gradient calculation and propagation are thereby enabled; 2) pre-training is an important trick in supervised deep learning. The impact of pre-training on the hash code quality has never been discussed in current deep hashing literature.

    "abstract": "We introduce a novel supervised metric learning algorithm named parameter free large margin nearest neighbor (PFLMNN) which can be seen as an improvement of the classical large margin nearest neighbor (LMNN) algorithm. The contributions of our work consist of two aspects. First, our method discards the costterm which shrinks the distances between inquiry input and its k target neighbors (the k nearest neighbors with same labels as inquiry input) in LMNN, and only focuses on improving the action to push the imposters (the samples with different labels form the inquiry input) apart out of the neighborhood of inquiry. As a result, our method does not have the parameter needed to tune on the validating set, which makes it more convenient to use. Second, by leveraging the geometry information of the imposters, we construct a novel cost function to penalize the smalldistances between each inquiry and its imposters. Different from LMNN considering every imposter located in the neighborhood of each inquiry, our method only takes care of the nearest imposters. Because when the nearest imposter is pushed out of the neighborhood of its inquiry, other imposters would be all out. In this way, the constraints in our model are much less than that of LMNN, which makes our method much easier to find the optimal distance metric. Consequently, our method not only learns a better distance metric than LMNN, but also runs faster than LMNN. Extensive experiments on different data sets with various sizes and difficulties are conducted, and the results have shown that, compared with LMNN, PFLMNN achieves better classification results",

We answer this question through a careful analysis of previous work on BinaryNets, in terms of training strategies, regularization, and activation approximation. Our findings first reveal that a low learning rate is highly preferred to avoid frequent sign changes of the weights, which often makes the learning of BinaryNets unstable. Secondly, we propose to use PReLU instead of ReLU in a BinaryNet to conveniently absorb the scale factor for weights to the activation function, which enjoys high computation efficiency for binarized layers while maintains high approximation accuracy. Thirdly, we reveal that instead of imposing L2 regularization, driving all weights to zero which contradicts with the setting of BinaryNets, we introduce a regularization term that encourages the weights to be bipolar. Fourthly, we discover that the failure of binarizing the last layer, which is essential for high compression rate, is due to the improper output range. We propose to use a scale layer to bring it to normal. Last but not least, we propose multiple binarizations to improve the approximation of the activations. The composition of all these enables us to train BinaryNets with both high compression rate and high accuracy, which is strongly supported by our extensive empirical study",

    "abstract": "In many applications such as recommender systems and multi-label learning the task is to complete a partially observed binary matrix. Such PU learning (positive-unlabeled) problems can be solved by one-class matrix factorization (MF). In practice side information such as user or item features in recommender systems are often available besides the observed positive user-item connections. In this work we consider a generalization of one-class MF so that two types of side information are incorporated and a general convex loss function can be used. The resulting optimization problem is very challenging, but we derive an efficient and effective alternating minimization procedure. Experiments on large-scale multi-label learning and one-class recommender systems demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "With the better availability of healthcare data, such as Electronic Health Records (EHR), more and more data analytics methodologies are developed aiming at digging insights from them to improve the quality of care delivery. There are many challenges on analyzing EHR, such as high dimensionality and event sparsity. Moreover, different from other application domains, the EHR analysis algorithms need to be highly interpretable to make them clinically useful. This makes representation learning from EHRs of key importance. In this paper, we propose an algorithm called Predictive Task Guided Tensor Decomposition (TaGiTeD), to analyze EHRs. Specifically, TaGiTeD learns event interaction patterns that are highly predictive for certain tasks from EHRs with supervised tensor decomposition. Compared with unsupervised methods, TaGiTeD can learn effective EHR representations in a more focused way. This is crucial because most of the medical problems have very limited patient samples, which are not enough for unsupervised algorithms to learn meaningful representations form. We apply TaGiTeD on real world EHR data warehouse and demonstrate that TaGiTeD can learn representations that are both interpretable and predictive",

    "abstract": "Autonomous systems can be used to search for sparse signals in a large space; e.g., aerial robots can be deployed to localize threats, detect gas leaks, or respond to distress calls. Intuitively, search algorithms may increase efficiency by collecting aggregate measurements summarizing large contiguous regions. However, most existing search methods either ignore the possibility of such region observations (e.g., Bayesian optimization and multi-armed bandits) or make strong assumptions about the sensing mechanism that allow each measurement to arbitrarily encode all signals in the entire environment (e.g., compressive sensing). We propose an algorithm that actively collects data to search for sparse signals using only noisy measurements of the average values on rectangular regions (including single points), based on the greedy maximization of information gain. We analyze our algorithm in 1d and show that it requires $\\tilde{O}(\\frac{n}{\\mu^2}+k^2)$ measurements to recover all of $k$ signal locations with small Bayes error, where $\\mu$ and $n$ are the signal strength and the size of the search space, respectively. We also show that active designs can be fundamentally more efficient than passive designs with region sensing, contrasting with the results of Arias-Castro, Candes, and Davenport (2013).

However, despite recent advances in deep learning and the successes of recurrent neural networks (RNNs), researchers have only just recently begun to study how to apply RNNs to heterogeneous graph and network datasets. There has been recent work on using RNNs for unsupervised learning in networks (e.g., graph clustering, node embedding) and for prediction (e.g., link prediction, graph classification), but there has been little work on using RNNs for node-based relational classification tasks. In this paper, we provide an end-to-end learning framework using RNNs for collective inference. Our main insight is to transform a node and its set of neighbors into an unordered sequence (of varying length) and use an LSTM-based RNN to predict the class label as the output of that sequence. We develop a collective inference method, which we refer to as Deep Collective Inference (DCI), that uses semi-supervised learning in partially-labeled networks and two label distribution correction mechanisms for imbalanced classes. We compare to several alternative methods on seven network datasets. DCI achieves up to a 12% reduction in error compared to the best alternative and a 25% reduction in error on average — over all methods, for all label proportions",

    "abstract": "Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have demonstrated state-of-the-art performance on many visual recognition tasks. However, the combination of convolution and pooling operations only shows invariance to small local location changes in meaningful objects in input. Sometimes, such networks are trained using data augmentation to encode this invariance into the parameters, which restricts the capacity of the model to learn the content of these objects. A more efficient use of the parameter budget is to encode rotation or translation invariance into the model architecture, which relieves the model from the need to learn them. To enable the model to focus on learning the content of objects other than their locations, we propose to conduct patch ranking of the feature maps before feeding them into the next layer. When patch ranking is combined with convolution and pooling operations, we obtain consistent representations despite the location of meaningful objects in input. We show that the patch ranking module improves the performance of the CNN on many benchmark tasks, including MNIST digit recognition, large-scale image recognition, and image retrieval",

    "abstract": "Faced with the requirements of huge amounts of data processing nowadays, hashing techniques have attracted much attention due to their efficient storage and searching ability. Among these techniques, the ones based on spectral graph show remarkable performance as they could embed the data on a low-dimensional manifold and maintain the neighborhood structure via a non-linear spectral eigenmap. However, the spectral solution in real value of such methods may deviate from the discrete solution. The common practice is just performing a simple rounding operation to obtain the final binary codes, which could break constraints and even result in worse condition. In this paper, we propose to impose a so-called spectral rotation technique to the spectral hashing objective, which could transform the candidate solution into a new one that better approximates the discrete one. Moreover, the binary codes are obtained from the modified solution via minimizing the Euclidean distance, which could result in more semantical correlation within the manifold, where the constraints for codes are always held. We provide an efficient alternative algorithm to solve the above problems. And a manifold learning perceptive for motivating the proposed method is also shown.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "We study the infinitely many-armed bandit problem with budget constraints, where the number of arms can be infinite and much larger than the number of possible experiments. The player aims at maximizing his/her total expected reward under a budget constraint B for the cost of pulling arms. We introduce a weak stochastic assumption on the ratio of expected-reward to expected-cost of a newly pulled arm which characterizes its probability of being a near-optimal arm. We propose an algorithm named RCB-I to this new problem, in which the player first randomly picks K arms, whose order is sub-linear in terms of B, and then runs the algorithm for the finite-arm setting on the selected arms. Theoretical analysis shows that this simple algorithm enjoys a sub-linear regret in term of the budget B. We also provide a lower bound of any algorithm under Bernoulli setting. The regret bound of RCB-I matches the lower bound up to a logarithmic factor. We further extend this algorithm to the any-budget setting (i.e., the budget is unknown in advance) and conduct corresponding theoretical analysis",

    "title": "Binary Embedding with Additive Homogeneous Kernels",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Binary embedding transforms vectors in Euclidean space into the vertices of Hamming space such that Hamming distance between binary codes reflects a particular distance metric. In machine learning, the similarity metrics induced by Mercer kernels are frequently used, leading to the development of binary embedding with Mercer kernels (BE-MK) where the approximate nearest neighbor search is performed in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS). Kernelized locality-sensitive hashing (KLSH), which is one of the representative BE-MK, uses kernel PCA to embed data points into a Euclidean space, followed by the random hyperplane binary embedding. In general, it works well when the query and data points in the database follow the same probability distribution. The streaming data environment, however, continuously requires KLSH to update the leading eigenvectors of the Gram matrix, which can be costly or hard to carry out in practice. In this paper we present a completely randomized binary embedding to work with a family of additive homogeneous kernels, referred to as BE-AHK. The proposed algorithm is easy to implement, built on Vedaldi and Zisserman's work on explicit feature maps for additive homogeneous kernels. We show that our BE-AHK is able to preserve kernel values by developing an upper- and lower-bound on its Hamming distance, which guarantees to solve approximate nearest neighbor search efficiently. Numerical experiments demonstrate that BE-AHK actually yields similarity-preserving binary codes in terms of additive homogeneous kernels and is superior to existing methods in case that training data and queries are generated from different distributions. Moreover, in cases where a large code size is allowed, the performance of BE-AHK is comparable to that of KLSH in general cases",

    "abstract": "Contextual bandits with linear payoffs, which are also known as linear bandits, provide a powerful alternative for solving practical problems of sequential decisions, e.g., online advertisements. In the era of big data, contextual data usually tend to be high-dimensional, which leads to new challenges for traditional linear bandits mostly designed for the setting of low-dimensional contextual data. Due to the curse of dimensionality, there are two challenges in most of the current bandit algorithms: the first is high time-complexity; and the second is extreme large upper regret bounds with high-dimensional data. In this paper, in order to attack the above two challenges effectively, we develop an algorithm of Contextual Bandits via RAndom Projection (CBRAP) in the setting of linear payoffs, which works especially for high-dimensional contextual data. The proposed CBRAP algorithm is time-efficient and flexible, because it enables players to choose an arm in a low-dimensional space, and relaxes the sparsity assumption of constant number of non-zero components in previous work. Besides, we prove an upper regret bound for the proposed algorithm, which is associated with reduced dimensions. By comparing with three benchmark algorithms, we demonstrate improved performance on cumulative payoffs of CBRAP during its sequential decisions on both synthetic and real-world datasets, as well as its superior time-efficiency",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Indefinite kernel support vector machine (IKSVM) has recently attracted increasing attentions in machine learning. Different from traditional SVMs, IKSVM essentially is a non-convex optimization problem. Some algorithms directly change the spectrum of the indefinite kernel matrix at the cost of losing some valuable information involved in the kernels so as to transform the non-convex problem into a convex one. Other algorithms aim to solve the dual form of IKSVM, but suffer from the dual gap between the primal and dual problems in the case of indefinite kernels. In this paper, we directly focus on the non-convex primal form of IKSVM and propose a novel algorithm termed as IKSVM-DC. According to the characteristics of the spectrum for the indefinite kernel matrix, IKSVM-DC decomposes the objective function into the subtraction of two convex functions and thus reformulates the primal problem as a difference of convex functions (DC) programming which can be optimized by the DC algorithm (DCA). In order to accelerate convergence rate, IKSVM-DC further combines the classical DCA with a line search step along the descent direction at each iteration. A theoretical analysis is then presented to validate that IKSVM-DC can converge to a local minimum. Systematical experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of IKSVM-DC compared to state-of-the-art IKSVM related algorithms",

Based on computer experiments they have conjectured that AL* produces residual AFAs, but have not been able to give a proof. In this paper we disprove this conjecture by constructing a counterexample.

    "abstract": "Independent Component Analysis (ICA) is the problem of learning a square matrix A, given samples of X = AS, where S is a random vector with independent coordinates. Most existing algorithms are provably efficient only when each Si has finite and moderately valued fourth moment. However, there are practical applications where this assumption need not be true, such as speech and finance. Algorithms have been proposed for heavy-tailed ICA, but they are not practical, using random walks and the full power of the ellipsoid algorithm multiple times. The main contributions of this paper are (1) A practical algorithm for heavy-tailed ICA that we call HTICA. We provide theoretical guarantees and show that it outperforms other algorithms in some heavy-tailed regimes, both on real and synthetic data. Like the current state-of-the-art, the new algorithm is based on the centroid body (a first moment analogue of the covariance matrix). Unlike the state-of-the-art, our algorithm is practically efficient. To achieve this, we use explicit analytic representations of the centroid body, which bypasses the use of the ellipsoid method and random walks. (2) We study how heavy tails affect different ICA algorithms, including HTICA. Somewhat surprisingly, we show that some algorithms that use the covariance matrix or higher moments can successfully solve a range of ICA instances with infinite second moment. We study this theoretically and experimentally, with both synthetic and real-world heavy-tailed data",

Specifically, we perform multiple kernel clustering directly with the presence of incomplete kernels, which are treated as auxiliary variables to be jointly optimized. Our algorithm does not require that there be at least one complete base kernel over all the samples. Also, it adaptively imputes incomplete kernels and combines them to best serve clustering. A three-step iterative algorithm with proved convergence is designed to solve the resultant optimization problem. Extensive experiments are conducted on four benchmark data sets to compare the proposed algorithm with existing imputation-based methods.

Deep networks are learned using huge training data where the problem of noisy labels is particularly relevant. The current techniques proposed for learning deep networks under label noise focus on modifying the network architecture and on algorithms for estimating true labels from noisy labels. An alternate approach would be to look for loss functions that are inherently noise-tolerant. For binary classification there exist theoretical results on loss functions that are robust to label noise. In this paper, we provide some sufficient conditions on a loss function so that risk minimization under that loss function would be inherently tolerant to label noise for multiclass classification problems. These results generalize the existing results on noise-tolerant loss functions for binary classification. We study some of the widely used loss functions in deep networks and show that the loss function based on mean absolute value of error is inherently robust to label noise. Thus standard back propagation is enough to learn the true classifier even under label noise. Through experiments, we illustrate the robustness of risk minimization with such loss functions for learning neural networks",

To address these issues, we propose an optimal neighborhood kernel clustering (ONKC) algorithm to enhance the representability of the optimal kernel and strengthen the negotiation between kernel learning and clustering. We theoretically justify this ONKC by revealing its connection with existing MKKM algorithms. Furthermore, this justification shows that existing MKKM algorithms can be viewed as a special case of our approach and indicates the extendability of the proposed ONKC for designing better clustering algorithms.

    "abstract": "Structured regression on graphs aims to predict response variables from multiple nodes by discovering and exploiting the dependency structure among response variables. This problem is challenging since dependencies among response variables are always unknown, and the associated prior knowledge is non-symmetric. In previous studies, various promising solutions were proposed to improve structured regression by utilizing symmetric prior knowledge, learning sparse dependency structure among response variables, or learning representations of attributes of multiple nodes. However, none of them are capable of efficiently learning dependency structure while incorporating non-symmetric prior knowledge. To achieve these objectives, we proposed Continuous Conditional Dependency Network (CCDN) for structured regression. The intuitive idea behind this model is that each response variable is not only dependent on attributes from the same node, but also on response variables from all other nodes. This results in a joint modeling of local conditional probabilities. The parameter learning is formulated as a convex optimization problem and an effective sampling algorithm is proposed for inference. CCDN is flexible in absorbing non-symmetric prior knowledge. The performance of CCDN on multiple datasets provides evidence of its structure recovery ability and superior effectiveness and efficiency as compared to the state-of-the-art alternatives",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "This paper aims to provide a sharp excess risk guarantee for learning a sparse linear model without any assumptions about the strong convexity of the expected loss and the sparsity of the optimal solution in hindsight. Given a target level ε for the excess risk, an interesting question to ask is how many examples and how large the support set of the solution are enough for learning a good model with the target excess risk. To answer these questions, we present a two-stage algorithm that (i) in the first stage an epoch based stochastic optimization algorithm is exploited with an established O(1/ε) bound on the sample complexity; and (ii) in the second stage a distribution dependent randomized sparsification is presented with an O(1/ε) bound on the sparsity (referred to as support complexity) of the resulting model. Compared to previous works, our contributions lie at (i) we reduce the order of the sample complexity from O(1/ε2) to O(1/ε) without the strong convexity assumption; and (ii) we reduce the constant in O(1/ε) for the sparsity by exploring the distribution dependent sampling",

In this model, the mapping from the continuous latent factors to the observed signal is parametrized by a convolutional neural network. The alternating back-propagation algorithm iterates the following two steps: (1) Inferential back-propagation, which infers the latent factors by Langevin dynamics or gradient descent. (2) Learning back-propagation, which updates the parameters given the inferred latent factors by gradient descent. The gradient computations in both steps are powered by back-propagation, and they share most of their code in common.

Recently, new deep learning approaches have emerged for representing and modeling graph-structured data while the conventional deep learning methods, such as convolutional neural networks and recurrent neural networks, have mainly focused on the grid-structured inputs of image and audio. Leveraged by representation learning capabilities, deep learning-based techniques can detect structural characteristics of graphs, giving promising results for graph applications. In this paper, we attempt to advance deep learning for graph-structured data by incorporating another component: transfer learning. By transferring the intrinsic geometric information learned in the source domain, our approach can construct a model for a new but related task in the target domain without collecting new data and without training a new model from scratch. We thoroughly tested our approach with large-scale real-world text data and confirmed the effectiveness of the proposed transfer learning framework for deep learning on graphs. According to our experiments, transfer learning is most effective when the source and target domains bear a high level of structural similarity in their graph representations",

In particular, the two widely used indexes of Adjusted Rand Index (ARI), and Normalized Mutual Information (NMI), are special cases of the CAI. Our index, therefore, provides overlapping extensions for both these commonly used indexes, whereas their original formulations are only defined for disjoint cases.

    "title": "Ordinal Constrained Binary Code Learning for Nearest Neighbor Search",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Recent years have witnessed extensive attention in binary code learning, a.k.a. hashing, for nearest neighbor search problems. It has been seen that high-dimensional data points can quantize into binary codes to give an efficient similarity approximation via Hamming distance. Among the existing schemes, ranking-based hashing is recent promising that targets at preserving ordinal relations of ranking in the Hamming space to minimize retrieval loss. However, the size of the ranking tuples that show the ordinal relations, is quadratic or cubic to the size of training samples. It is so very expensive to embed such ranking tuples in binary code learning, especially given a large-scale training data set. Besides, it remains difficult to build ranking tuples efficiently for most ranking-preserving hashing, which are deployed over an ordinal graph-based setting. To handle these problems, we propose a novel ranking-preserving hashing method, dubbed Ordinal Constraint Hashing (OCH), which efficiently learns the optimal hashing functions with a graph-based approximation to embed the ordinal relations. The core idea is to reduce the size of ordinal graph with ordinal constraint projection, which preserves the ordinal relations through a small data set (such as clusters or random samples). In particular, to learn such hash functions effectively, we further relax the discrete constraints and design a specific stochastic gradient decent algorithm for optimization. Experimental results on three large-scale visual search benchmark datasets, i.e. LabelMe, Tiny100K and GIST1M, show that the proposed OCH method can achieve superior performance over the state-of-the-arts approaches",

By making that structure explicit, we design learning algorithms to recover the classes with low label complexity. We provide results for the commonly studied cases of one-vs-all learning and when the codewords of the classes are well separated.

First, we account for cost-sensitivity when converting the multi-label problem to a single-label problem at each node in the tree. Second, we introduce a new objective function for determining oblique splits based on the Hellinger distance, a splitting criterion that has been shown to be robust to class imbalance.

Two classic proximal optimization algorithms, i.e., proximal stochastic gradient descent (ProxSGD) and proximal stochastic coordinate descent (ProxSCD) have been widely used to solve the R-ERM problem. Recently, variance reduction technique was proposed to improve ProxSGD and ProxSCD, and the corresponding ProxSVRG and ProxSVRCD have better convergence rate. These proximal algorithms with variance reduction technique have also achieved great success in applications at small and moderate scales. However, in order to solve large-scale R-ERM problems and make more practical impacts, the parallel versions of these algorithms are sorely needed. In this paper, we propose asynchronous ProxSVRG (Async-ProxSVRG) and asynchronous ProxSVRCD (Async-ProxSVRCD) algorithms, and prove that Async-ProxSVRG can achieve near linear speedup when the training data is sparse, while Async-ProxSVRCD can achieve near linear speedup regardless of the sparse condition, as long as the number of block partitions are appropriately set. We have conducted experiments on a regularized logistic regression task.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "One of the long standing goals of Artificial Intelligence (AI) is to build cognitive agents which can perform complex tasks from raw sensory inputs without explicit supervision. Recent progress in combining Reinforcement Learning objective functions and Deep Learning architectures has achieved promising results for such tasks. An important aspect of such sequential decision making problems, which has largely been neglected, is for the agent to decide on the duration of time for which to commit to actions. Such action repetition is important for computational efficiency, which is necessary for the agent to respond in real-time to events (in applications such as self-driving cars). Action Repetition arises naturally in real life as well as simulated environments. The time scale of executing an action enables an agent (both humans and AI) to decide the granularity of control during task execution. Current state of the art Deep Reinforcement Learning models, whether they are off-policy or on-policy, consist of a framework with a static action repetition paradigm, wherein the action decided by the agent is repeated for a fixed number of time steps regardless of the contextual state while executing the task. In this paper, we propose a new framework - Dynamic Action Repetition which changes Action Repetition Rate (the time scale of repeating an action) from a hyper-parameter of an algorithm to a dynamically learnable quantity. At every decision-making step, our models allow the agent to commit to an action and the time scale of executing the action. We show empirically that such a dynamic time scale mechanism improves the performance on relatively harder games in the Atari 2600 domain, independent of the underlying Deep Reinforcement Learning algorithm used",

    "abstract": "Many machine learning tasks can be formulated as Regularized Empirical Risk Minimization (R-ERM), and solved by optimization algorithms such as gradient descent (GD), stochastic gradient descent (SGD), and stochastic variance reduction (SVRG). Conventional analysis on these optimization algorithms focuses on their convergence rates during the training process, however, people in the machine learning community may care more about the generalization performance of the learned model on unseen test data. In this paper, we investigate on this issue, by using stability as a tool. In particular, we decompose the generalization error for R-ERM, and derive its upper bound for both convex and nonconvex cases. In convex cases, we prove that the generalization error can be bounded by the convergence rate of the optimization algorithm and the stability of the R-ERM process, both in expectation (in the order of",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Many machine learning models, such as logistic regression (LR) and support vector machine (SVM), can be formulated as composite optimization problems. Recently, many distributed stochastic optimization (DSO) methods have been proposed to solve the large-scale composite optimization problems, which have shown better performance than traditional batch methods. However, most of these DSO methods might not be scalable enough. In this paper, we propose a novel DSO method, called scalable composite optimization for learning (SCOPE), and implement it on the fault-tolerant distributed platform Spark. SCOPE is both computation-efficient and communication-efficient. Theoretical analysis shows that SCOPE is convergent with linear convergence rate when the objective function is strongly convex. Furthermore, empirical results on real datasets show that SCOPE can outperform other state-of-the-art distributed learning methods on Spark, including both batch learning methods and DSO methods",

    "abstract": "Motivated by models of human decision making proposed to explain commonly observed deviations from conventional expected value preferences, we formulate two stochastic multi-armed bandit problems with distorted probabilities on the cost distributions: the classic K-armed bandit and the linearly parameterized bandit. In both settings, we propose algorithms that are inspired by Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) algorithms, incorporate cost distortions, and exhibit sublinear regret assuming Holder continuous weight distortion functions. For the K-armed setting, we show that the algorithm, called W-UCB, achieves problem-dependent regret O(L2M2 log n / Δ(2/α – 1), where n is the number of plays, Δ is the gap in distorted expected value between the best and next best arm, L and alpha are the Holder constants for the distortion function, and M is an upper bound on costs, and a problem-independent regret bound of O((KL2M2)(α/2)n(2 – α)/2)). We also present a matching lower bound on the regret, showing that the regret of W-UCB is essentially unimprovable over the class of Holder-continuous weight distortions. For the linearly parameterized setting, we develop a new algorithm, a variant of the Optimism in the Face of Uncertainty Linear bandit (OFUL) algorithm called WOFUL (Weight-distorted OFUL), and show that it has regret O(d√n polylog(n)) with high probability, for sub-Gaussian cost distributions",

Given part annotations on very few (e.g., 3-12) objects, our method mines certain latent patterns from the pre-trained CNN and associates them with different semantic parts. We use a four-layer And-Or graph to organize the CNN units, so as to clarify their internal semantic hierarchy.

The side information is incorporated by conditioning the row and column latent factors on the available side information via a regression model. Our model can not only perform matrix factorization and completion with side-information, but also infers interpretable latent topics that explain/summarize the data. An appealing aspect of our model is in the full local conjugacy of all parts of the model, including the main latent factor model, as well as for the regression model that leverages the side information. This enables us to design scalable and simple to implement Gibbs sampling and Expectation Maximization algorithms for doing inference in the model. Inference cost in our model scales in the number of nonzeros in the data matrix, which makes it particularly attractive for massive, sparse matrices.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Feature selection is a fundamental problem in machine learning and data mining. The majority of feature selection algorithms are designed for running on a single machine (centralized setting) and they are less applicable to very large datasets. Although there are some distributed methods to tackle this problem, most of them are distributing the data horizontally which are not suitable for datasets with a large number of features and few number of instances. Thus, in this paper, we introduce a novel vertically distributable feature selection method in order to speed up this process and be able to handle very large datasets in a scalable manner. In general, feature selection methods aim at selecting relevant and non-redundant features (Minimum Redundancy and Maximum Relevance). It is much harder to consider redundancy in a vertically distributed setting than a centralized setting since there is no global access to the whole data. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt toward solving the feature selection problem with a vertically distributed filter method which handles the redundancy with consistently comparable results with centralized methods. In this paper, we formalize the feature selection problem as a diversity maximization problem by introducing a mutual-information-based metric distance on the features. We show the effectiveness of our method by performing an extensive empirical study. In particular, we show that our distributed method outperforms state-of-the-art centralized feature selection algorithms on a variety of datasets. From a theoretical point of view, we have proved that the used greedy algorithm in our method achieves an approximation factor of 1/4 for the diversity maximization problem in a distributed setting with high probability. Furthermore, we improve this to 8/25 expected approximation using multiplicity in our distribution",

In this work we focus on unitary operators and describe a parametrization using the Lie algebra u(n) associated with the Lie group U(n) of n × n unitary matrices. The exponential map provides a correspondence between these spaces, and allows us to define a unitary matrix using n2 real coefficients relative to a basis of the Lie algebra. The parametrization is closed under additive updates of these coefficients, and thus provides a simple space in which to do gradient descent. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this parametrization on the problem of learning arbitrary unitary operators, comparing to several baselines and outperforming a recently-proposed lower-dimensional parametrization. We additionally use our parametrization to generalize a recently-proposed unitary recurrent neural network to arbitrary unitary matrices, using it to solve standard long-memory tasks",

To address this issue, we consider an ordered combinatorial semi-bandit problem where the learner recommends S actions from a base set of K actions, and displays the results in S (out of M) different positions. The aim is to maximize the cumulative reward with respect to the best possible subset and positions in hindsight. By the adaptation of a minimum-cost maximum-flow network, a practical algorithm based on Thompson sampling is derived for the (contextual) combinatorial problem, thus resolving the problem of computational intractability.With its potential to work with whole-page recommendation and any probabilistic models, to illustrate the effectiveness of our method, we focus on Gaussian process optimization and a contextual setting where click-through rate is predicted using logistic regression.

    "abstract": "We provide the first theoretical analysis on the convergence rate of asynchronous mini-batch gradient descent with variance reduction (AsySVRG) for non-convex optimization. Asynchronous stochastic gradient descent (AsySGD) has been broadly used for deep learning optimization, and it is proved to converge with rate of O(1/\\sqrt{T}) for non-convex optimization. Recently, variance reduction technique is proposed and it is proved to be able to accelerate the convergence of SGD greatly. It is shown that asynchronous SGD method with variance reduction technique has linear convergence rate when problem is strongly convex. However, there is still no work to analyze the convergence rate of this method for non-convex problem. In this paper, we consider two asynchronous parallel implementations of mini-batch gradient descent method with variance reduction: one is on distributed-memory architecture and the other is on shared-memory architecture. We prove that both methods can converge with a rate of O(1/T) for non-convex optimization, and linear speedup is accessible when we increase the number of workers. We evaluate our methods by optimizing multi-layer neural networks on two real datasets (MNIST and CIFAR-10), and experimental results demonstrate our theoretical analysis",

In this paper we present an approach based upon polynomial optimization techniques that both improves the convergence time of matrix factorization algorithms and helps them escape from local optima. Our method is based on the realization that given a joint search direction in a matrix factorization task, we can solve the ``subspace search'' problem (the task of jointly finding the steps to take in each direction) by solving a bivariate quartic polynomial optimization problem. We derive two methods for solving this problem based upon sum of squares moment relaxations and the Durand-Kerner method, then apply these techniques on matrix factorization to derive a direct coordinate descent approach and a method for speeding up existing approaches. On three benchmark datasets we show the method substantially improves convergence speed over state-of-the-art approaches, while also attaining lower objective value",

However, such methods typically require extensive experience for successful behavior due to their tabula rasa nature. Multitask RL is an approach, which aims to reduce data requirements by allowing knowledge transfer between tasks. Although successful, current multitask learning methods suffer from scalability issues when considering large number of tasks. The main reasons behind this limitation is the reliance on centralized solutions. This paper proposes to a novel distributed multitask RL framework, improving the scalability across many different types of tasks. Our framework maps multitask RL to an instance of general consensus and develops an efficient decentralized solver.

This paper partially redresses this imbalance by extending some standard probabilistic modelling tools to the circular domain. First we introduce a new multivariate distribution over circular variables, called the multivariate Generalised von Mises (mGvM) distribution. This distribution can be constructed by restricting and renormalising a general multivariate Gaussian distribution to the unit hyper-torus. Previously proposed multivariate circular distributions are shown to be special cases of this construction. Second, we introduce a new probabilistic model for circular regression inspired by Gaussian Processes, and a method for probabilistic Principal Component Analysis with circular hidden variables. These models can leverage standard modelling tools (e.g. kernel functions and automatic relevance determination). Third, we show that the posterior distribution in these models is a mGvM distribution which enables development of an efficient variational free-energy scheme for performing approximate inference and approximate maximum-likelihood learning",

Instead of using single centroid for each cluster, we introduce multiple local centroids for individual cluster such that the manifold structure can be captured by the local centroids. Such a novel NMF method can improve the clustering performance effectively. Furthermore, a novel bipartite graph is incorporated to obtain the clustering indicator directly without any post process.

    "abstract": "In order for reinforcement learning systems to learn quickly in vast action spaces such as the space of all possible pieces of text or the space of all images, leveraging human intuition and creativity is key. However, a human-designed action space is likely to be initially imperfect and limited; furthermore, humans may improve at creating useful actions with practice or new information. Therefore, we propose a framework in which a human adds actions to a reinforcement learning system over time to boost performance. In this setting, however, it is key that we use human effort as efficiently as possible, and one significant danger is that humans waste effort adding actions at places (states) that aren't very important. Therefore, we propose Expected Local Improvement (ELI), an automated method which selects states at which to query humans for a new action. We evaluate ELI on a variety of simulated domains adapted from the literature, including domains with over a million actions and domains where the simulated experts change over time. We find ELI demonstrates excellent empirical performance, even in settings where the synthetic \"experts\" are quite poor",

To handle this out-of-sample problem, many inductive methods make a constraint such that the predicted label matrix should be exactly equal to a linear model. In practice, this constraint might be too rigid to capture the manifold structure of data. In this paper, we relax this rigid constraint and propose to use an elastic constraint on the predicted label matrix such that the manifold structure can be better explored. Moreover, since unlabeled data are often very abundant in practice and usually there are some outliers, we use a non-squared loss instead of the traditional squared loss to learn a robust model. The derived problem, although is convex, has so many nonsmooth terms, which make it very challenging to solve.

Firstly, across a diverse range of benchmark tasks, ranging from relation extraction to text categorization and scene classification, MIML-perf offers superior performance as compared to state of the art methods designed specifically for these tasks.

Because the SVM methods use the hinge loss or squared hinge loss functions for classifications, they usually outperform other classification approaches, e.g. the least square loss function based methods. However, like most supervised learning algorithms, they learn classifiers based on the labeled data in training set without specific strategy to deal with the noise data. In many real-world applications, we often have data outliers in train set, which could misguide the classifiers learning, such that the classification performance is suboptimal. To address this problem, we proposed a novel capped Lp-norm SVM classification model by utilizing the capped `p-norm based hinge loss in the objective which can deal with both light and heavy outliers. We utilize the new formulation to naturally build the multiclass capped Lp-norm SVM. More importantly, we derive a novel optimization algorithms to efficiently minimize the capped Lp-norm based objectives, and also rigorously prove the convergence of proposed algorithms. We present experimental results showing that employing the new capped Lp-norm SVM method can consistently improve the classification performance, especially in the cases when the data noise level increases",

    "abstract": "Evolutionary game theory focuses on the fitness differences between simple discrete or probabilistic strategies to explain the evolution of particular decision-making behavior within strategic situations. Although this approach has provided substantial insights into the presence of fairness or generosity in gift-giving games, it does not fully resolve the question of which cognitive mechanisms are required to produce the choices observed in experiments. One such mechanism that humans have acquired, is the capacity to anticipate. Prior work showed that forward-looking behavior, using a recurrent neural network to model the cognitive mechanism, are essential to produce the actions of human participants in behavioral experiments. In this paper, we evaluate whether this conclusion extends also to gift-giving games, more concretely, to a game that combines the dictator game with a partner selection process. The recurrent neural network model used here for dictators, allows them to reason about a best response to past actions of the receivers (reactive model) or to decide which action will lead to a more successful outcome in the future (anticipatory model). We show for both models the decision dynamics while training, as well as the average behavior. We find that the anticipatory model is the only one capable of accounting for changes in the context of the game, a behavior also observed in experiments, expanding previous conclusions to this more sophisticated game",

It is popular to apply SRL or PILPtechniques to exploit human knowledge through learning of symbolic data, or statistical learning techniques to learn from the raw data samples; however, it is often desired to directly exploit these logic formulae on raw data processing, like human beings utilizing knowledge to guide perception. In this paper, we propose an approach, LASIN, which combines Logical Abduction and Statistical Induction. The LASIN approach generates candidate hypotheses based on the abduction of first-order formulae, and then, the hypotheses are exploited as constraints for statistical induction. We apply theLASIN approach to the learning of representation of written primitives, where a primitive is a basic component in human writing. Our results show that the discovered primitives are reasonable for human perception, and these primitives, if used in learning tasks such as classification and domain adaptation, lead to better performances than simply applying feature learning based on raw data only",

In this sense, our method provides a cognitively plausible way of building representations, consistent with the inherently re-constructive and associative nature of human memory. Using seven benchmark concept similarity tests we show that the mapped (or imagined) vectors not only help to fuse multimodal information, but also outperform strong unimodal baselines and state-of-the-art multimodal methods, thus exhibiting more human-like judgments.

A possible approximation that humans may use to do this is to only metareason over a finite set of cognitive systems that perform variable amounts of computation. The highly influential \"dual-process\" accounts of human cognition, which postulate the coexistence of a slow accurate system with a fast error-prone system, can be seen as a special case of this approximation. This raises two questions: how many cognitive systems should a bounded optimal agent be equipped with and what characteristics should those systems have? We investigate these questions in two settings: a one-shot decision between two alternatives, and planning under uncertainty in a Markov decision process. We find that the optimal number of systems depends on the variability of the environment and the costliness of metareasoning. Consistent with dual-process theories, we also find that when having two systems is optimal, then the first system is fast but error-prone and the second system is slow but accurate",

Novel contributions of this approach include a framework to trigger new analyses appropriate for the available data through lines of inquiry that support progressive hypothesis evolution, and a representation of hypothesis revisions with provenance records that can be used to inspect the results. We implemented our approach in the DISK framework, and evaluated it using two scenarios from cancer multi-omics: 1) data for new patients becomes available over time, 2) new types of data for the same patients are released.

    "abstract": "Measuring reading effort is useful for practical purposes such as designing learning material and personalizing text comprehension environment. We propose a quantification of reading effort by measuring the complexity of eye-movement patterns of readers. We call the measure Scanpath Complexity. Scanpath complexity is modeled as a function of various properties of gaze fixations and saccades- the basic parameters of eye movement behavior. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our scanpath complexity measure by showing that its correlation with different measures of lexical and syntactic complexity as well as standard readability metrics is better than popular baseline measures based on fixation alone",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Commonsense reasoning at scale is a critical problem for modern cognitive systems. Large theories have millions of axioms, but only a handful are relevant for answering a given goal query. Irrelevant axioms increase the search space, overwhelming unoptimized inference engines in large theories. Therefore, methods that help in identifying useful inference paths are an essential part of large cognitive systems. In this paper, we use retrograde analysis to build a database of proof paths that lead to at least one successful proof. This database helps the inference engine identify more productive parts of the search space. A heuristic based on this approach is used to order nodes during a search. We study the efficacy of this approach on hundreds of queries from the Cyc KB. Empirical results show that this approach leads to significant reduction in inference time",

The input to the system consists of video clips of a manually controlled robot arm, paired with natural language commands describing the action. No prior knowledge is assumed about the meaning of words, or the structure of the language, except that there are different classes of words (corresponding to observable actions, spatial relations, and objects and their observable properties). The learning process automatically clusters the continuous perceptual spaces into concepts corresponding to linguistic input. A novel relational graph representation is used to build connections between language and vision. As well as the grounding of language to perception, the system also induces a set of probabilistic grammar rules.

    "abstract": "Structured knowledge about concepts plays an increasingly important role in areas such as information retrieval. The available ontologies and knowledge graphs that encode such conceptual knowledge, however, are inevitably incomplete. This observation has led to a number of methods that aim to automatically complete existing knowledge bases. Unfortunately, most existing approaches rely on black box models, e.g. formulated as global optimization problems, which makes it difficult to support the underlying reasoning process with intuitive explanations. In this paper, we propose a new method for knowledge base completion, which uses interpretable conceptual space representations and an explicit model for inductive inference that is closer to human forms of commonsense reasoning. Moreover, by separating the task of representation learning from inductive reasoning, our method is easier to apply in a wider variety of contexts. Finally, unlike optimization based approaches, our method can naturally be applied in settings where various logical constraints between the extensions of concepts need to be taken into account",

Its knowledge is collected from many sources that include expert-created resources, crowd-sourcing, and games with a purpose. It is designed to represent the general knowledge involved in understanding language, improving natural language applications by allowing the application to better understand the meanings behind the words people use. When ConceptNet is combined with word embeddings acquired from distributional semantics (such as word2vec), it provides applications with understanding that they would not acquire from distributional semantics alone, nor from narrower resources such as WordNet or DBPedia. We demonstrate this with state-of-the-art results on intrinsic evaluations of word relatedness that translate into improvements on applications of word vectors, including solving SAT-style analogies",

We demonstrate empirically FPM's ability to construct new generic processes when necessary and to transfer them later to new modeling tasks.

    "abstract": "Accurate electricity demand forecast plays a key role in sustainable power systems. It enables better decision making in the planning of electricity generation and distribution for many use cases. The electricity demand data can often be represented in a hierarchical structure. For example, the electricity consumption of a whole country could be disaggregated by states, cities, and households. Hierarchical forecasts require not only good prediction accuracy at each level of the hierarchy, but also the consistency between different levels. State-of-the-art hierarchical forecasting methods usually apply adjustments on the individual level forecasts to satisfy the aggregation constraints. However, the high-dimensionality of the unpenalized regression problem and the estimation errors in the high-dimensional error covariance matrix can lead to increased variability in the revised forecasts with poor prediction performance. In order to provide more robustness to estimation errors in the adjustments, we present a new hierarchical forecasting algorithm that computes sparse adjustments while still preserving the aggregation constraints. We formulate the problem as a high-dimensional penalized regression, which can be efficiently solved using cyclical coordinate descent methods. We also conduct experiments using a large-scale hierarchical electricity demand data. The results confirm the effectiveness of our approach compared to state-of-the-art hierarchical forecasting methods, in both the sparsity of the adjustments and the prediction accuracy. The proposed approach to hierarchical forecasting could be useful for energy generation including solar and wind energy, as well as numerous other applications",

However, accurate mapping requires accurate data collection, which is both expensive and labor intensive. Satellite imagery is increasingly becoming abundant, higher in resolution and affordable. Given the recent successes deep learning has achieved in the visual recognition field, we are interested in investigating whether it is possible to use deep learning to accurately predict road safety directly from raw satellite imagery. To this end, we propose a deep learning-based mapping approach that leverages open data to learn from raw satellite imagery robust deep models able to predict accurate city-scale road safety maps at an affordable cost. To empirically validate the proposed approach, we trained a deep model on satellite images obtained from over 647 thousand traffic-accident reports collected over a period of four years by the New York city Police Department. The best model predicted road safety from raw satellite imagery with an accuracy of 78%. We also used the New York city model to predict for the city of Denver a city-scale map indicating road safety in three levels. Compared to a map made from three years' worth of data collected by the Denver city Police Department, the map predicted from raw satellite imagery has an accuracy of 73%",

One way of delivering simple solutions is to represent the policy with a small number of alpha-vectors. We would like to find the best possible policy that can be expressed using a fixed number N of alpha-vectors. We call this the N-POMDP problem. The existing solver alpha-min approximately solves finite-horizon POMDPs with a controllable number of alpha-vectors. However alpha-min is a greedy algorithm without performance guarantees, and it is rather slow. This paper proposes three new algorithms, based on a general approach that we call alpha-min-2. These three algorithms are able to approximately solve N-POMDPs. Alpha-min-2-fast (heuristic) and alpha-min-2-p (with performance guarantees) are designed to complement an existing POMDP solver, while alpha-min-2-solve (heuristic) is a solver itself. Complexity results are provided for each of the algorithms, and they are tested on well-known benchmarks. These new algorithms will help users to interpret solutions to POMDP problems in computational sustainability",

Informally described as 'learning by doing', this approach aims to trade off between decisions that help achieve the objective and decisions that will yield a better knowledge of the true transition matrix. When the true transition matrix is assumed to be an element of a finite set of possible matrices, solving a mixed observability Markov decision process (MOMDP) leads to an optimal trade-off but is very computationally demanding. Under the assumption (common in adaptive management) that the true transition matrix is stationary, we propose a polynomial-time algorithm to find a lower bound of the value function. In the corners of the domain of the value function (belief space), this lower bound is provably equal to the optimal value function. We also show that under further assumptions, it is a linear approximation of the optimal value function in a neighborhood around the corners. We evaluate the benefits of our approach by using it to initialize the solvers MO-SARSOP and Perseus on a novel computational sustainability problem and a recent adaptive management data challenge. Our approach leads to an improved initial value function and translates into significant computational gains for both solvers",

To that end, the United States spends more than 1 billion dollars a year gathering census data such as race, gender, education, occupation and unemployment rates. Compared to the traditional method of collecting surveys across many years which is costly and labor intensive, data-driven, machine learning-driven approaches are cheaper and faster—with the potential ability to detect trends in close to real time. In this work, we leverage the ubiquity of Google Street View images and develop a computer vision pipeline to predict income, per capita carbon emission, crime rates and other city attributes from a single source of publicly available visual data. We first detect cars in 50 million images across 200 of the largest US cities and train a model to predict demographic attributes using the detected cars. To facilitate our work, we have collected the largest and most challenging fine-grained dataset reported to date consisting of over 2600 classes of cars comprised of images from Google Street View and other web sources, classified by car experts to account for even the most subtle of visual differences. We use this data to construct the largest scale fine-grained detection system reported to date. Our prediction results correlate well with ground truth income data (r=0.82), Massachusetts department of vehicle registration, and sources investigating crime rates, income segregation, per capita carbon emission, and other market research.

Our method takes into account the fact that local animal density and connectivity change dynamically and non-linearly with different habitat protection plans. In order to scale up our encoding, we propose a sampling scheme via random partitioning of the search space using parity functions.

It has several applications in computational sustainability including spatial conservation planning, pre-disaster network preparation, and river network optimization. A common assumption in previous work has been made that network parameters (e.g., probability of species colonization) are precisely known, which is unrealistic in real- world settings. We therefore address the robust river network design problem where the goal is to optimize river connectivity for fish movement by removing barriers. We assume that fish passability probabilities are known only imprecisely, but are within some interval bounds. We then develop a planning approach that computes the policies with either high robust ratio or low regret. Empirically, our approach scales well to large river networks. We also provide insights into the solutions generated by our robust approach, which has significantly higher robust ratio than the baseline solution with mean parameter estimates",

One source of data for building species distribution models is citizen science, in which volunteers report locations where they observed (or did not observe) sets of species. Since volunteers have variable levels of expertise, citizen science data may contain both false positives and false negatives in the location labels (present vs. absent) they provide, but many common modeling approaches for this task do not address these sources of noise explicitly. In this paper, we propose to formulate the species distribution modeling task as a classification problem with class-conditional noise. Our approach builds on other applications of class-conditional noise models to crowdsourced data, but we focus on leveraging features of the noise processes that are distinct from the class features. We describe the conditions under which the parameters of our proposed model are identifiable and apply it to simulated data and data from the eBird citizen science project",

    "title": "Counting-Based Reliability Estimation for Power-Transmission Grids",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Modern society is increasingly reliant on the functionality of infrastructure facilities and utility services. Consequently, there has been surge of interest in the problem of quantification of system reliability, which is known to be #P-complete. Reliability also contributes to the resilience of systems, so as to effectively make them bounce back after contingencies. Despite diverse progress, most techniques to estimate system reliability and resilience remain computationally expensive. In this paper, we investigate how recent advances in hashing-based approaches to counting can be exploited to improve computational techniques for system reliability.The primary contribution of this paper is a novel framework, RelNet, that reduces the problem of computing reliability for a given network to counting the number of satisfying assignments of a Σ11 formula, which is amenable to recent hashing-based techniques developed for counting satisfying assignments of SAT formula. We then apply RelNet to ten real world power-transmission grids across different cities in the U.S. and are able to obtain, to the best of our knowledge, the first theoretically sound a priori estimates of reliability between several pairs of nodes of interest. Such estimates will help managing uncertainty and support rational decision making for community resilience",

    "title": "Matrix Factorisation for Scalable Energy Breakdown",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Homes constitute more than one-thirds of the total energy consumption. Producing an energy breakdown for a home has been shown to reduce household energy consumption by up to 15%, among other benefits. However, existing approaches to produce an energy breakdown require hardware to be installed in each home and are thus prohibitively expensive. In this paper, we propose a novel application of feature-based matrix factorisation that does not require any additional hard- ware installation. The basic premise of our approach is that common design and construction patterns for homes create a repeating structure in their energy data. Thus, a sparse basis can be used to represent energy data from a broad range of homes. We evaluate our approach on 516 homes from a publicly available data set and find it to be more effective than five baseline approaches that either require sensing in each home, or a very rigorous survey across a large number of homes coupled with complex modelling. We also present a deployment of our system as a live web application that can potentially provide energy breakdown to millions of homes",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Future projection of climate is typically obtained by combining outputs from multiple Earth System Models (ESMs) for several climate variables such as temperature and precipitation. While IPCC has traditionally used a simple model output average, recent work has illustrated potential advantages of using a multitask learning (MTL) framework for projections of individual climate variables. In this paper we introduce a framework for hierarchical multitask learning (HMTL) with two levels of tasks such that each super-task, i.e., task at the top level, is itself a multitask learning problem over sub-tasks. For climate projections, each super-task focuses on projections of specific climate variables spatially using an MTL formulation. For the proposed HMTL approach, a group lasso regularization is added to couple parameters across the super-tasks, which in the climate context helps exploit relationships among the behavior of different climate variables at a given spatial location. We show that some recent works on MTL based on learning task dependency structures can be viewed as special cases of HMTL. Experiments on synthetic and real climate data show that HMTL produces better results than decoupled MTL methods applied separately on the super-tasks and HMTL significantly outperforms baselines for climate projection",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a genetically complex neurodegenerative disease, which leads to irreversible brain damage, severe cognitive problems and ultimately death. A number of clinical trials and study initiatives have been set up to investigate AD pathology, leading to large amounts of high dimensional heterogeneous data (biomarkers) for analysis. This paper focuses on combining clinical features from different modalities, including medical imaging, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), etc., to diagnose AD and predict potential progression. Due to privacy and legal issues involved with clinical research, the study cohort (number of patients) is relatively small, compared to thousands of available biomarkers (predictors). We propose a hybrid pathological analysis model, which integrates manifold learning and Random Vector functional-link network (RVFL) so as to achieve better ability to extract discriminant information with limited training materials. Furthermore, we model (current and future) cognitive healthiness as a regression problem about age. By comparing the difference between predicted age and actual age, we manage to show statistical differences between different pathological stages. Verification tests are conducted based on the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database. Extensive comparison is made against different machine learning algorithms, i.e. Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF), Decision Tree and Multilayer Perceptron (MLP). Experimental results show that our proposed algorithm achieves better results than the comparison targets, which indicates promising robustness for practical clinical implementation",

However, cooperative tasks where a semi-autonomous robot serves as an extension of the human hand have rarely been studied in the context of hand-eye coordination. We hypothesize that accounting for anticipatory eye movements in addition to the movements of the robot will improve intent estimation. This research compares the application of various machine learning methods to intent prediction from gaze tracking data during robotic hand-eye coordination tasks.

In this paper, we develop the Planning Projector system prototype, which applies plan-recognition-as-planning technique to both explain the observations derived from analyzing relevant news and social media, and project a range of possible future state trajectories for human review. Unlike the plan recognition problem, where a set of goals, and often a plan library must be given as part of the input, the Planning Projector system takes as input the domain knowledge, a sequence of observations derived from the news, a time horizon, and the number of trajectories to produce. It then computes the set of trajectories by applying a planner capable of finding a set of high-quality plans on a transformed planning problem. The Planning Projector prototype integrates several components including: (1) knowledge engineering: the process of encoding the domain knowledge from domain experts; (2) data transformation: the problem of analyzing and transforming the raw data into a sequence of observations; (3) trajectory computation: characterizing the future state projection problem and computing a set of trajectories; (4) user interface: clustering and visualizing the trajectories. We evaluate our approach qualitatively and conclude that the Planning Projector helps users understand future possibilities so that they can make more informed decisions",

Many robot behaviors can be controlled through numeric parameters (called control variables), which affect the rate of the continuous change. Previous approaches capable of reasoning efficiently with control variables impose severe restrictions that limit the expressivity of the problems that can be solved. A broad class of robotic applications require, for example, convex quadratic constraints on state variables and control variables that are jointly constrained and that affect multiple state variables simultaneously. However, extensions to prior approaches are not straightforward, since these characteristics are non-linear and hard to scale. We introduce cqScotty, a heuristic forward search planner that solves these problems efficiently. While naive formulations of consistency checks are not convex and do not scale, cqScotty uses an efficient convex formulation, in the form of a Second Order Cone Program (SOCP), that is very fast to solve. We demonstrate the scalability of our approach on three new realistic domains",

This type of planning is interesting, for instance, in smart home environments which contain various sensors and robots to provide services to the inhabitants. Requests for information, for instance from an activity recognition system, should cause the smart home to configure itself in such a way that all requested information will be provided when it is needed. This paper addresses temporal configuration planning in which information availability and goals are linked to temporal intervals which are subject to constrains. Our solutions are based on constraint-based planning which uses different types of constraints to model different types of knowledge. We propose and compare two approaches to configuration planning. The first one models information via conditions and effects of planning operators and essentially reduces configuration planning to constraint-based temporal planning. The second approach solves information dependencies separately from task planning and optimizes the cost of reaching individual information goals. We compare these approaches in terms of the time it takes to solve problems and the quality of the solutions they provide",

In our experiments, we achieve up to 9.4% and 16.6% accuracy improvements using the oracle and the detected bounding boxes, respectively, over the vision-only recognizers.

When computers and robots interact with people, they need to recognize human plans and react appropriately. Plan and goal recognition techniques have focused on identifying an agent's task given a sufficiently long action sequence. However, by the time the plan and/or goal are recognized, it may be too late for computing an interactive response. We propose an integration of planning with probabilistic recognition where each method uses intermediate results from the other as a guiding heuristic for recognition of the plan/goal in-progress as well as the interactive response. We show that, like the used recognition method, these interaction problems can be compiled into classical planning problems and solved using off-the-shelf methods. In addition to the methodology, this paper introduces problem categories for different forms of interaction, an evaluation metric for the benefits from the interaction, and extensions to the recognition algorithm that make its intermediate results more practical while the plan is in progress",

With this in mind, we outline in this paper a new paradigm for social network analysis, whereby the strategic behaviour of network actors is explicitly modeled. Addressing this research challenge has various implications. For instance, it may allow two individuals to keep their relationship secret or private. It may also allow members of an activist group to conceal their membership, or even conceal the existence of their group from authoritarian regimes. Furthermore, it may assist security agencies and counter terrorism units in understanding the strategies that covert organizations use to escape detection, and give rise to new strategy-proof countermeasures",

The challenge teaches skills such as computational modeling, probabilistic inference, efficiency vs. accuracy tradeoffs, debugging, parameter tuning, and benchmarking of algorithmic performance. Rather than allowing students to pursue any localization algorithm of their choosing, here, I propose a challenge structured around the particle filter family of algorithms. This additional scaffolding allows students at all levels to successfully implement one approach to the challenge, while providing enough flexibility and richness to enable students to pursue their own creative ideas. Additionally, I provide infrastructure for automatic evaluation of systems through the collection of ground truth robot location data via ceiling-mounted location tags that are automatically scanned using an upward facing camera attached to the robot. The robot and supporting hardware can be purchased for under $400 dollars, and the challenge can even be run without any robots at all using a set of recorded sensor traces",

This paper shares a small-footprint framework designed to make visual sensing as easy to incorporate into AI projects and assignments, e.g., as a source of evidence for localization algorithms, as range sensors. The framework leverages (hand-built) circular panoramas and the image-matching capabilities provided by OpenCV's python library. An example localization project highlights its pedagogical accessibility and ease of deployment atop low-cost hardware and alongside other sensors",

The user and the system interact via natural language to jointly plan and execute tasks involving building structures, with clarifications and demonstrations to teach the system along the way. We use the same architecture for building and simulating models of biology, demonstrating the general-purpose nature of the system where domain-specific knowledge is concentrated in sub-modules with the basic interaction remaining domain-independent. These capabilities are supported by our work on semantic parsing, which generates knowledge structures to be grounded in a physical representation, and composed with existing knowledge to create a dynamic plan for completing goals. Prior work on learning from natural language demonstrations enables learning of models from very few demonstrations, and features are extracted from definitions in natural language.

Existing systems for clinical concept extraction are mostly knowledge-driven, relying on exact match retrieval from original or lemmatized reports, and very few of them are scaled up to handle large volumes of complex, diverse data. In this demonstration we will showcase a new system for real-time detection of clinical concepts in EMR. The system features a large vocabulary of over 5.6 million concepts. It achieves high precision and recall, with good tolerance to typos through the use of a novel prefix indexing and subsequence matching algorithm, along with a recursive negation detector based on efficient, deep parsing. Our system has been tested on over 12.9 million reports of more than 200 different types, collected from 800,000+ patients. A comparison with the state of the art shows that it outperforms previous systems in addition to being the first system to scale to such large collections",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Organ transplants can improve the life expectancy and quality of life for the recipient but carry the risk of serious post-operative complications, such as septic shock and organ rejection. The probability of a successful transplant depends in a very subtle fashion on compatibility between the donor and the recipient - but current medical practice is short of domain knowledge regarding the complex nature of recipient-donor compatibility. Hence a data-driven approach for learning compatibility has the potential for significant improvements in match quality. This paper proposes a novel system (ConfidentMatch) that is trained using data from electronic health records. ConfidentMatch predicts the success of an organ transplant (in terms of the 3-year survival rates) on the basis of clinical and demographic traits of the donor and recipient. ConfidentMatch captures the heterogeneity of the donor and recipient traits by optimally dividing the feature space into clusters and constructing different optimal predictive models to each cluster. The system controls the complexity of the learned predictive model in a way that allows for assuring more granular and accurate predictions for a larger number of potential recipient-donor pairs, thereby ensuring that predictions are \"personalized\" and tailored to individual characteristics to the finest possible granularity. Experiments conducted on the UNOS heart transplant dataset show the superiority of the prognostic value of ConfidentMatch to other competing benchmarks; ConfidentMatch can provide predictions of success with 95% accuracy for 5,489 patients of a total population of 9,620 patients, which corresponds to 410 more patients than the most competitive benchmark algorithm (DeepBoost)",

    "abstract": "How to save labeling efforts for training supervised classifiers is an important research topic in machine learning community. Active learning (AL) and transfer learning (TL) are two useful tools to achieve this goal, and their combination, i.e., transfer active learning (T-AL) has also attracted considerable research interest. However, existing T-AL approaches consider to transfer knowledge from a source/auxiliary domain which has the same class labels as the target domain, but ignore the relationship among classes. In this paper, we investigate a more practical setting where the classes in source domain are related/similar to but different from the target domain classes. Specifically, we propose a novel cross-class T-AL approach to simultaneously transfer knowledge from source domain and actively annotate the most informative samples in target domain so that we can train satisfactory classifiers with as few labeled samples as possible. In particular, based on the class-class similarity and sample-sample similarity, we adopt a similarity propagation to find the source domain samples that can well capture the characteristics of a target class and then transfer the similar samples as the (pseudo) labeled data for the target class. In turn, the labeled and transferred samples are used to train classifiers and actively select new samples for annotation. Extensive experiments on three datasets demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms significantly the state-of-the-art related approaches",

    "abstract": "Low-rank matrix approximation has been widely used for data subspace clustering and feature representation in many computer vision and pattern recognition applications. However, in order to enhance the discriminability, most of the matrix approximation based feature extraction algorithms usually generate the cluster labels by certain clustering algorithm (e.g., the kmeans) and then perform the matrix approximation guided by such label information. In addition, the noises and outliers in the dataset with large reconstruction errors will easily dominate the objective function by the conventional ℓ2-norm based squared residue minimization. In this paper, we propose a novel clustering and feature extraction algorithm based on an unified low-rank matrix factorization framework, which suggests that the observed data matrix can be approximated by the production of projection matrix and low dimensional representation, among which the low-dimensional representation can be approximated by the cluster indicator and latent feature matrix simultaneously. Furthermore, we have proposed using the ℓ2,1-norm and integrating the manifold regularization to further promote the proposed model. A novel Augmented Lagrangian Method (ALM) based procedure is designed to effectively and efficiently seek the optimal solution of the problem. The experimental results in both clustering and feature extraction perspectives demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed method",

In more details, the proposed algorithm first constructs a feature network and a label network with marginalized linear denoising autoencoder in data feature set and label set, respectively, and then learns a robust predictor with the feature network and the label network regularization simultaneously. While DRML is a general method for multi-label learning, in the evaluations we focus on the specific application of multi-label text tagging.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Adverse drug reaction (ADR) is a major burden for patients and healthcare industry. It usually causes preventable hospitalizations and deaths, while associated with a huge amount of cost. Traditional preclinical in vitro safety profiling and clinical safety trials are restricted in terms of small scale, long duration, huge financial costs and limited statistical signifi- cance. The availability of large amounts of drug and ADR data potentially allows ADR predictions during the drugs' early preclinical stage with data analytics methods to inform more targeted clinical safety tests. Despite their initial success, existing methods have trade-offs among interpretability, predictive power and efficiency. This urges us to explore methods that could have all these strengths and provide practical solutions for real world ADR predictions. We cast the ADR-drug relation structure into a three-layer hierarchical Bayesian model. We interpret each ADR as a symbolic word and apply latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) to learn topics that may represent certain biochemical mechanism that relates ADRs with drug structures. Based on LDA, we designed an equivalent regularization term to incorporate the hierarchical ADR domain knowledge. Finally, we developed a mixed input model leveraging a fast collapsed Gibbs sampling method that the complexity of each iteration of Gibbs sampling proportional only to the number of positive ADRs. Experiments on real world data show our models achieved higher prediction accuracy and shorter running time than the state-of-the-art alternatives",

    "title": "Multitask Dyadic Prediction and Its Application in Prediction of Adverse Drug-Drug Interaction",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Adverse drug-drug interactions (DDIs) remain a leading cause of morbidity and mortality around the world. Identifying potential DDIs during the drug design process is critical in guiding targeted clinical drug safety testing. Although detection of adverse DDIs is conducted during Phase IV clinical trials, there are still a large number of new DDIs founded by accidents after the drugs were put on market. With the arrival of big data era, more and more pharmaceutical research and development data are becoming available, which provides an invaluable resource for digging insights that can potentially be leveraged in early prediction of DDIs. Many computational approaches have been proposed in recent years for DDI prediction. However, most of them focused on binary prediction (with or without DDI), despite the fact that each DDI is associated with a different type. Predicting the actual DDI type will help us better understand the DDI mechanism and identify proper ways to prevent it. In this paper, we formulate the DDI type prediction problem as a multitask dyadic regression problem, where the prediction of each specific DDI type is treated as a task. Compared with conventional matrix completion approaches which can only impute the missing entries in the DDI matrix, our approach can directly regress those dyadic relationships (DDIs) and thus can be extend to new drugs more easily. We developed an effective proximal gradient method to solve the problem. Evaluation on real world datasets is presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach",

    "abstract": "With benefits of low storage cost and fast query speed, cross-modal hashing has received considerable attention recently. However, almost all existing methods on cross-modal hashing cannot obtain powerful hash codes due to directly utilizing hand-crafted features or ignoring heterogeneous correlations across different modalities, which will greatly degrade the retrieval performance. In this paper, we propose a novel deep cross-modal hashing method to generate compact hash codes through an end-to-end deep learning architecture, which can effectively capture the intrinsic relationships between various modalities. Our architecture integrates different types of pairwise constraints to encourage the similarities of the hash codes from an intra-modal view and an inter-modal view, respectively. Moreover, additional decorrelation constraints are introduced to this architecture, thus enhancing the discriminative ability of each hash bit. Extensive experiments show that our proposed method yields state-of-the-art results on two cross-modal retrieval datasets",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Ensemble Clustering (EC) has gained a great deal of attention throughout the fields of data mining and machine learning, since it emerged as an effective and robust clustering framework. Typically, EC methods try to fuse multiple basic partitions (BPs) into a consensus one, of which each BP is obtained by performing traditional clustering method on the same dataset. One promising direction for ensemble clustering is to derive pairwise similarity from BPs, and then transform it as a graph partition problem. However, these graph based methods may suffer from an information loss when computing the similarity between data points, because they only utilize the categorical data provided by multiple BPs, yet neglect rich information from raw features. This problem can badly undermine the underlying cluster structure in the original feature space, and thus degrade the clustering performance. In light of this, we propose a novel Simultaneous Clustering and Ensemble (SCE) framework to alleviate such detrimental effect, which employs the similarity matrix from raw features to enhance the co-association matrix summarized by multiple BPs. Two neat closed-form solutions given by eigenvalue decomposition are provided for SCE. Experiments conducted on 16 real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed SCE over the traditional clustering and state-of-the-art ensemble clustering methods. Moreover, several impact factors that may affect our method are also explored extensively",

We take a fundamentally new approach in exploiting the class imbalance through a feature transformation such that the transformed features are easier to classify. Hypothesis testing is used for classification with a test statistic that follows the distribution of the difference of two chi-squared random variables, for which there are no analytic expressions and we derive an accurate approximation.

Individual patent information such as technology field, classification, claims, application jurisdictions are increasingly available as released by different venues. This work has relied on a long-standing hypothesis that the citation received by a patent is a proxy for knowledge flows or impacts of the patent thus is directly related to patent value. This paper does not fall into the line of intensive existing work that test or apply this hypothesis, rather we aim to address the limitation of using so-far received citations for patent valuation. By devising a point process based patent citation type aware (self-citation and non-self-citation) prediction model which incorporates the various information of a patent, we open up the possibility for performing predictive patent valuation which can be especially useful for newly granted patents with emerging technology. Study on real-world data corroborates the efficacy of our approach. Our initiative may also have policy implications for technology markets, patent systems and all other stakeholders.

Using image warping by the estimated flow, we devise a simple yet effective unsupervised method for learning optical flow, by directly minimizing photometric consistency.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Event sequence, asynchronously generated with random timestamp, is ubiquitous among applications. The precise and arbitrary timestamp can carry important clues about the underlying dynamics, and has lent the event data fundamentally different from the time-series whereby series is indexed with fixed and equal time interval. One expressive mathematical tool for modeling event is point process. The intensity functions of many point processes involve two components: the background and the effect by the history. Due to its inherent spontaneousness, the background can be treated as a time series while the other need to handle the history events. In this paper, we model the background by a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) with its units aligned with time series indexes while the history effect is modeled by another RNN whose units are aligned with asynchronous events to capture the long-range dynamics. The whole model with event type and timestamp prediction output layers can be trained end-to-end. Our approach takes an RNN perspective to point process, and models its background and history effect. For utility, our method allows a black-box treatment for modeling the intensity which is often a pre-defined parametric form in point processes. Meanwhile end-to-end training opens the venue for reusing existing rich techniques in deep network for point process modeling. We apply our model to the predictive maintenance problem using a log dataset by more than 1000 ATMs from a global bank headquartered in North America",

    "abstract": "The explosive growth of video content on the Web has been revolutionizing the way people share, exchange and perceive information, such as events. While an individual video usually concerns a specific aspect of an event, the videos that are uploaded by different users at different locations and times can embody different emphasis and compensate each other in describing the event. Combining these videos from different sources together can unveil a more complete picture of the event. Simply concatenating videos together is an intuitive solution, but it may degrade user experience since it is time-consuming and tedious to view those highly redundant, noisy and disorganized content. Therefore, we develop a novel approach, termed event video mashup (EVM), to automatically generate a unified short video from a collection of Web videos to describe the storyline of an event. We propose a submodular based content selection model that embodies both importance and diversity to depict the event from comprehensive aspects in an efficient way. Importantly, the video content is organized temporally and semantically conforming to the event evolution. We evaluate our approach on a real-world YouTube event dataset collected by ourselves.

In this paper, we present a novel method CDUE for time-aware item recommendation, which captures the evolution of both user's interests and item's contents information via topic dynamics. Specifically, we propose a dynamic sparse topic model to track the evolution of topics for changes in items' contents over time and adapt a vector autoregressive model to profile users' dynamic interests. The item's topics and user's interests and their evolutions are learned collaboratively and simultaneously into a unified learning framework.

However, the estimation errors in its input parameters substantially deteriorate its performance in practice. Specifically, loss could be huge when the number of assets for investment is not much smaller than the sample size of historical data. To hasten the applicability of Markowitz's portfolio optimization to large portfolios, in this paper, we propose a new portfolio strategy via subset resampling. Through resampling subsets of the original large universe of assets, we construct the associated subset portfolios with more accurately estimated parameters without requiring additional data. By aggregating a number of constructed subset portfolios, we attain a well-diversified portfolio of all assets. To investigate its performance, we first analyze its corresponding efficient frontiers by simulation, provide analysis on the hyperparameter selection, and then empirically compare its out-of-sample performance with those of various competing strategies on diversified datasets. Experimental results corroborate that the proposed portfolio strategy has marked superiority in extensive evaluation criteria",

By taking these two evidences into consideration, semantic segmentation is formulated as joint feature and label refinement over superpixels.

In this paper, we propose a new policy distillation architecture for deep reinforcement learning, where we assume that each task uses its task-specific high-level convolutional features as the inputs to the multi-task policy network. Furthermore, we propose a new sampling framework termed hierarchical prioritized experience replay to selectively choose experiences from the replay memories of each task domain to perform learning on the network.

We design an end-to-end structure of ST-ResNet based on unique properties of spatio-temporal data. More specifically, we employ the residual neural network framework to model the temporal closeness, period, and trend properties of crowd traffic. For each property, we design a branch of residual convolutional units, each of which models the spatial properties of crowd traffic. ST-ResNet learns to dynamically aggregate the output of the three residual neural networks based on data, assigning different weights to different branches and regions. The aggregation is further combined with external factors, such as weather and day of the week, to predict the final traffic of crowds in each and every region.

    "title": "Discriminative Semi-Supervised Dictionary Learning with Entropy Regularization for Pattern Classification",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Dictionary learning has played an important role in the success of sparse representation, which triggers the rapid developments of unsupervised and supervised dictionary learning methods. However, in most practical applications, there are usually quite limited labeled training samples while it is relatively easy to acquire abundant unlabeled training samples. Thus semi-supervised dictionary learning that aims to effectively explore the discrimination of unlabeled training data has attracted much attention of researchers. Although various regularizations have been introduced in the prevailing semi-supervised dictionary learning, how to design an effective unified model of dictionary learning and unlabeled-data class estimating and how to well explore the discrimination in the labeled and unlabeled data are still open. In this paper, we propose a novel discriminative semi-supervised dictionary learning model (DSSDL) by introducing discriminative representation, an identical coding of unlabeled data to the coding of testing data final classification, and an entropy regularization term. The coding strategy of unlabeled data can not only avoid the affect of its incorrect class estimation, but also make the learned discrimination be well exploited in the final classification. The introduced regularization of entropy can avoid overemphasizing on some uncertain estimated classes for unlabeled samples. Apart from the enhanced discrimination in the learned dictionary by the discriminative representation, an extended dictionary is used to mainly explore the discrimination embedded in the unlabeled data. Extensive experiments on face recognition, digit recognition and texture classification show the effectiveness of the proposed method",

It is a very important problem in computational advertising, as it allows marketers to assign credits for conversions to different advertising channels and optimize advertising campaigns.

In addition, we both take the conversion time and the intrinsic conversion rate of users into consideration.Experimental results on a large real-world advertising dataset illustrate that the our proposed method is superior to state-of-the-art techniques in conversion rate prediction and the credit allocation based on AMTA is reasonable",

    "abstract": "With the expansion of data, increasing imbalanced data has emerged. When the imbalance ratio of data is high, most existing imbalanced learning methods decline in classification performance. To address this problem, a few highly imbalanced learning methods have been presented. However, most of them are still sensitive to the high imbalance ratio. This work aims to provide an effective solution for the highly imbalanced data classification problem. We conduct highly imbalanced learning from the perspective of feature learning. We partition the majority class into multiple blocks with each being balanced to the minority class and combine each block with the minority class to construct a balanced sample set. Multiset feature learning (MFL) is performed on these sets to learn discriminant features. We thus propose an uncorrelated cost-sensitive multiset learning (UCML) approach. UCML provides a multiple sets construction strategy, incorporates the cost-sensitive factor into MFL, and designs a weighted uncorrelated constraint to remove the correlation among multiset features. Experiments on five highly imbalanced datasets indicate that: UCML outperforms state-of-the-art imbalanced learning methods",

Thus, a critical demand is to predict the difficulty of each test question before the test is conducted.

In this paper, we propose a novel Test-aware Attention-based Convolutional Neural Network (TACNN) framework to automatically solve this Question Difficulty Prediction (QDP) task for READING problems (a typical problem style in English tests) in standard tests. Specifically, given the abundant historical test logs and text materials of questions, we first design a CNN-based architecture to extract sentence representations for the questions. Then, we utilize an attention strategy to qualify the difficulty contribution of each sentence to questions. Considering the incomparability of question difficulties in different tests, we propose a test-dependent pairwise strategy for training TACNN and generating the difficulty prediction value. Extensive experiments on a real-world dataset not only show the effectiveness of TACNN, but also give interpretable insights to track the attention information for questions",

    "abstract": "Webpage classification has attracted a lot of research interest. Webpage data is often multi-view and high-dimensional, and the webpage classification application is usually semi-supervised. Due to these characteristics, using semi-supervised multi-view feature learning (SMFL) technique to deal with the webpage classification problem has recently received much attention. However, there still exists room for improvement for this kind of feature learning technique. How to effectively utilize the correlation information among multi-view of webpage data is an important research topic. Correlation analysis on multi-view data can facilitate extraction of the complementary information. In this paper, we propose a novel SMFL approach, named semi-supervised multi-view correlation feature learning (SMCFL), for webpage classification. SMCFL seeks for a discriminant common space by learning a multi-view shared transformation in a semi-supervised manner. In the discriminant space, the correlation between intra-class samples is maximized, and the correlation between inter-class samples and the global correlation among both labeled and unlabeled samples are minimized simultaneously. We transform the matrix-variable based nonconvex objective function of SMCFL into a convex quadratic programming problem with one real variable, and can achieve a global optimal solution.

    "abstract": "The problem of automatically fixing programming errors is a very active research topic in software engineering. This is a challenging problem as fixing even a single error may require analysis of the entire program. In practice, a number of errors arise due to programmer's inexperience with the programming language or lack of attention to detail. We call these common programming errors. These are analogous to grammatical errors in natural languages. Compilers detect such errors, but their error messages are usually inaccurate. In this work, we present an end-to-end solution, called DeepFix, that can fix multiple such errors in a program without relying on any external tool to locate or fix them. At the heart of DeepFix is a multi-layered sequence-to-sequence neural network with attention which is trained to predict erroneous program locations along with the required correct statements. On a set of 6971 erroneous C programs written by students for 93 programming tasks, DeepFix could fix 1881 (27%) programs completely and 1338 (19%) programs partially",

This paper addresses the expected risk minimization problem, in which expected risk can be bounded by the sum of optimization error and generalization error. Based on the uniform stability theory, we propose an expected risk minimized matrix approximation method (ERMMA), which is designed to achieve better tradeoff between optimization error and generalization error in order to reduce the expected risk of the learned MA models. Theoretical analysis shows that ERMMA can achieve lower expected risk bound than existing MA methods.

However, discovering essential activated brain sources associated with different brain status is still a challenging problem. In this study, we propose for the first time that the ill-posed EEG inverse problem can be formulated and solved as a sparse over-complete dictionary learning problem. In particular, a novel supervised sparse dictionary learning framework was developed for EEG source reconstruction. A revised version of discriminative K-SVD (DK-SVD) algorithm is exploited to solve the formulated supervised dictionary learning problem. As the proposed learning framework incorporated the EEG label information of different brain status, it is capable of learning a sparse representation that reveal the most discriminative brain activity sources among different brain states. Compared to the state-of-the-art EEG source analysis methods, proposed sparse dictionary learning framework achieved significant superior performance in both computing speed and accuracy for the challenging EEG source reconstruction problem through extensive numerical experiments. More importantly, the experimental results also validated that the proposed sparse learning framework is effective to discover the discriminative task-related brain activation sources, which shows the potential to advance the high resolution EEG source analysis for real-time non-invasive brain imaging research",

We propose a new source localization algorithm, named Optimal-Jordan-Cover (OJC).

Then, in the extracted subgraph, OJC finds a set of nodes that \"cover\" all observed infected nodes with the minimum radius. The set of nodes is called the Jordan cover, and is regarded as the set of diffusion sources. Considering the heterogeneous susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) diffusion in the Erdos-Renyi (ER) random graph, we prove that OJC can locate all sources with probability one asymptotically with partial observations. OJC is a polynomial-time algorithm in terms of network size. However, the computational complexity increases exponentially in m; the number of sources. We further propose a low-complexity heuristic based on the K-Means for approximating the Jordan cover, named Approximate-Jordan-Cover (AJC).

Traditional CF-based methods employ the user-item matrix which encodes the individual preferences of users for items for learning to make recommendation. In real applications, the rating matrix is usually very sparse, causing CF-based methods to degrade significantly in recommendation performance. In this case, some improved CF methods utilize the increasing amount of side information to address the data sparsity problem as well as the cold start problem. However, the learned latent factors may not be effective due to the sparse nature of the user-item matrix and the side information. To address this problem, we utilize advances of learning effective representations in deep learning, and propose a hybrid model which jointly performs deep users and items' latent factors learning from side information and collaborative filtering from the rating matrix. Extensive experimental results on three real-world datasets show that our hybrid model outperforms other methods in effectively utilizing side information and achieves performance improvement",

    "abstract": "Metric learning has been widely employed, especially in various computer vision tasks, with the fundamental assumption that all samples (e.g., regions/superpixels in images/videos) are independent and identically distributed (IID). However, since the samples are usually spatially-connected or temporally-correlated with their physically-connected neighbours, they are not IID (non-IID for short), which cannot be directly handled by existing methods. Thus, we propose to learn and integrate non-IID metrics (NIME). To incorporate the non-IID spatial/temporal relations, instead of directly using non-IID features and metric learning as previous methods, NIME first builds several non-IID representations on original (non-IID) features by various graph kernel functions, and then automatically learns the metric under the best combination of various non-IID representations. NIME is applied to solve two typical computer vision tasks: interactive image segmentation and histology image identification. The results show that learning and integrating non-IID metrics improves the performance, compared to the IID methods. Moreover, our method achieves results comparable or better than that of the state-of-the-arts",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS) is extremely popular in computer Go which determines each action by enormous simulations in a broad and deep search tree. However, human experts select most actions by pattern analysis and careful evaluation rather than brute search of millions of future interactions. In this paper, we propose a computer Go system that follows experts' way of thinking and playing. Our system consists of two parts. The first part is a novel deep alternative neural network (DANN) used to generate candidates of next move. Compared with existing deep convolutional neural network (DCNN), DANN inserts recurrent layer after each convolutional layer and stacks them in an alternative manner. We show such setting can preserve more contexts of local features and its evolutions which are beneficial for move prediction. The second part is a long-term evaluation (LTE) module used to provide a reliable evaluation of candidates rather than a single probability from move predictor. This is consistent with human experts' nature of playing since they can foresee tens of steps to give an accurate estimation of candidates. In our system, for each candidate, LTE calculates a cumulative reward after several future interactions when local variations are settled. Combining criteria from the two parts, our system determines the optimal choice of next move. For more comprehensive experiments, we introduce a new professional Go dataset (PGD), consisting of $253,233$ professional records. Experiments on GoGoD and PGD datasets show the DANN can substantially improve performance of move prediction over pure DCNN. When combining LTE, our system outperforms most relevant approaches and open engines based on MCTS",

    "abstract": "Company profiling is an analytical process to build an in-depth understanding of company's fundamental characteristics. It serves as an effective way to gain vital information of the target company and acquire business intelligence. Traditional approaches for company profiling rely heavily on the availability of rich finance information about the company, such as finance reports and SEC filings, which may not be readily available for many private companies. However, the rapid prevalence of online employment services enables a new paradigm — to obtain the variety of company's information from their employees' online ratings and comments. This, in turn, raises the challenge to develop company profiles from an employee's perspective. To this end, in this paper, we propose a method named Company Profiling based Collaborative Topic Regression (CPCTR), for learning the latent structural patterns of companies. By formulating a joint optimization framework, CPCTR has the ability in collaboratively modeling both textual (e.g., reviews) and numerical information (e.g., salaries and ratings). Indeed, with the identified patterns, including the positive/negative opinions and the latent variable that influences salary, we can effectively carry out opinion analysis and salary prediction. Extensive experiments were conducted on a real-world data set to validate the effectiveness of CPCTR. The results show that our method provides a comprehensive understanding of company characteristics and delivers a more effective prediction of salaries than other baselines",

However, ensemble learning suffers from lower efficiency due to the increased overall computation overhead. In this paper, we propose GLOMA, a new clustering-based matrix approximation method, which can embed global information in local matrix approximation models to improve recommendation accuracy. In GLOMA, a MA model is first trained on the entire data to capture global information. The global MA model is then utilized to guide the training of cluster-based local MA models, such that the local models can detect strong localized associations shared within clusters and at the same time preserve global associations shared among all users/items. Evaluation results using MovieLens and Netflix datasets demonstrate that, by integrating global information in local models, GLOMA can outperform five state-of-the-art MA-based CF methods in recommendation accuracy while achieving descent efficiency",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "With the rapid growth of online sharing media, we are facing a huge collection of videos. In the meantime, due to the volume and complexity of video data, it can be tedious and time consuming to index or annotate videos. In this paper, we propose to generate temporal descriptions of videos by exploiting the information of crowdsourced time-sync comments which are receiving increasing popularity on many video sharing websites. In this framework, representative and interesting comments of a video are selected and highlighted along the timeline, which provide an informative description of the video in a time-sync manner. The challenge of the proposed application comes from the extremely informal and noisy nature of the comments, which are usually short sentences and on very different topics. To resolve these issues, we propose a novel temporal summarization model based on the data reconstruction principle, where representative comments are selected in order to best reconstruct the original corpus at the text level as well as the topic level while incorporating the temporal correlations of the comments. Experimental results on real-world data demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework and justify the idea of exploiting crowdsourced time-sync comments as a bridge to describe videos",

    "abstract": "Sports broadcasters are continuously seeking to make their live coverages of soccer matches more attractive. A recent innovation is the \"highlight channel,\" which shows the most interesting events from multiple matches played at the same time. However, switching between matches at the right time is challenging in fast-paced sports like soccer, where interesting situations often evolve as quickly as they disappear again. This paper presents the POGBA algorithm for automatically predicting highlights in soccer matches, which is an important task that has not yet been addressed. POGBA leverages spatio-temporal event streams collected during matches to predict the probability that a particular game state will lead to a goal. An empirical evaluation on a real-world dataset shows that POGBA outperforms the baseline algorithms in terms of both precision and recall",

    "abstract": "Understanding the nature of dark energy, the mysterious force driving the accelerated expansion of the Universe, is a major challenge of modern cosmology. The next generation of cosmological surveys, specifically designed to address this issue, rely on accurate measurements of the apparent shapes of distant galaxies. However, shape measurement methods suffer from various unavoidable biases and therefore will rely on a precise calibration to meet the accuracy requirements of the science analysis. This calibration process remains an open challenge as it requires large sets of high quality galaxy images. To this end, we study the application of deep conditional generative models in generating realistic galaxy images. In particular we consider variations on conditional variational autoencoder and introduce a new adversarial objective for training of conditional generative networks. Our results suggest a reliable alternative to the acquisition of expensive high quality observations for generating the calibration data needed by the next generation of cosmological surveys",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Recent years have witnessed an extensive popularity of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in various computer vision and artificial intelligence applications. However, the performance gains have come at a cost of substantially intensive computation complexity, which prohibits its usage inresource-limited applications like mobile or embedded devices. While increasing attention has been paid to the acceleration of internal network structure, the redundancy of visual input is rarely considered. In this paper, we make the first attempt of reducing spatial and channel redundancy directly from the visual input for CNNs acceleration. The proposed method, termed ESPACE (Elimination of SPAtial and Channel rEdundancy), works by the following three steps: First, the 3D channel redundancy of convolutional layers is reduced by a set of low-rank approximation of convolutional filters. Second, a novel mask based selective processing scheme is proposed, which further speedups the convolution operations via skipping unsalient spatial locations of the visual input. Third, the accelerated network is fine-tuned using the training data via back-propagation. The proposed method is evaluated on ImageNet 2012 with implementations on two widely adopted CNNs, i.e. AlexNet and GoogLeNet. In comparison to several recent methods of CNN acceleration, the proposed scheme has demonstrated new state-of-the-art acceleration performance by a factor of 5.48* and 4.12* speedup on AlexNet and GoogLeNet, respectively, with a minimal decrease in classification accuracy",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we consider the problem of predicting demographics of geographic units given geotagged Tweets that are composed within these units. Traditional survey methods that offer demographics estimates are usually limited in terms of geographic resolution, geographic boundaries, and time intervals. Thus, it would be highly useful to develop computational methods that can complement traditional survey methods by offering demographics estimates at finer geographic resolutions, with flexible geographic boundaries (i.e. not confined to administrative boundaries), and at different time intervals. While prior work has focused on predicting demographics and health statistics at relatively coarse geographic resolutions such as the county-level or state-level, we introduce an approach to predict demographics at finer geographic resolutions such as the blockgroup-level. For the task of predicting gender and race/ethnicity counts at the blockgroup-level, an approach adapted from prior work to our problem achieves an average correlation of 0.389 (gender) and 0.569 (race) on a held-out test dataset. Our approach outperforms this prior approach with an average correlation of 0.671 (gender) and 0.692 (race)",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "The cold-start problem involves recommendation of content to new users of a system, for whom there is no historical preference information available. This proves a challenge for collaborative filtering algorithms that inherently rely on such information. Recent work has shown that social metadata, such as users' friend groups and page likes, can strongly mitigate the problem. However, such approaches either lack an interpretation as optimising some principled objective, involve iterative non-convex optimisation with limited scalability, or require tuning several hyperparameters. In this paper, we first show how three popular cold-start models are special cases of a linear content-based model, with implicit constraints on the weights. Leveraging this insight, we propose Loco, a new model for cold-start recommendation based on three ingredients: (a) linear regression to learn an optimal weighting of social signals for preferences, (b) a low-rank parametrisation of the weights to overcome the high dimensionality common in social data, and (c) scalable learning of such low-rank weights using randomised SVD. Experiments on four real-world datasets show that Loco yields significant improvements over state-of-the-art cold-start recommenders that exploit high-dimensional social network metadata",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Deep Residual Networks (ResNets) have recently achieved state-of-the-art results on many challenging computer vision tasks. In this work we analyze the role of Batch Normalization (BatchNorm) layers on ResNets in the hope of improving the current architecture and better incorporating other normalization techniques, such as Normalization Propagation (NormProp), into ResNets. Firstly, we verify that BatchNorm helps distribute representation learning to residual blocks at all layers, as opposed to a plain ResNet without BatchNorm where learning happens mostly in the latter part of the network. We also observe that BatchNorm well regularizes Concatenated ReLU (CReLU) activation scheme on ResNets, whose magnitude of activation grows by preserving both positive and negative responses when going deeper into the network. Secondly, we investigate the use of NormProp as a replacement for BatchNorm in ResNets. Though NormProp theoretically attains the same effect as BatchNorm on generic convolutional neural networks, the identity mapping of ResNets invalidates its theoretical promise and NormProp exhibits a significant performance drop when naively applied. To bridge the gap between BatchNorm and NormProp in ResNets, we propose a simple modification to NormProp and employ the CReLU activation scheme. We experiment on visual object recognition benchmark datasets such as CIFAR-10/100 and ImageNet and demonstrate that 1) the modified NormProp performs better than the original NormProp but is still not comparable to BatchNorm and 2) CReLU improves the performance of ResNets with or without normalizations",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Automatic generation of natural language description for individual images (a.k.a. image captioning) has attracted extensive research attention. In this paper, we take one step further to investigate the generation of a paragraph to describe a photo stream for the purpose of storytelling. This task is even more challenging than individual image description due to the difficulty in modeling the large visual variance in an ordered photo collection and in preserving the long-term language coherence among multiple sentences. To deal with these challenges, we formulate the task as a sequence-to-sequence learning problem and propose a novel joint learning model by leveraging the semantic coherence in a photo stream. Specifically, to reduce visual variance, we learn a semantic space by jointly embedding each photo with its corresponding contextual sentence, so that the semantically related photos and their correlations are discovered. Then, to preserve language coherence in the paragraph, we learn a novel Bidirectional Attention-based Recurrent Neural Network (BARNN) model, which can attend on the discovered semantic relation to produce a sentence sequence and maintain its consistence with the photo stream. We integrate the two-step learning components into one single optimization formulation and train the network in an end-to-end manner. Experiments on three widely-used datasets (NYC/Disney/SIND) show that the proposed approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods with large margins for both retrieval and paragraph generation tasks. We also show the subjective preference of the machine-generated stories by the proposed approach over the baselines through a user study with 40 human subjects",

    "abstract": "Boundary incompleteness raises great challenges to automatic prostate segmentation in ultrasound images. Shape prior can provide strong guidance in estimating the missing boundary, but traditional shape models often suffer from hand-crafted descriptors and local information loss in the fitting procedure. In this paper, we attempt to address those issues with a novel framework. The proposed framework can seamlessly integrate feature extraction and shape prior exploring, and estimate the complete boundary with a sequential manner. Our framework is composed of three key modules. Firstly, we serialize the static 2D prostate ultrasound images into dynamic sequences and then predict prostate shapes by sequentially exploring shape priors. Intuitively, we propose to learn the shape prior with the biologically plausible Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs). This module is corroborated to be effective in dealing with the boundary incompleteness. Secondly, to alleviate the bias caused by different serialization manners, we propose a multi-view fusion strategy to merge shape predictions obtained from different perspectives. Thirdly, we further implant the RNN core into a multiscale Auto-Context scheme to successively refine the details of the shape prediction map. With extensive validation on challenging prostate ultrasound images, our framework bridges severe boundary incompleteness and achieves the best performance in prostate boundary delineation when compared with several advanced methods. Additionally, our approach is general and can be extended to other medical image segmentation tasks, where boundary incompleteness is one of the main challenges",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "With the emergence of online forums associated with major diseases, such as diabetes mellitus, many patients are increasingly dependent on such disease-specific social networks to gain access to additional resources. Among these patients, it is common for them to stick to one disease-specific social network, although their desired resources might be spread over multiple social networks, such as patients with similar questions and concerns. Motivated by this application, in this paper, we focus on cross network link recommendation, which aims to identify similar users across multiple heterogeneous social networks. The problem setting is different from existing work on cross network link prediction, which either tries to link accounts of the same user from different social networks, or aims to match users with complementary expertise or interest. To approach the problem of cross network link recommendation, we propose to jointly decompose the user-keyword matrices from multiple social networks, while requiring them to share the same topics and user group-topic association matrices. This constraint comes from the fact that social networks dedicated to the same disease tend to share the same topics as well as the interests of users groups in certain topics. Based on this intuition, we construct a generic optimization framework, provide four instantiations and an iterative optimization algorithm with performance analysis. In the experiments, we demonstrate the superiority of the proposed algorithm over state-of-the-art techniques on various real-world data sets",

    "abstract": "Personalized ranking is usually considered as an ultimate goal of recommendation systems, but it suffers from efficiency issues when making recommendations. To this end, we propose a learning-based hashing framework called Discrete Personalized Ranking (DPR), to map users and items to a Hamming space, where user-item affinity can be efficiently calculated via Hamming distance. Due to the existence of discrete constraints, it is possible to exploit a two-stage learning procedure for learning binary codes according to most existing methods. This two-stage procedure consists of relaxed optimization by discarding discrete constraints and subsequent binary quantization. However, such a procedure has been shown resulting in a large quantization loss, so that longer binary codes would be required. To this end, DPR directly tackles the discrete optimization problem of personalized ranking. And the balance and un-correlation constraints of binary codes are imposed to derive compact but informatics binary codes. Based on the evaluation on several datasets, the proposed framework shows consistent superiority to the competing baselines even though only using shorter binary code",

    "abstract": "Accurate assessment of the severity of a patient's condition plays a fundamental role in acute hospital care such as that provided in an intensive care unit (ICU). ICU clinicians are required to make sense of a large amount of clinical data in a limited time to estimate the severity of a patient's condition, which ultimately leads to the planning of appropriate care. The ICU is an especially demanding environment for clinicians because of the diversity of patients who mostly suffer from multiple diseases of various types. In this paper, we propose a mortality risk prediction method for ICU patients. The method is intended to enhance the severity assessment by considering the diversity of patients. Our method produces patient-specific risk models that reflect the collection of diseases associated with the patient. Specifically, we assume a small number of latent basis tasks, where each latent task is associated with its own parameter vector; a parameter vector for a specific patient is constructed as a linear combination of these. The latent representation of a patient, namely, the coefficients of the combination, is learned based on the collection of diseases associated with the patient. Our method could be considered a multi-task learning method where latent tasks are learned based on the collection of diseases. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method using a dataset collected from a hospital. Our method achieved higher predictive performance compared with a single-task learning method, the \"de facto standard,\" and several multi-task learning methods including a recently proposed method for ICU mortality risk prediction. Furthermore, our proposed method could be used not only for predictions but also for uncovering patient-specificity from different viewpoints",

We focus specifically on Bob's optimal defense actions to limit Alice's effectiveness. We define a general framework for determining Bob's optimal defense action against Alice's worst-case attack. We then demonstrate our framework by considering linear predictors, where we provide tractable methods of determining the optimal defense action. Using these methods, we perform an empirical investigation of optimal defense actions for a particular class of linear models -- autoregressive forecasters -- and find that for ten real world futures markets, the optimal defense action reduces the Bob's loss by between 78 and 97%",

To alleviate this problem, we propose a novel encoder-decoder-reconstructor framework for NMT.

In recent years, a number of knowledge-based topic models have been proposed, but they could not process fact-oriented triple knowledge in knowledge graphs. Knowledge graph embeddings, on the other hand, automatically capture relations between entities in knowledge graphs. In this paper, we propose a novel knowledge-based topic model by incorporating knowledge graph embeddings into topic modeling. By combining latent Dirichlet allocation, a widely used topic model with knowledge encoded by entity vectors, we improve the semantic coherence significantly and capture a better representation of a document in the topic space.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Knowledge graph embedding represents entities and relations in knowledge graph as low-dimensional, continuous vectors, and thus enables knowledge graph compatible with machine learning models. Though there have been a variety of models for knowledge graph embedding, most methods merely concentrate on the fact triples, while supplementary textual descriptions of entities and relations have not been fully employed. To this end, this paper proposes the semantic space projection (SSP) model which jointly learns from the symbolic triples and textual descriptions. Our model builds interaction between the two information sources, and employs textual descriptions to discover semantic relevance and offer precise semantic embedding. Extensive experiments show that our method achieves substantial improvements against baselines on the tasks of knowledge graph completion and entity classification",

We first propose context guided n-gram representation by adding n-grams to word embeddings model. However, the context guided learning strategy of word embeddings is likely to miss some semantics for text-level tasks. Text guided n-gram representation and label guided n-gram representation are proposed to capture more semantics like topic or sentiment tendencies. Neural-BoN with the latter two n-gram representations achieve state-of-the-art results on 4 document-level classification datasets and 6 semantic relatedness categories. They are also on par with some sophisticated DNNs on 3 sentence-level classification datasets. Similar to traditional BoN, Neural-BoN is efficient, robust and easy to implement.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "One of the main goals of natural language processing (NLP) is synthetic understanding of natural language documents, especially reading comprehension (RC). An obstacle to the further development of RC systems is the absence of a synthetic methodology to analyze their performance. It is difficult to examine the performance of systems based solely on their results for tasks because the process of natural language understanding is complex. In order to tackle this problem, we propose in this paper a methodology inspired by unit testing in software engineering that enables the examination of RC systems from multiple aspects. Our methodology consists of three steps. First, we define a set of prerequisite skills for RC based on existing NLP tasks. We assume that RC capability can be divided into these skills. Second, we manually annotate a dataset for an RC task with information regarding the skills needed to answer each question. Finally, we analyze the performance of RC systems for each skill based on the annotation. The last two steps highlight two aspects: the characteristics of the dataset, and the weaknesses in and differences among RC systems. We tested the effectiveness of our methodology by annotating the Machine Comprehension Test (MCTest) dataset and analyzing four existing systems (including a neural system) on it. The results of the annotations showed that answering questions requires a combination of skills, and clarified the kinds of capabilities that systems need to understand natural language. We conclude that the set of prerequisite skills we define are promising for the decomposition and analysis of RC",

This paper presents the concept of Unit Dependency Graphs (UDGs), which provides a compact representation of the dependencies between units of numbers mentioned in a given problem. Inducing the UDG alleviates the brittleness of the unit extraction system and allows for a natural way to leverage domain knowledge about unit compatibility, for word problem solving. We introduce a decomposed model for inducing UDGs with minimal additional annotations, and use it to augment the expressions used in the arithmetic word problem solver of (Roy and Roth 2015) via a constrained inference framework. We show that introduction of UDGs reduces the error of the solver by over 10 %, surpassing all existing systems for solving arithmetic word problems. In addition, it also makes the system more robust to adaptation to new vocabulary and equation forms",

    "abstract": "Recognizing lexical entailment (RLE) always plays an important role in inference of natural language, i.e., identifying whether one word entails another, for example, fox entails animal. In the literature, automatically recognizing lexical entailment for word pairs deeply relies on words' contextual representations. However, as a \"prototype\" vector, a single representation cannot reveal multifaceted aspects of the words due to their homonymy and polysemy. In this paper, we propose a supervised Context-Enriched Neural Network (CENN) method for recognizing lexical entailment. To be specific, we first utilize multiple embedding vectors from different contexts to represent the input word pairs. Then, through different combination methods and attention mechanism, we integrate different embedding vectors and optimize their weights to predict whether there are entailment relations in word pairs. Moreover, our proposed framework is flexible and open to handle different word contexts and entailment perspectives in the text corpus. Extensive experiments on five datasets show that our approach significantly improves the performance of automatic RLE in comparison with several state-of-the-art methods",

    "abstract": "We propose a new active learning (AL) method for text classification with convolutional neural networks (CNNs). In AL, one selects the instances to be manually labeled with the aim of maximizing model performance with minimal effort. Neural models capitalize on word embeddings as representations (features), tuning these to the task at hand. We argue that AL strategies for multi-layered neural models should focus on selecting instances that most affect the embedding space (i.e., induce discriminative word representations). This is in contrast to traditional AL approaches (e.g., entropy-based uncertainty sampling), which specify higher level objectives. We propose a simple approach for sentence classification that selects instances containing words whose embeddings are likely to be updated with the greatest magnitude, thereby rapidly learning discriminative, task-specific embeddings. We extend this approach to document classification by jointly considering: (1) the expected changes to the constituent word representations; and (2) the model's current overall uncertainty regarding the instance. The relative emphasis placed on these criteria is governed by a stochastic process that favors selecting instances likely to improve representations at the outset of learning, and then shifts toward general uncertainty sampling as AL progresses. Empirical results show that our method outperforms baseline AL approaches on both sentence and document classification tasks. We also show that, as expected, the method quickly learns discriminative word embeddings. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work on AL addressing neural models for text classification",

    "abstract": "In lexicon-based classification, documents are assigned labels by comparing the number of words that appear from two opposed lexicons, such as positive and negative sentiment. Creating such words lists is often easier than labeling instances, and they can be debugged by non-experts if classification performance is unsatisfactory. However, there is little analysis or justification of this classification heuristic. This paper describes a set of assumptions that can be used to derive a probabilistic justification for lexicon-based classification, as well as an analysis of its expected accuracy. One key assumption behind lexicon-based classification is that all words in each lexicon are equally predictive. This is rarely true in practice, which is why lexicon-based approaches are usually outperformed by supervised classifiers that learn distinct weights on each word from labeled instances. This paper shows that it is possible to learn such weights without labeled data, by leveraging co-occurrence statistics across the lexicons. This offers the best of both worlds: light supervision in the form of lexicons, and data-driven classification with higher accuracy than traditional word-counting heuristics",

In this study, we proposed a deterministic attention mechanism that deterministically selects the important context and is not affected by the sequence length.

    "abstract": "Language processing mechanism by humans is generally more robust than computers. The Cmabrigde Uinervtisy (Cambridge University) effect from the psycholinguistics literature has demonstrated such a robust word processing mechanism, where jumbled words (e.g. Cmabrigde / Cambridge) are recognized with little cost. On the other hand, computational models for word recognition (e.g. spelling checkers) perform poorly on data with such noise. Inspired by the findings from the Cmabrigde Uinervtisy effect, we propose a word recognition model based on a semi-character level recurrent neural network (scRNN). In our experiments, we demonstrate that scRNN has significantly more robust performance in word spelling correction (i.e. word recognition) compared to existing spelling checkers and character-based convolutional neural network. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the model is cognitively plausible by replicating a psycholinguistics experiment about human reading difficulty using our model",

As conventional maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) is prone to focus on explaining irrelevant but common correlations in data, we apply maximum reconstruction estimation (MRE) to learning generative latent-variable models alternatively, which aims to find model parameters that maximize the probability of reconstructing the observed data. We develop tractable algorithms to directly learn hidden Markov models and IBM translation models using the MRE criterion, without the need to introduce a separate reconstruction model to facilitate efficient inference.

To fill this gap, we propose a Recurrent Attentional Topic Model (RATM) for document embedding. The RATM not only takes advantage of the sequential orders among sentence but also use the attention mechanism to model the relations among successive sentences.

    "abstract": "The task of aspect and opinion terms co-extraction aims to explicitly extract aspect terms describing features of an entity and opinion terms expressing emotions from user-generated texts. To achieve this task, one effective approach is to exploit relations between aspect terms and opinion terms by parsing syntactic structure for each sentence. However, this approach requires expensive effort for parsing and highly depends on the quality of the parsing results. In this paper, we offer a novel deep learning model, named coupled multi-layer attentions. The proposed model provides an end-to-end solution and does not require any parsers or other linguistic resources for preprocessing. Specifically, the proposed model is a multi-layer attention network, where each layer consists of a couple of attentions with tensor operators. One attention is for extracting aspect terms, while the other is for extracting opinion terms. They are learned interactively to dually propagate information between aspect terms and opinion terms. Through multiple layers, the model can further exploit indirect relations between terms for more precise information extraction. Experimental results on three benchmark datasets in SemEval Challenge 2014 and 2015 show that our model achieves state-of-the-art performances compared with several baselines",

However, recent studies show that NMT generally produces fluent but inadequate translations (Tu et al. 2016b; 2016a; He et al. 2016; Tu et al. 2017). This is in contrast to conventional Statistical Machine Translation (SMT), which usually yields adequate but non-fluent translations. It is natural, therefore, to leverage the advantages of both models for better translations, and in this work we propose to incorporate SMT model into NMT framework. More specifically, at each decoding step, SMT offers additional recommendations of generated words based on the decoding information from NMT (e.g., the generated partial translation and attention history). Then we employ an auxiliary classifier to score the SMT recommendations and a gating function to combine the SMT recommendations with NMT generations, both of which are jointly trained within the NMT architecture in an end-to-end manner. Experimental results on Chinese-English translation show that the proposed approach achieves significant and consistent improvements over state-of-the-art NMT and SMT systems on multiple NIST test sets",

Previous generative conversational models ignore these 1-to-n relationships between a post to its diverse responses, and tend to return high-frequency but meaningless responses. In this study we propose a mechanism-aware neural machine for dialogue response generation. It assumes that there exists some latent responding mechanisms, each of which can generate different responses for a single input post. With this assumption we model different responding mechanisms as latent embeddings, and develop a encoder-diverter-decoder framework to train its modules in an end-to-end fashion. With the learned latent mechanisms, for the first time these decomposed modules can be used to encode the input into mechanism-aware context, and decode the responses with the controlled generation styles and topics. Finally, the experiments with human judgements, intuitive examples, detailed discussions demonstrate the quality and diversity of the generated responses with 9.80% increase of acceptable ratio over the best of six baseline methods",

We propose a unified model which can learn from out-of-domain corpora and in-domain unannotated texts. The unified model contains two major functions. One is for cross-domain learning and another for semi-supervised learning. Cross-domain learning function can learn out-of-domain information based on domain similarity.

To combine the two decoders and determine the final output, we develop a predictor to predict the mode of copying or rewriting.

This mapping allows them to effectively leverage the information contained in large, formal knowledge bases (KBs, e.g., Freebase) to answer questions, but it is also fundamentally limiting---these semantic parsers can only assign meaning to language that falls within the KB's manually-produced schema. Recently proposed methods for open vocabulary semantic parsing overcome this limitation by learning execution models for arbitrary language, essentially using a text corpus as a kind of knowledge base. However, all prior approaches to open vocabulary semantic parsing replace a formal KB with textual information, making no use of the KB in their models. We show how to combine the disparate representations used by these two approaches, presenting for the first time a semantic parser that (1) produces compositional, executable representations of language, (2) can successfully leverage the information contained in both a formal KB and a large corpus, and (3) is not limited to the schema of the underlying KB.

The joint attention mechanism summarizes the hidden vectors of an input message as context vectors by message attention and synthesizes topic vectors by topic attention from the topic words of the message obtained from a pre-trained LDA model, with these vectors jointly affecting the generation of words in decoding. To increase the possibility of topic words appearing in responses, the model modifies the generation probability of topic words by adding an extra probability item to bias the overall distribution.

The coarse sequences can also incorporate task-specific knowledge, when available. In our experiments, the coarse sequences are extracted using automatic procedures, which are designed to capture compositional structure and semantics.

Most of the existing models are in fact good at capturing the relatedness among words rather than their ''genuine'' similarity because the context representations are often represented by a sum (or an average) of the neighbor's embeddings, which simplifies the computation but ignores an important fact that the meaning of a word is determined by its context, reflecting not only the surrounding words but also the rules used to combine them (i.e. compositionality). On the other hand, much effort has been devoted to learning a single-prototype representation per word, which is problematic because many words are polysemous, and a single-prototype model is incapable of capturing phenomena of homonymy and polysemy. We present a neural network architecture to jointly learn word embeddings and context representations from large data sets. The explicitly produced context representations are further used to learn context-specific and multi-prototype word embeddings.

The method is however unreliable when there are only a limited number of seeds, which is a reasonable setting for resource-scarce languages. We tackle the limitation by introducing a novel matching mechanism into bilingual word representation learning. It captures extra translation pairs exposed by the seeds to incrementally improve the bilingual word embeddings.

    "abstract": "To compare the similarity of probability distributions, the information-theoretically motivated metrics like Kullback-Leibler divergence (KL) and Jensen-Shannon divergence (JSD) are often more reasonable compared with metrics for vectors like Euclidean and angular distance. However, existing locality-sensitive hashing (LSH) algorithms cannot support the information-theoretically motivated metrics for probability distributions. In this paper, we first introduce a new approximation formula for S2JSD-distance, and then propose a novel LSH scheme adapted to S2JSD-distance for approximate nearest neighbors search in high-dimensional probability distributions. We define the specific hashing functions, and prove their local-sensitivity. Furthermore, extensive empirical evaluations well illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed hashing schema on six public image datasets and two text datasets, in terms of mean Average Precision, Precision@N and Precision-Recall curve",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Maximum Entropy (ME), as a general-purpose machine learning model, has been successfully applied to various fields such as text mining and natural language processing. It has been used as a classification technique and recently also applied to learn word embedding. ME establishes a distribution of the exponential form over items (classes/words). When training such a model, learning efficiency is guaranteed by globally updating the entire set of model parameters associated with all items at each training instance. This creates a significant computational challenge when the number of items is large. To achieve learning efficiency with affordable computational cost, we propose an approach named Dual-Clustering Maximum Entropy (DCME). Exploiting the primal-dual form of ME, it conducts clustering in the dual space and approximates each dual distribution by the corresponding cluster center. This naturally enables a hybrid online-offline optimization algorithm whose time complexity per instance only scales as the product of the feature/word vector dimensionality and the cluster number. Experimental studies on text classification and word embedding learning demonstrate that DCME effectively strikes a balance between training speed and model quality, substantially outperforming state-of-the-art methods",

Then we provide a new stochastic gradient based method to update all the word vectors and parameters, by comparing the old tree generated based on the old corpus and the new tree generated based on the combined (old and update) corpus. Theoretical analysis shows that the mean square error of the parameter vectors can be bounded by a function of the number of changed words related to the parameter node. Experimental results show that incremental training can save a lot of time. The smaller the update corpus is, the faster the update training process is, where an up to 30 times speedup has been achieved.

Most of the current deep neural network (DNN) based methods consider these tasks as a sequence labeling problem, in which a word, rather than a chunk, is treated as the basic unit for labeling. These chunks are then inferred by the standard IOB (Inside-Outside- Beginning) labels. In this paper, we propose an alternative approach by investigating the use of DNN for sequence chunking, and propose three neural models so that each chunk can be treated as a complete unit for labeling.

Currently, most of the existing works study the problem of question answering based on the deep semantic matching model to rank the answers based on their semantic relevance, while ignoring the authority of answerers to the given question. In this paper, we consider the problem of community-based question answering from the viewpoint of asymmetric multi-faceted ranking network embedding. We propose a novel asymmetric multi-faceted ranking network learning framework for community-based question answering by jointly exploiting the deep semantic relevance between question-answer pairs and the answerers' authority to the given question. We then develop an asymmetric ranking network learning method with deep recurrent neural networks by integrating both answers' relative quality rank to the given question and the answerers' following relations in CQA sites. The extensive experiments on a large-scale dataset from a real world CQA site show that our method achieves better performance than other state-of-the-art solutions to the problem",

    "abstract": "Structural correspondence learning (SCL) is an effective method for cross-lingual sentiment classification. This approach uses unlabeled documents along with a word translation oracle to automatically induce task specific, cross-lingual correspondences. It transfers knowledge through identifying important features, i.e., pivot features. For simplicity, however, it assumes that the word translation oracle maps each pivot feature in source language to exactly only one word in target language. This one-to-one mapping between words in different languages is too strict. Also the context is not considered at all. In this paper, we propose a cross-lingual SCL based on distributed representation of words; it can learn meaningful one-to-many mappings for pivot words using large amounts of monolingual data and a small dictionary. We conduct experiments on NLP&CC 2013 cross-lingual sentiment analysis dataset, employing English as source language, and Chinese as target language.

    "title": "Unsupervised Sentiment Analysis with Signed Social Networks",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Huge volumes of opinion-rich data is user-generated in social media at an unprecedented rate, easing the analysis of individual and public sentiments. Sentiment analysis has shown to be useful in probing and understanding emotions, expressions and attitudes in the text. However, the distinct characteristics of social media data present challenges to traditional sentiment analysis. First, social media data is often noisy, incomplete and fast-evolved which necessitates the design of a sophisticated learning model. Second, sentiment labels are hard to collect which further exacerbates the problem by not being able to discriminate sentiment polarities. Meanwhile, opportunities are also unequivocally presented. Social media contains rich sources of sentiment signals in textual terms and user interactions, which could be helpful in sentiment analysis. While there are some attempts to leverage implicit sentiment signals in positive user interactions, little attention is paid on signed social networks with both positive and negative links. The availability of signed social networks motivates us to investigate if negative links also contain useful sentiment signals. In this paper, we study a novel problem of unsupervised sentiment analysis with signed social networks. In particular, we incorporate explicit sentiment signals in textual terms and implicit sentiment signals from signed social networks into a coherent model SignedSenti for unsupervised sentiment analysis. Empirical experiments on two real-world datasets corroborate its effectiveness",

    "abstract": "Named entity recognition (NER), which focuses on the extraction of semantically meaningful named entities and their semantic classes from text, serves as an indispensable component for several down-stream natural language processing (NLP) tasks such as relation extraction and event extraction. Dependency trees, on the other hand, also convey crucial semantic-level information. It has been shown previously that such information can be used to improve the performance of NER. In this work, we investigate on how to better utilize the structured information conveyed by dependency trees to improve the performance of NER. Specifically, unlike existing approaches which only exploit dependency information for designing local features, we show that certain global structured information of the dependency trees can be exploited when building NER models where such information can provide guided learning and inference. Through extensive experiments, we show that our proposed novel dependency-guided NER model performs competitively with models based on conventional semi-Markov conditional random fields, while requiring significantly less running time",

The existing approaches based on NLP, frequency, and statistics cannot extract high quality phrases and the processing is also time consuming, which are not suitable for dynamic on-line applications. In this paper, we propose an efficient high-quality phrase mining approach (EQPM). To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first effort that considers both intra-cohesion and inter-isolation in mining phrases, which is able to guarantee appropriateness. We also propose a strategy to eliminate order sensitiveness, and ensure the completeness of phrases. We further design efficient algorithms to make the proposed model and strategy feasible.

Our supervised classifier makes use of an automatic discourse parser which outputs Penn Discourse Treebank (PDTB) tags that represent in-post discourse features. We show PDTB relation-based features increase the robustness of the classifier and complement baseline features in recalling more diverse instructor intervention patterns.

However, such sentiment scopes are typically not explicitly annotated in the data, and their lengths can be unbounded. Motivated by this, unlike traditional approaches that cast this problem as a simple sequence labeling task, we propose a novel approach that can explicitly model the latent sentiment scopes.

    "abstract": "Time-inconsistency refers to a paradox in decision making where agents exhibit inconsistent behaviors over time. Examples are procrastination where agents tend to postpone easy tasks, and abandonments where agents start a plan and quit in the middle. To capture such behaviors and to quantify inefficiency caused by such behaviors, Kleinberg and Oren (2014) propose a graph model with a certain cost structure and initiate the study of several interesting computation problems: 1) cost ratio: the worst ratio between the actual cost of the agent and the optimal cost, over all the graph instances; 2) motivating subgraph: how to motivate the agent to reach the goal by deleting nodes and edges; 3) Intermediate rewards: how to incentivize agents to reach the goal by placing intermediate rewards. Kleinberg and Oren give partial answers to these questions, but the main problems are open. In this paper, we give answers to all three open problems. First, we show a tight upper bound of cost ratio for graphs, and confirm the conjecture by Kleinberg and Oren that Akerlof's structure is indeed the worst case for cost ratio. Second, we prove that finding a motivating subgraph is NP-hard, showing that it is generally inefficient to motivate agents by deleting nodes and edges in the graph. Last but not least, we show that computing a strategy to place minimum amount of total reward is also NP-hard and we provide a 2n- approximation algorithm",

An optimal cost partitioning is often prohibitively expensive to compute. Saturated cost partitioning is an alternative that is much faster to compute and has been shown to offer high-quality heuristic guidance on Cartesian abstractions. However, its greedy nature makes it highly susceptible to the order in which the heuristics are considered. We show that searching in the space of orders leads to significantly better heuristic estimates than with previously considered orders. Moreover, using multiple orders leads to a heuristic that is significantly better informed than any single-order heuristic.

We consider various parameters, including both the original and desired size of the plan order, as well as its width and height.

Problem PPL is fpt if parameterized with the size of the non-concurrency relation, but para-NP-hard in most other cases. We also consider this problem when the number (k) of agents, or processors, is restricted, finding that this number is a crucial parameter; this problem is fixed-parameter tractable with the order size, the parallel execution length and k as parameter, but para-NP-hard without k as parameter",

Width-based methodsseek novel states, are not goal oriented, and their power has been shown recently in the Atari and GVG-AI video-games.

    "abstract": "Plan recognition aims to recognize target plans given observed actions with history plan libraries ordomain models in hand. Despite of the success of previous plan recognition approaches, they all neglect the impact of human preferences on plans. For example, a kid in a shopping mall might prefer to \"executing'' a plan of playing in water park, while an adult might prefer to \"executing'' a plan of having a cup of coffee. It could be helpful for improving the plan recognition accuracy to consider human preferences on plans. We assume there are historical rating scores on a subset of plans given by humans, and action sequences observed on humans. We estimate unknown rating scores based on rating scores in hand using an off-the-shelf collaborative filtering approach. We then discover plans to best explain the estimated rating scores and observed actions using a skip-gram based approach. In the experiment, we evaluate our approach in three planning domains to demonstrate its effectiveness",

    "abstract": "State estimation is the task of estimating the state of a partially observable dynamical system given a sequence of executed actions and observations. In logical settings, state estimation can be realized via logical filtering, which is exact but can be intractable. We propose logical smoothing, a form of backwards reasoning that works in concert with approximated logical filtering to refine past beliefs in light of new observations. We characterize the notion of logical smoothing together with an algorithm for backwards-forwards state estimation. We also present an approximation of our smoothing algorithm that is space efficient. We prove properties of our algorithms, and experimentally demonstrate their behaviour, contrasting them with state estimation methods for planning. Smoothing and backwards-forwards reasoning are important techniques for reasoning about partially observable dynamical systems, introducing the logical analogue of effective techniques from control theory and dynamic programming",

However, computing optimal solutions for POMDPs is challenging because of the high computational requirements of POMDP solution algorithms. Several algorithms use a subroutine to prune dominated vectors in value functions, which requires a large number of linear programs (LPs) to be solved and it represents a large part of the total running time. In this paper we show how the LPs in POMDP pruning subroutines can be decomposed using a Benders decomposition. The resulting algorithm incrementally adds LP constraints and uses only a small fraction of the constraints. Our algorithm significantly improves the performance of existing pruning methods and the commonly used incremental pruning algorithm. Our new variant of incremental pruning is the fastest optimal pruning-based POMDP algorithm",

    "title": "When to Reset Your Keys: Optimal Timing of Security Updates via Learning",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Cybersecurity is increasingly threatened by advanced and persistent attacks. As these attacks are often designed to disable a system (or a critical resource, e.g., a user account) repeatedly, it is crucial for the defender to keep updating its security measures to strike a balance between the risk of being compromised and the cost of security updates. Moreover, these decisions often need to be made with limited and delayed feedback due to the stealthy nature of advanced attacks. In addition to targeted attacks, such an optimal timing policy under incomplete information has broad applications in cybersecurity. Examples include key rotation, password change, application of patches, and virtual machine refreshing. However, rigorous studies of optimal timing are rare. Further, existing solutions typically rely on a pre-defined attack model that is known to the defender, which is often not the case in practice. In this work, we make an initial effort towards achieving optimal timing of security updates in the face of unknown stealthy attacks. We consider a variant of the influential FlipIt game model with asymmetric feedback and unknown attack time distribution, which provides a general model to consecutive security updates.The defender's problem is then modeled as a time associative bandit problem with dependent arms. We derive upper confidence bound based learning policies that achieve low regret compared with optimal periodic defense strategies that can only be derived when attack time distributions are known",

    "abstract": "Heuristics serve as a powerful tool in modern domain-independent planning (DIP) systems by providing critical guidance during the search for high-quality solutions. However, they have not been broadly used with hierarchical planning techniques, which are more expressive and tend to scale better in complex domains by exploiting additional domain-specific knowledge. Complicating matters, we show that for Hierarchical Goal Network (HGN) planning, a goal-based hierarchical planning formalism that we focus on in this paper, any poly-time heuristic that is derived from a delete-relaxation DIP heuristic has to make some relaxation of the hierarchical semantics. To address this, we present a principled framework for incorporating DIP heuristics into HGN planning using a simple relaxation of the HGN semantics we call Hierarchy-Relaxation. This framework allows for computing heuristic estimates of HGN problems using any DIP heuristic in an admissibility-preserving manner. We demonstrate the feasibility of this approach by using the LMCut heuristic to guide an optimal HGN planner. Our empirical results with three benchmark domains demonstrate that simultaneously leveraging hierarchical knowledge and heuristic guidance substantially improves planning performance",

Second, we discuss 2 classes of decentralized robust plan-execution policies (called Fully Synchronized Policies and Minimal Communication Policies) that prevent collisions during plan execution for valid MAPF-DP plans.

The resulting problems can then be solved quickly, and the process is repeated during execution when states outside the restricted region are encountered. Typically, these approaches focus on states that are within some distance measure of the start state (e.g., number of actions or probability of being reached). However, these short-sighted approaches make it difficult to propagate information from states that are closer to a goal than to the start state, thus missing opportunities to improve planning. We present an alternative approach in which short-sightedness is used only to determine whether a state should be labeled as solved or not, but otherwise the set of states that can be accounted for during planning is unrestricted. Based on this idea, we propose the FLARES algorithm and show that it performs consistently well on a wide range of benchmark problems",

This method is applied to two existing approaches for computing policies satisfying constraints: the Constrained MDP framework and a Column Generation approach. We also introduce an algorithm to adaptively relax the bound up to a given maximum violation tolerance. Experiments on a hard toy problem show that the resulting policies outperform static optimal resource allocations to an arbitrary level. By testing the algorithms on more realistic planning domains from the literature, we demonstrate that the adaptive bound is able to efficiently trade off violation probability with expected value, outperforming state-of-the-art planners",

Furthermore, CoCoA uses a unique-first approach to improve the solution quality. It is designed such that it can solve DCOPs as well as Asymmetric DCOPS, with only few messages being communicated between neighboring agents. Experimentally, through evaluating graph coloring problems, randomized (A)DCOPs, and a sensor network communication problem, we show that CoCoA is able to very quickly find solutions of high quality with a smaller communication overhead than state-of-the-art DCOP solvers such as DSA, MGM-2, ACLS, MCS-MGM and Max-Sum.

Specifically, m-wBTP allows to merge more values than BTP. k-BTP, WBTP and m-BTP permit to capture more tractable instances than BTP. Here, we introduce a new weaker form of BTP, which will be called m-fBTP for flexible broken-triangle property. m-fBTP allows on the one hand to eliminate more variables than BTP while preserving satisfiability and on the other to define new bigger tractable class for which arc consistency is a decision procedure.

We show that the size of an S5-model satisfying a formula phi can be bounded by its diamond degree. Such measure can thus be used as an upper bound for generating a SAT encoding for the S5-satisfiability of that formula. We also propose a lightweight caching system which allows us to further reduce the size of the propositional formula.We implemented a generic SAT-based approach within the modal logic S5 solver S52SAT. It allowed us to compare experimentally our new upper-bound against previously known one, i.e. the number of modalities of phi and to evaluate the effect of our caching technique.

    "abstract": "Recently, a number of non-uniform random satisfiability models have been proposed that are closer to practical satisfiability problems in some characteristics. In contrast to uniform random Boolean formulas, scale-free formulas have a variable occurrence distribution that follows a power law. It has been conjectured that such a distribution is a more accurate model for some industrial instances than the uniform random model. Though it seems that there is already an awareness of a threshold phenomenon in such models, there is still a complete picture lacking. In contrast to the uniform model, the critical density threshold does not lie at a single point, but instead exhibits a functional dependency on the power-law exponent. For scale-free formulas with clauses of length k=2, we give a lower bound on the phase transition threshold as a function of the scaling parameter. We also perform computational studies that suggest our bound is tight and investigate the critical density for formulas with higher clause lengths. Similar to the uniform model, on formulas with k>=3, we find that the phase transition regime corresponds to a set of formulas that are difficult to solve by backtracking search",

In light of these results, we propose a novel probabilistic approach for random Max-SAT called ProMS.

    "title": "General Bounds on Satisfiability Thresholds for Random CSPs via Fourier Analysis",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Random constraint satisfaction problems (CSPs) have been widely studied both in AI and complexity theory. Empirically and theoretically, many random CSPs have been shown to exhibit a phase transition. As the ratio of constraints to variables passes certain thresholds, they transition from being almost certainly satisfiable to unsatisfiable. The exact location of this threshold has been thoroughly investigated, but only for certain common classes of constraints. In this paper, we present new bounds for the location of these thresholds in boolean CSPs. Our main contribution is that our bounds are fully general, and apply to any fixed constraint function that could be used to generate an ensemble of random CSPs. These bounds rely on a novel Fourier analysis and can be easily computed from the Fourier spectrum of a constraint function. Our bounds are within a constant factor of the exact threshold location for many well-studied random CSPs. We demonstrate that our bounds can be easily instantiated to obtain thresholds for many constraint functions that had not been previously studied, and evaluate them experimentally",

    "abstract": "When a small pattern graph does not occur inside a larger target graph, we can ask how to find \"as much of the pattern as possible\" inside the target graph. In general, this is known as the maximum common subgraph problem, which is much more computationally challenging in practice than subgraph isomorphism. We introduce a restricted alternative, where we ask if all but k vertices from the pattern can be found in the target graph. This allows for the development of slightly weakened forms of certain invariants from subgraph isomorphism which are based upon degree and number of paths. We show that when k is small, weakening the invariants still retains much of their effectiveness. We are then able to solve this problem on the standard problem instances used to benchmark subgraph isomorphism algorithms, despite these instances being too large for current maximum common subgraph algorithms to handle. Finally, by iteratively increasing k, we obtain an algorithm which is also competitive for the maximum common subgraph",

We demonstrate that Max#SAT has applications in many areas, showing how it can be used to solve problems in probabilistic inference (marginal MAP), planning, program synthesis, and quantitative information flow analysis. We also give an algorithm which by making only polynomially many calls to an NP oracle can approximate the maximum count to within any desired multiplicative error. The NP queries needed are relatively simple, arising from recent practical approximate model counting and sampling algorithms, which allows our technique to be effectively implemented with a SAT solver.

    "abstract": "The number of images is growing rapidly in recent years because of development of Internet, especially the social networks like Facebook, and the popularization of portable image capture devices like smart phone. Annotating them with semantically meaningful words to describe them, i.e., classification, is a useful way to manage these images. However, the huge number of images and classes brings several challenges to classification, of which two are 1) how to measure the similarity efficiently between large-scale images, for example, measuring similarity between samples is the building block for SVM and kNN classifiers, and 2) how to train supervised classification models for newly emerging classes with only a few or even no labeled samples because new concepts appear every day in the Web, like Tesla's Model S. The research of my Ph. D. thesis focuses on the two problems in large-scale image classification mentioned above. Formally, these two problems are termed as large-scale similarity search which focuses on the large scale of samples/images and zero-shot/few-shots learning which focuses on the large scale of classes. Specifically, my research considers the following three aspects: 1) hashing based large-scale similarity search which adopts hashing to improve the efficiency; 2) cross-class transfer active learning which simultaneously transfers knowledge from the abundant labeled samples in the Web and selects the most informative samples for expert labeling such that we can construct effective classifiers for novel classes with only a few labeled samples; and 3) zero-shot learning which utilizes no labeled samples for novel classes at all to build supervised classifiers for them by transferring knowledge from the related classes",

    "abstract": "Cyber-physical systems (CPS) are intended to receive information from the environment through sensors and perform appropriate actions using actuators of the controller. In the last years world of intelligent technologies has grown in an exponential fashion: from cruise control to smart ecosystems. Next we are facing the future of CPS involved in almost every aspect of our lives bringing higher comfortability and efficiency. Our goal is to help smart inventions adjust to this highly uncertain environment and guarantee safety for its inhabitants. The physical environment renders the problem of CPS verification extremely cumbersome. Due to a wealth of uncertainties introduced by physical processes, the system is best described by stochastic models. Approximate prediction techniques, such as Statistical Model Checking (SMC), have therefore recently become increasingly popular. As a result, verification of a CPS boils down to quantitative analysis of how close the system is to reaching bad states (safety property) or desired goal (liveness property). Controlling the systems, that is, computing appropriate response actions depending on the environment, involves probabilistic state estimation, as well as optimal action prediction, i.e., choosing the best next step by simulating the future. In my thesis, I develop a novel intelligent algorithm addressing existing deficiencies of SMC such as poor prediction of rare events (RE) and sampling divergence",

An active area of Interactive Narrative (IN) research uses automated planning to generate story plans as it can lighten the authorial burden of writing a branching story. Branches can be generated from a declarative representation rather than hand-crafted. A goal of an Experience Manager (EM) is to guide a user through a space of desirable narrative trajectories, or story branches, in an IN. However, in the cases when an EM must accommodate user actions and mediate them from a desired narrative trajectory to a new narrative trajectory, automated planning's authorial advantage becomes a liability as the available narrative trajectories are not known apriori. This limitation can lead to the EM choosing a new narrative trajectory that is not coherent with the previous one and may result in a negative user experience. The goal of my research is to develop a problem formulation methodology for story planning problems that elicits the available narrative trajectories enabling an EM to execute more coherent accommodations",

Despite the success, social mobilization is not without its limitations. Local trapping of diffusion and the dependence on highly connected individuals to mobilize people in distance locations affect the effectiveness of social mobilization. Furthermore, as empirical studies on people's responses to various social mobilization approaches are lacking, it is a significant challenge for artificial intelligence (AI) researchers to design effective and efficient decision support mechanisms to help manage this emerging phenomenon. In my thesis, I conduct large-scale empirical studies to help the AI research community establish baseline personal variabilities in different people's response patterns to social mobilization approaches. Based on the collected dataset, I will further propose computational algorithmic crowdsourcing mechanisms which leverage the empirical evidence to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of social mobilization, towards achieving superlinear productivity.

For example, online advertising click logs can be represented by a three-mode tensor (user, advertisement, context). The analysis of tensors is closely related to many important applications, such as click-through-rate (CTR) prediction, anomaly detection and product recommendation. Despite the success of existing tensor analysis approaches, such as Tucker, CANDECOMP/PARAFAC and infinite Tucker decompositions, they are either not enough powerful to capture complex hidden relationships in data, or not scalable to handle real-world large data. In addition, they may suffer from the extreme sparsity in real data, i.e., when the portion of nonzero entries is extremely low; they lack of principled ways to discover other patterns — such as an unknown number of latent clusters — which are critical for data mining tasks such as anomaly detection and market targeting. To address these challenges, I used nonparametric Bayesian techniques, such as Gaussian processes (GP) and Dirichlet processes (DP), to model highly nonlinear interactions and to extract hidden patterns in tensors; I derived tractable variational evidence lower bounds, based on which I developed scalable, distributed or online approximate inference algorithms.

Structured prediction focuses on prediction task where the outputs are structured and interdependent, contrary to the non-structured prediction which assumes that the outputs are independent of other predicted outputs. Structured prediction is an important problem as there are structures inherently existing in time series data. One difficulty for structured prediction is that the number of possible outputs can be exponential which makes modeling all the potential outputs intractable",

As the EEG electrode sensors measure electrical potentials on the scalp instead of direct measuring activities of brain voxels deep inside the head, many approaches are proposed to infer the activated brain regions due to its significance in neuroscience research and clinical application. However, since mostly part of the brain activity is composed of the spontaneous neural activities or non-task related activations, task related activation patterns will be corrupted in strong background signal/noises. In our research, we proposed a sparse learning framework for solving EEG inverse problem which aims to explicitly extract the discriminative sources for different cognitive tasks by fusing the label information into the inverse model. The proposed framework is capable of estimation the discriminative brain sources under given different brain states where traditional inverse methods failed. We introduced two models, one is formulated as supervised sparse dictionary learning and the other one is the graph regularized discriminative source estimation model to promote the consistency within same class. Preliminary experimental results also validated that the proposed sparse learning framework is effective to discover the discriminative task-related brain activation sources, which shows the potential to advance the high resolution EEG source analysis for real-time non-invasive brain imaging research",
