    "title": "Representation Balancing Offline Model-based Reinforcement Learning",
    "abstract": "One of the main challenges in offline and off-policy reinforcement learning is to cope with the distribution shift that arises from the mismatch between the target policy and the data collection policy. In this paper, we focus on a model-based approach, particularly on learning the representation for a robust model of the environment under the distribution shift, which has been first studied by Representation Balancing MDP (RepBM). Although this prior work has shown promising results, there are a number of shortcomings that still hinder its applicability to practical tasks. In particular, we address the curse of horizon exhibited by RepBM, rejecting most of the pre-collected data in long-term tasks. We present a new objective for model learning motivated by recent advances in the estimation of stationary distribution corrections. This effectively overcomes the aforementioned limitation of RepBM, as well as naturally extending to continuous action spaces and stochastic policies. We also present an offline model-based policy optimization using this new objective, yielding the state-of-the-art performance in a representative set of benchmark offline RL tasks",

    "title": "RODE: Learning Roles to Decompose Multi-Agent Tasks",
    "abstract": "Role-based learning holds the promise of achieving scalable multi-agent learning by decomposing complex tasks using roles. However, it is largely unclear how to efficiently discover such a set of roles. To solve this problem, we propose to first decompose joint action spaces into restricted role action spaces by clustering actions according to their effects on the environment and other agents. Learning a role selector based on action effects makes role discovery much easier because it forms a bi-level learning hierarchy -- the role selector searches in a smaller role space and at a lower temporal resolution, while role policies learn in significantly reduced primitive action-observation spaces. We further integrate information about action effects into the role policies to boost learning efficiency and policy generalization. By virtue of these advances, our method (1) outperforms the current state-of-the-art MARL algorithms on 10 of the 14 scenarios that comprise the challenging StarCraft II micromanagement benchmark and (2) achieves rapid transfer to new environments with three times the number of agents.

    "title": "Learning Manifold Patch-Based Representations of Man-Made Shapes",
    "abstract": "Choosing the right shape representation for geometry is crucial for making 3D models compatible with existing applications. Focusing on piecewise-smooth man-made shapes, we propose a new representation that is usable in conventional CAD modeling pipelines and can also be learned by deep neural networks. We demonstrate the benefits of our representation by applying it to the task of sketch-based modeling. Given a raster image, our system infers a set of parametric surfaces that realize the input in 3D. To capture the piecewise smooth geometry of man-made shapes, we learn a special shape representation: a deformable parametric template composed of Coons patches. Naively training such a system, however, would suffer from non-manifold artifacts of the parametric shapes as well as from a lack of data. To address this, we introduce loss functions that bias the network to output non-self-intersecting shapes and implement them as part of a fully self-supervised system, automatically generating both shape templates and synthetic training data. To test the efficacy of our system, we develop a testbed for sketch-based modeling and show results on a gallery of synthetic and real artist sketches. As additional applications, we also demonstrate shape interpolation and provide comparison to related work",

    "abstract": "Graph-structured data are ubiquitous. However, graphs encode diverse types of information and thus play different roles in data representation. In this paper, we distinguish the \\textit{representational} and the \\textit{correlational} roles played by the graphs in node-level prediction tasks, and we investigate how Graph Neural Network (GNN) models can effectively leverage both types of information. Conceptually, the representational information provides guidance for the model to construct better node features; while the correlational information indicates the correlation between node outcomes conditional on node features. Through a simulation study, we find that many popular GNN models are incapable of effectively utilizing the correlational information. By leveraging the idea of the copula, a principled way to describe the dependence among multivariate random variables, we offer a general solution. The proposed Copula Graph Neural Network (CopulaGNN) can take a wide range of GNN models as base models and utilize both representational and correlational information stored in the graphs.

    "title": "Deep Partition Aggregation: Provable Defenses against General Poisoning Attacks",
    "abstract": "Adversarial poisoning attacks distort training data in order to corrupt the test-time behavior of a classifier. A provable defense provides a certificate for each test sample, which is a lower bound on the magnitude of any adversarial distortion of the training set that can corrupt the test sample's classification. We propose two provable defenses against poisoning attacks: (i) Deep Partition Aggregation (DPA), a certified defense against a general poisoning threat model, defined as the insertion or deletion of a bounded number of samples to the training set -- by implication, this threat model also includes arbitrary distortions to a bounded number of images and/or labels; and (ii) Semi-Supervised DPA (SS-DPA), a certified defense against label-flipping poisoning attacks. DPA is an ensemble method where base models are trained on partitions of the training set determined by a hash function. DPA is related to subset aggregation, a well-studied ensemble method in classical machine learning. DPA can also be viewed as an extension of randomized ablation (Levine & Feizi, 2020a), a certified defense against sparse evasion attacks, to the poisoning domain. Our label-flipping defense, SS-DPA, uses a semi-supervised learning algorithm as its base classifier model: we train each base classifier using the entire unlabeled training set in addition to the labels for a partition. SS-DPA outperforms the existing certified defense for label-flipping attacks (Rosenfeld et al., 2020). SS-DPA certifies >= 50% of test images against 675 label flips (vs. = 50% of test images against > 500 poison image insertions on MNIST, and nine insertions on CIFAR-10.

    "title": "Generalization bounds via distillation",
    "abstract": "This paper theoretically investigates the following empirical phenomenon: given a high-complexity network with poor generalization bounds, one can distill it into a network with nearly identical predictions but low complexity and vastly smaller generalization bounds. The main contribution is an analysis showing that the original network inherits this good generalization bound from its distillation, assuming the use of well-behaved data augmentation. This bound is presented both in an abstract and in a concrete form, the latter complemented by a reduction technique to handle modern computation graphs featuring convolutional layers, fullyconnected layers, and skip connections, to name a few. To round out the story, a (looser) classical uniform convergence analysis of compression is also presented, as well as a variety of experiments on cifar10 and mnist demonstrating similar generalization performance between the original network and its distillation. 1 OVERVIEW AND MAIN RESULTS Generalization bounds are statistical tools which take as input various measurements of a predictor on training data, and output a performance estimate for unseen data — that is, they estimate how well the predictor generalizes to unseen data. Despite extensive development spanning many decades (Anthony & Bartlett, 1999), there is growing concern that these bounds are not only disastrously loose (Dziugaite & Roy, 2017), but worse that they do not correlate with the underlying phenomena (Jiang et al., 2019b), and even that the basic method of proof is doomed (Zhang et al., 2016; Nagarajan & Kolter, 2019). As an explicit demonstration of the looseness of these bounds, Figure 1 calculates bounds for a standard ResNet architecture achieving test errors of respectively 0.008 and 0.067 on mnist and cifar10; the observed generalization gap is 10−1, while standard generalization techniques upper bound it with 10. Contrary to this dilemma, there is evidence that these networks can often be compressed or distilled into simpler networks, while still preserving their output values and low test error. Meanwhile, these simpler networks exhibit vastly better generalization bounds: again referring to Figure 1, those same networks from before can be distilled with hardly any change to their outputs, while their bounds reduce by a factor of roughly 10. Distillation is widely studied (Buciluŭ et al., 2006; Hinton et al., 2015), but usually the original network is discarded and only the final distilled network is preserved. The purpose of this work is to carry the good generalization bounds of the distilled network back to the original network; in a sense, the explicit simplicity of the distilled network is used as a witness to implicit simplicity of the original network. The main contributions are as follows. • The main theoretical contribution is a generalization bound for the original, undistilled network which scales primarily with the generalization properties of its distillation, assuming that wellbehaved data augmentation is used to measure the distillation distance. An abstract version of this bound is stated in Lemma 1.1, along with a sufficient data augmentation technique in Lemma 1.2. A concrete version of the bound, suitable to handle the ResNet architecture in Figure 1, is described in Theorem 1.3. Handling sophisticated architectures with only minor proof alterations is another contribution of this work, and is described alongside Theorem 1.3. This abstract and concrete analysis is sketched in Section 3, with full proofs deferred to appendices. • Rather than using an assumption on the distillation process (e.g., the aforementioned \"wellbehaved data augmentation\"), this work also gives a direct uniform convergence analysis, culminating in Theorem 1.4. This is presented partially as an open problem or cautionary tale, as",

    "title": "Learning perturbation sets for robust machine learning",
    "abstract": "Although much progress has been made towards robust deep learning, a significant gap in robustness remains between real-world perturbations and more narrowly defined sets typically studied in adversarial defenses. In this paper, we aim to bridge this gap by learning perturbation sets from data, in order to characterize real-world effects for robust training and evaluation. Specifically, we use a conditional generator that defines the perturbation set over a constrained region of the latent space. We formulate desirable properties that measure the quality of a learned perturbation set, and theoretically prove that a conditional variational autoencoder naturally satisfies these criteria. Using this framework, our approach can generate a variety of perturbations at different complexities and scales, ranging from baseline spatial transformations, through common image corruptions, to lighting variations. We measure the quality of our learned perturbation sets both quantitatively and qualitatively, finding that our models are capable of producing a diverse set of meaningful perturbations beyond the limited data seen during training. Finally, we leverage our learned perturbation sets to train models which are empirically and certifiably robust to adversarial image corruptions and adversarial lighting variations, while improving generalization on non-adversarial data.

    "title": "Efficient Empowerment Estimation for Unsupervised Stabilization",
    "abstract": "Intrinsically motivated artiﬁcial agents learn advantageous behavior without externally-provided rewards. Previously, it was shown that maximizing mutual information between agent actuators and future states, known as the empowerment principle, enables unsupervised stabilization of dynamical systems at upright positions, which is a prototypical intrinsically motivated behavior for upright standing and walking. This follows from the coincidence between the objective of stabilization and the objective of empowerment. Unfortunately, sample-based estimation of this kind of mutual information is challenging. Recently, various variational lower bounds (VLBs) on empowerment have been proposed as solutions; however, they are often biased, unstable in training, and have high sample complexity. In this work, we propose an alternative solution based on a trainable representation of a dynamical system as a Gaussian channel, which allows us to efﬁciently calculate an unbiased estimator of empowerment by convex optimization. We demonstrate our solution for sample-based unsupervised stabilization on different dynamical control systems and show the advantages of our method by comparing it to the existing VLB approaches. Speciﬁcally, we show that our method has a lower sample complexity, is more stable in training, possesses the essential properties of the empowerment function, and allows estimation of empowerment from images. Consequently, our method opens a path to wider and easier adoption of empowerment for various applications. 1",

    "abstract": "Encoder layer fusion (EncoderFusion) is a technique to fuse all the encoder layers (instead of the uppermost layer) for sequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq) models, which has proven effective on various NLP tasks. However, it is still not entirely clear why and when EncoderFusion should work. In this paper, our main contribution is to take a step further in understanding EncoderFusion. Many of previous studies believe that the success of EncoderFusion comes from exploiting surface and syntactic information embedded in lower encoder layers. Unlike them, we find that the encoder embedding layer is more important than other intermediate encoder layers. In addition, the uppermost decoder layer consistently pays more attention to the encoder embedding layer across NLP tasks. Based on this observation, we propose a simple fusion method, SurfaceFusion, by fusing only the encoder embedding layer for the softmax layer. Experimental results show that SurfaceFusion outperforms EncoderFusion on several NLP benchmarks, including machine translation, text summarization, and grammatical error correction. It obtains the state-of-the-art performance on WMT16 Romanian-English and WMT14 English-French translation tasks. Extensive analyses reveal that SurfaceFusion learns more expressive bilingual word embeddings by building a closer relationship between relevant source and target embeddings.

GNN variants differ in how each node in the graph absorbs the information flowing from its neighbor nodes. In this paper, we highlight an inherent problem in GNNs: the mechanism of propagating information between neighbors creates a bottleneck when every node aggregates messages from its neighbors. This bottleneck causes the over-squashing of exponentially-growing information into fixed-size vectors. As a result, the graph fails to propagate messages flowing from distant nodes and performs poorly when the prediction task depends on long-range information. We demonstrate that the bottleneck hinders popular GNNs from fitting the training data. We show that GNNs that absorb incoming edges equally, like GCN and GIN, are more susceptible to over-squashing than other GNN types. We further show that existing, extensively-tuned, GNN-based models suffer from over-squashing and that breaking the bottleneck improves state-of-the-art results without any hyperparameter tuning or additional weights",

    "title": "Proximal Gradient Descent-Ascent: Variable Convergence under KŁ Geometry",
    "abstract": "The gradient descent-ascent (GDA) algorithm has been widely applied to solve minimax optimization problems. In order to achieve convergent policy parameters for minimax optimization, it is important that GDA generates convergent variable sequences rather than convergent sequences of function values or gradient norms. However, the variable convergence of GDA has been proved only under convexity geometries, and there lacks understanding for general nonconvex minimax optimization. This paper fills such a gap by studying the convergence of a more general proximal-GDA for regularized nonconvex-strongly-concave minimax optimization. Specifically, we show that proximal-GDA admits a novel Lyapunov function, which monotonically decreases in the minimax optimization process and drives the variable sequence to a critical point. By leveraging this Lyapunov function and the KŁ geometry that parameterizes the local geometries of general nonconvex functions, we formally establish the variable convergence of proximal-GDA to a critical point x, i.e., xt → x, yt → y(x). Furthermore, over the full spectrum of the KŁ-parameterized geometry, we show that proximalGDA achieves different types of convergence rates ranging from sublinear convergence up to finite-step convergence, depending on the geometry associated with the KŁ parameter. This is the first theoretical result on the variable convergence for nonconvex minimax optimization",

    "title": "Regularization Matters in Policy Optimization - An Empirical Study on Continuous Control",
    "abstract": "Deep Reinforcement Learning (Deep RL) has been receiving increasingly more attention thanks to its encouraging performance on a variety of control tasks. Yet, conventional regularization techniques in training neural networks (e.g., $L_2$ regularization, dropout) have been largely ignored in RL methods, possibly because agents are typically trained and evaluated in the same environment, and because the deep RL community focuses more on high-level algorithm designs. In this work, we present the first comprehensive study of regularization techniques with multiple policy optimization algorithms on continuous control tasks. Interestingly, we find conventional regularization techniques on the policy networks can often bring large improvement, especially on harder tasks. We also compare these techniques with the more widely used entropy regularization. Our findings are shown to be robust against training hyperparameter variations. In addition, we study regularizing different components and find that only regularizing the policy network is typically the best. Finally, we discuss and analyze why regularization may help generalization in RL from four perspectives: sample complexity, reward distribution, weight norm, and noise robustness. We hope our study provides guidance for future practices in regularizing policy optimization algorithms. Our code is available at https://github.com/xuanlinli17/po-rl-regularization",

    "abstract": "Graph neural networks (GNNs) are powerful models that have been successful in various graph representation learning tasks. Whereas gradient boosted decision trees (GBDT) often outperform other machine learning methods when faced with heterogeneous tabular data. But what approach should be used for graphs with tabular node features? Previous GNN models have mostly focused on networks with homogeneous sparse features and, as we show, are suboptimal in the heterogeneous setting. In this work, we propose a novel architecture that trains GBDT and GNN jointly to get the best of both worlds: the GBDT model deals with heterogeneous features, while GNN accounts for the graph structure. Our model benefits from end-to-end optimization by allowing new trees to fit the gradient updates of GNN. With an extensive experimental comparison to the leading GBDT and GNN models, we demonstrate a significant increase in performance on a variety of graphs with tabular features.

    "title": "Tilted Empirical Risk Minimization",
    "abstract": "Empirical risk minimization (ERM) is typically designed to perform well on the average loss, which can result in estimators that are sensitive to outliers, generalize poorly, or treat subgroups unfairly. While many methods aim to address these problems individually, in this work, we explore them through a unified framework---tilted empirical risk minimization (TERM). In particular, we show that it is possible to flexibly tune the impact of individual losses through a straightforward extension to ERM using a hyperparameter called the tilt. We provide several interpretations of the resulting framework: We show that TERM can increase or decrease the influence of outliers, respectively, to enable fairness or robustness; has variance-reduction properties that can benefit generalization; and can be viewed as a smooth approximation to a superquantile method. We develop batch and stochastic first-order optimization methods for solving TERM, and show that the problem can be efficiently solved relative to common alternatives. Finally, we demonstrate that TERM can be used for a multitude of applications, such as enforcing fairness between subgroups, mitigating the effect of outliers, and handling class imbalance. TERM is not only competitive with existing solutions tailored to these individual problems, but can also enable entirely new applications, such as simultaneously addressing outliers and promoting fairness",

    "title": "CO2: Consistent Contrast for Unsupervised Visual Representation Learning",
    "abstract": "Contrastive learning has been adopted as a core method for unsupervised visual representation learning. Without human annotation, the common practice is to perform an instance discrimination task: Given a query image crop, this task labels crops from the same image as positives, and crops from other randomly sampled images as negatives. An important limitation of this label assignment strategy is that it can not reflect the heterogeneous similarity between the query crop and each crop from other images, taking them as equally negative, while some of them may even belong to the same semantic class as the query. To address this issue, inspired by consistency regularization in semi-supervised learning on unlabeled data, we propose Consistent Contrast (CO2), which introduces a consistency regularization term into the current contrastive learning framework. Regarding the similarity of the query crop to each crop from other images as \"unlabeled\", the consistency term takes the corresponding similarity of a positive crop as a pseudo label, and encourages consistency between these two similarities. Empirically, CO2 improves Momentum Contrast (MoCo) by 2.9% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet linear protocol, 3.8% and 1.1% top-5 accuracy on 1% and 10% labeled semi-supervised settings. It also transfers to image classification, object detection, and semantic segmentation on PASCAL VOC. This shows that CO2 learns better visual representations for these downstream tasks",

    "title": "Why Are Convolutional Nets More Sample-Efficient than Fully-Connected Nets?",
    "abstract": "Convolutional neural networks often dominate fully-connected counterparts in generalization performance, especially on image classification tasks. This is often explained in terms of 'better inductive bias'. However, this has not been made mathematically rigorous, and the hurdle is that the fully connected net can always simulate the convolutional net (for a fixed task). Thus the training algorithm plays a role. The current work describes a natural task on which a provable sample complexity gap can be shown, for standard training algorithms. We construct a single natural distribution on $\\mathbb{R}^d\\times\\{\\pm 1\\}$ on which any orthogonal-invariant algorithm (i.e. fully-connected networks trained with most gradient-based methods from gaussian initialization) requires $\\Omega(d^2)$ samples to generalize while $O(1)$ samples suffice for convolutional architectures. Furthermore, we demonstrate a single target function, learning which on all possible distributions leads to an $O(1)$ vs $\\Omega(d^2/\\varepsilon)$ gap. The proof relies on the fact that SGD on fully-connected network is orthogonal equivariant. Similar results are achieved for $\\ell_2$ regression and adaptive training algorithms, e.g. Adam and AdaGrad, which are only permutation equivariant",

    "title": "FastSpeech 2: Fast and High-Quality End-to-End Text to Speech",
    "abstract": "Advanced text to speech (TTS) models such as FastSpeech can synthesize speech significantly faster than previous autoregressive models with comparable quality. The training of FastSpeech model relies on an autoregressive teacher model for duration prediction (to provide more information as input) and knowledge distillation (to simplify the data distribution in output), which can ease the one-to-many mapping problem (i.e., multiple speech variations correspond to the same text) in TTS. However, FastSpeech has several disadvantages: 1) the teacher-student distillation pipeline is complicated, 2) the duration extracted from the teacher model is not accurate enough, and the target mel-spectrograms distilled from teacher model suffer from information loss due to data simplification, both of which limit the voice quality. In this paper, we propose FastSpeech 2, which addresses the issues in FastSpeech and better solves the one-to-many mapping problem in TTS by 1) directly training the model with ground-truth target instead of the simplified output from teacher, and 2) introducing more variation information of speech (e.g., pitch, energy and more accurate duration) as conditional inputs. Specifically, we extract duration, pitch and energy from speech waveform and directly take them as conditional inputs during training and use predicted values during inference. We further design FastSpeech 2s, which is the first attempt to directly generate speech waveform from text in parallel, enjoying the benefit of full end-to-end training and even faster inference than FastSpeech. Experimental results show that 1) FastSpeech 2 and 2s outperform FastSpeech in voice quality with much simplified training pipeline and reduced training time; 2) FastSpeech 2 and 2s can match the voice quality of autoregressive models while enjoying much faster inference speed",

    "title": "On Fast Adversarial Robustness Adaptation in Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning",
    "abstract": "Model-agnostic meta-learning (MAML) has emerged as one of the most successful meta-learning techniques in few-shot learning. It enables us to learn a meta-initialization of model parameters (that we call meta-model) to rapidly adapt to new tasks using a small amount of labeled training data. Despite the generalization power of the meta-model, it remains elusive that how adversarial robustness can be maintained by MAML in few-shot learning. In addition to generalization, robustness is also desired for a meta-model to defend adversarial examples (attacks). Toward promoting adversarial robustness in MAML, we first study when a robustness-promoting regularization should be incorporated, given the fact that MAML adopts a bi-level (fine-tuning vs. meta-update) learning procedure. We show that robustifying the meta-update stage is sufficient to make robustness adapted to the task-specific fine-tuning stage even if the latter uses a standard training protocol. We also make additional justification on the acquired robustness adaptation by peering into the interpretability of neurons' activation maps. Furthermore, we investigate how robust regularization can efficiently be designed in MAML. We propose a general but easily-optimized robustness-regularized meta-learning framework, which allows the use of unlabeled data augmentation, fast adversarial attack generation, and computationally-light fine-tuning. In particular, we for the first time show that the auxiliary contrastive learning task can enhance the adversarial robustness of MAML. Finally, extensive experiments are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed methods in robust few-shot learning. Codes are available at https://github.com/wangren09/MetaAdv",

We present a stochastic differential equation (SDE) that smoothly transforms a complex data distribution to a known prior distribution by slowly injecting noise, and a corresponding reverse-time SDE that transforms the prior distribution back into the data distribution by slowly removing the noise. Crucially, the reverse-time SDE depends only on the time-dependent gradient field (\\aka, score) of the perturbed data distribution. By leveraging advances in score-based generative modeling, we can accurately estimate these scores with neural networks, and use numerical SDE solvers to generate samples. We show that this framework encapsulates previous approaches in score-based generative modeling and diffusion probabilistic modeling, allowing for new sampling procedures and new modeling capabilities. In particular, we introduce a predictor-corrector framework to correct errors in the evolution of the discretized reverse-time SDE. We also derive an equivalent neural ODE that samples from the same distribution as the SDE, but additionally enables exact likelihood computation, and improved sampling efficiency. In addition, we provide a new way to solve inverse problems with score-based models, as demonstrated with experiments on class-conditional generation, image inpainting, and colorization. Combined with multiple architectural improvements, we achieve record-breaking performance for unconditional image generation on CIFAR-10 with an Inception score of 9.89 and FID of 2.20, a competitive likelihood of 2.99 bits/dim, and demonstrate high fidelity generation of 1024 x 1024 images for the first time from a score-based generative model",

We advocate for a method that optimizes the output feature of the penultimate layer of the student network and hence is directly related to representation learning. To this end, we firstly propose a direct feature matching approach which focuses on optimizing the student's penultimate layer only. Secondly and more importantly, because feature matching does not take into account the classification problem at hand, we propose a second approach that decouples representation learning and classification and utilizes the teacher's pre-trained classifier to train the student's penultimate layer feature. In particular, for the same input image, we wish the teacher's and student's feature to produce the same output when passed through the teacher's classifier, which is achieved with a simple L2 loss. Our method is extremely simple to implement and straightforward to train and is shown to consistently outperform previous state-of-the-art methods over a large set of experimental settings including different (a) network architectures, (b) teacher-student capacities, (c) datasets, and (d) domains.

From the perspective of graph isomorphism testing, we show both theoretically and numerically that GA-MLPs with suitable operators can distinguish almost all non-isomorphic graphs, just like the Weifeiler-Lehman (WL) test. However, by viewing them as node-level functions and examining the equivalence classes they induce on rooted graphs, we prove a separation in expressive power between GA-MLPs and GNNs that grows exponentially in depth. In particular, unlike GNNs, GA-MLPs are unable to count the number of attributed walks. We also demonstrate via community detection experiments that GA-MLPs can be limited by their choice of operator family, as compared to GNNs with higher flexibility in learning",

However, NAS is typically compute-intensive because multiple models need to be evaluated before choosing the best one. To reduce the computational power and time needed, a proxy task is often used for evaluating each model instead of full training. In this paper, we evaluate conventional reduced-training proxies and quantify how well they preserve ranking between multiple models during search when compared with the rankings produced by final trained accuracy. We propose a series of zero-cost proxies, based on recent pruning literature, that use just a single minibatch of training data to compute a model's score. Our zero-cost proxies use 3 orders of magnitude less computation but can match and even outperform conventional proxies. For example, Spearman's rank correlation coefficient between final validation accuracy and our best zero-cost proxy on NAS-Bench-201 is 0.82, compared to 0.61 for EcoNAS (a recently proposed reduced-training proxy). Finally, we use these zero-cost proxies to enhance existing NAS search algorithms such as random search, reinforcement learning, evolutionary search and predictor-based search. For all search methodologies and across three different NAS datasets, we are able to significantly improve sample efficiency, and thereby decrease computation, by using our zero-cost proxies.

    "abstract": "Modern deep learning models have achieved great success in predictive accuracy for many data modalities. However, their application to many real-world tasks is restricted by poor uncertainty estimates, such as overconfidence on out-of-distribution (OOD) data and ungraceful failing under distributional shift. Previous benchmarks have found that ensembles of neural networks (NNs) are typically the best calibrated models on OOD data. Inspired by this, we leverage recent theoretical advances that characterize the function-space prior of an ensemble of infinitely-wide NNs as a Gaussian process, termed the neural network Gaussian process (NNGP). We use the NNGP with a softmax link function to build a probabilistic model for multi-class classification and marginalize over the latent Gaussian outputs to sample from the posterior. This gives us a better understanding of the implicit prior NNs place on function space and allows a direct comparison of the calibration of the NNGP and its finite-width analogue. We also examine the calibration of previous approaches to classification with the NNGP, which treat classification problems as regression to the one-hot labels. In this case the Bayesian posterior is exact, and we compare several heuristics to generate a categorical distribution over classes. We find these methods are well calibrated under distributional shift. Finally, we consider an infinite-width final layer in conjunction with a pre-trained embedding. This replicates the important practical use case of transfer learning and allows scaling to significantly larger datasets. As well as achieving competitive predictive accuracy, this approach is better calibrated than its finite width analogue",

    "title": "Better Fine-Tuning by Reducing Representational Collapse",
    "abstract": "Although widely adopted, existing approaches for fine-tuning pre-trained language models have been shown to be unstable across hyper-parameter settings, motivating recent work on trust region methods. In this paper, we present a simplified and efficient method rooted in trust region theory that replaces previously used adversarial objectives with parametric noise (sampling from either a normal or uniform distribution), thereby discouraging representation change during fine-tuning when possible without hurting performance. We also introduce a new analysis to motivate the use of trust region methods more generally, by studying representational collapse; the degradation of generalizable representations from pre-trained models as they are fine-tuned for a specific end task. Extensive experiments show that our fine-tuning method matches or exceeds the performance of previous trust region methods on a range of understanding and generation tasks (including DailyMail/CNN, Gigaword, Reddit TIFU, and the GLUE benchmark), while also being much faster. We also show that it is less prone to representation collapse; the pre-trained models maintain more generalizable representations every time they are fine-tuned",

    "abstract": "We consider the problem of learning to communicate using multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL). A common approach is to learn off-policy, using data sampled from a replay buffer. However, messages received in the past may not accurately reflect the current communication policy of each agent, and this complicates learning. We therefore introduce a 'communication correction' which accounts for the non-stationarity of observed communication induced by multi-agent learning. It works by relabelling the received message to make it likely under the communicator's current policy, and thus be a better reflection of the receiver's current environment. To account for cases in which agents are both senders and receivers, we introduce an ordered relabelling scheme. Our correction is computationally efficient and can be integrated with a range of off-policy algorithms. It substantially improves the ability of communicating MARL systems to learn across a variety of cooperative and competitive tasks",

When the nonpersistent, simpler correlations correspond to non-semantic background factors, a neural network trained on this data can exhibit dramatic failure upon encountering systematic distributional shift, where the correlating background features are recombined with different objects. We perform an empirical study on three synthetic datasets, showing that group invariance methods across inferred partitionings of the training set can lead to significant improvements at such test-time situations. We also suggest a simple invariance penalty, showing with experiments on our setups that it can perform better than alternatives. We find that even without assuming access to any systematically shifted validation sets, one can still find improvements over an ERM-trained reference model",

    "title": "CausalWorld: A Robotic Manipulation Benchmark for Causal Structure and Transfer Learning",
    "abstract": "Despite recent successes of reinforcement learning (RL), it remains a challenge for agents to transfer learned skills to related environments. To facilitate research addressing this problem, we propose CausalWorld, a benchmark for causal structure and transfer learning in a robotic manipulation environment. The environment is a simulation of an open-source robotic platform, hence offering the possibility of sim-to-real transfer. Tasks consist of constructing 3D shapes from a given set of blocks - inspired by how children learn to build complex structures. The key strength of CausalWorld is that it provides a combinatorial family of such tasks with common causal structure and underlying factors (including, e.g., robot and object masses, colors, sizes). The user (or the agent) may intervene on all causal variables, which allows for fine-grained control over how similar different tasks (or task distributions) are. One can thus easily define training and evaluation distributions of a desired difficulty level, targeting a specific form of generalization (e.g., only changes in appearance or object mass). Further, this common parametrization facilitates defining curricula by interpolating between an initial and a target task. While users may define their own task distributions, we present eight meaningful distributions as concrete benchmarks, ranging from simple to very challenging, all of which require long-horizon planning as well as precise low-level motor control. Finally, we provide baseline results for a subset of these tasks on distinct training curricula and corresponding evaluation protocols, verifying the feasibility of the tasks in this benchmark",

    "title": "Empirical or Invariant Risk Minimization? A Sample Complexity Perspective",
    "abstract": "Recently, invariant risk minimization (IRM) was proposed as a promising solution to address out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization. However, it is unclear when IRM should be preferred over the widely-employed empirical risk minimization (ERM) framework. In this work, we analyze both these frameworks from the perspective of sample complexity, thus taking a firm step towards answering this important question. We find that depending on the type of data generation mechanism, the two approaches might have very different finite sample and asymptotic behavior. For example, in the covariate shift setting we see that the two approaches not only arrive at the same asymptotic solution, but also have similar finite sample behavior with no clear winner. For other distribution shifts such as those involving confounders or anti-causal variables, however, the two approaches arrive at different asymptotic solutions where IRM is guaranteed to be close to the desired OOD solutions in the finite sample regime, while ERM is biased even asymptotically. We further investigate how different factors -- the number of environments, complexity of the model, and IRM penalty weight -- impact the sample complexity of IRM in relation to its distance from the OOD solutions",

This is extremely concerning: if the prior is accurate, Bayes inference/decision theory is optimal, and any artificial changes to the posterior should harm performance. While this suggests that the prior may be at fault, here we argue that in fact, BNNs for image classification use the wrong likelihood. In particular, standard image benchmark datasets such as CIFAR-10 are carefully curated. We develop a generative model describing curation which gives a principled Bayesian account of cold posteriors, because the likelihood under this new generative model closely matches the tempered likelihoods used in past work",

    "abstract": "Despite the widespread application of recurrent neural networks (RNNs) across a variety of tasks, a unified understanding of how RNNs solve these tasks remains elusive. In particular, it is unclear what dynamical patterns arise in trained RNNs, and how those patterns depend on the training dataset or task. This work addresses these questions in the context of a specific natural language processing task: text classification. Using tools from dynamical systems analysis, we study recurrent networks trained on a battery of both natural and synthetic text classification tasks. We find the dynamics of these trained RNNs to be both interpretable and low-dimensional. Specifically, across architectures and datasets, RNNs accumulate evidence for each class as they process the text, using a low-dimensional attractor manifold as the underlying mechanism. Moreover, the dimensionality and geometry of the attractor manifold are determined by the structure of the training dataset; in particular, we describe how simple word-count statistics computed on the training dataset can be used to predict these properties. Our observations span multiple architectures and datasets, reflecting a common mechanism RNNs employ to perform text classification. To the degree that integration of evidence towards a decision is a common computational primitive, this work lays the foundation for using dynamical systems techniques to study the inner workings of RNNs",

    "abstract": "Reinforcement learning (RL) has achieved impressive performance in a variety of online settings in which an agent's ability to query the environment for transitions and rewards is effectively unlimited. However, in many practical applications, the situation is reversed: an agent may have access to large amounts of undirected offline experience data, while access to the online environment is severely limited. In this work, we focus on this offline setting. Our main insight is that, when presented with offline data composed of a variety of behaviors, an effective way to leverage this data is to extract a continuous space of recurring and temporally extended primitive behaviors before using these primitives for downstream task learning. Primitives extracted in this way serve two purposes: they delineate the behaviors that are supported by the data from those that are not, making them useful for avoiding distributional shift in offline RL; and they provide a degree of temporal abstraction, which reduces the effective horizon yielding better learning in theory, and improved offline RL in practice. In addition to benefiting offline policy optimization, we show that performing offline primitive learning in this way can also be leveraged for improving few-shot imitation learning as well as exploration and transfer in online RL on a variety of benchmark domains.

    "title": "Grounding Language to Autonomously-Acquired Skills via Goal Generation",
    "abstract": "We are interested in the autonomous acquisition of repertoires of skills. Languageconditioned reinforcement learning (LC-RL) approaches are great tools in this quest, as they allow to express abstract goals as sets of constraints on the states. However, most LC-RL agents are not autonomous and cannot learn without external instructions and feedback. Besides, their direct language condition cannot account for the goal-directed behavior of pre-verbal infants and strongly limits the expression of behavioral diversity for a given language input. To resolve these issues, we propose a new conceptual approach to language-conditioned RL: the Language-Goal-Behavior architecture (LGB). LGB decouples skill learning and language grounding via an intermediate semantic representation of the world. To showcase the properties of LGB, we present a specific implementation called DECSTR. DECSTR is an intrinsically motivated learning agent endowed with an innate semantic representation describing spatial relations between physical objects. In a first stage (G→B), it freely explores its environment and targets selfgenerated semantic configurations. In a second stage (L→G), it trains a languageconditioned goal generator to generate semantic goals that match the constraints expressed in language-based inputs. We showcase the additional properties of LGB w.r.t. both an end-to-end LC-RL approach and a similar approach leveraging non-semantic, continuous intermediate representations. Intermediate semantic representations help satisfy language commands in a diversity of ways, enable strategy switching after a failure and facilitate language grounding",

Here we present a family of learned data augmentation schemes that support a large category of compositional generalizations without appeal to latent symbolic structure. Our approach to data augmentation has two components: recombination of original training examples via a prototype-based generative model and resampling of generated examples to encourage extrapolation. Training an ordinary neural sequence model on a dataset augmented with recombined and resampled examples significantly improves generalization in two language processing problems---instruction following (SCAN) and morphological analysis (Sigmorphon 2018)---where our approach enables learning of new constructions and tenses from as few as eight initial examples",

We present an alternative perspective and formulate federated learning as a posterior inference problem, where the goal is to infer a global posterior distribution by having client devices each infer the posterior of their local data. While exact inference is often intractable, this perspective provides a principled way to search for global optima in federated settings. Further, starting with the analysis of federated quadratic objectives, we develop a computation- and communication-efficient approximate posterior inference algorithm -- federated posterior averaging (FedPA). Our algorithm uses MCMC for approximate inference of local posteriors on the clients and efficiently communicates their statistics to the server, where the latter uses them to refine a global estimate of the posterior mode. Finally, we show that FedPA generalizes federated averaging (FedAvg), can similarly benefit from adaptive optimizers, and yields state-of-the-art results on four realistic and challenging benchmarks, converging faster, to better optima",

We demonstrate via a number of experiments that the RNTK offers significant performance gains over other kernels, including standard NTKs across a range of different data sets. A unique benefit of the RNTK is that it is agnostic to the length of the input, in stark contrast to other kernels",

    "title": "When does preconditioning help or hurt generalization?",
    "abstract": "While second order optimizers such as natural gradient descent (NGD) often speed up optimization, their effect on generalization remains controversial. For instance, it has been pointed out that gradient descent (GD), in contrast to many preconditioned updates, converges to small Euclidean norm solutions in overparameterized models, leading to favorable generalization properties. This work presents a more nuanced view on the comparison of generalization between first- and second-order methods. We provide an asymptotic bias-variance decomposition of the generalization error of overparameterized ridgeless regression under a general class of preconditioner $\\boldsymbol{P}$, and consider the inverse population Fisher information matrix (used in NGD) as a particular example. We determine the optimal $\\boldsymbol{P}$ for both the bias and variance, and find that the relative generalization performance of different optimizers depends on the label noise and the \"shape\" of the signal (true parameters): when the labels are noisy, the model is misspecified, or the signal is misaligned with the features, NGD can achieve lower risk; conversely, GD generalizes better than NGD under clean labels, a well-specified model, or aligned signal. Based on this analysis, we discuss several approaches to manage the bias-variance tradeoff, and the potential benefit of interpolating between GD and NGD. We then extend our analysis to regression in the reproducing kernel Hilbert space and demonstrate that preconditioned GD can decrease the population risk faster than GD. Lastly, we empirically compare the generalization performance of first- and second-order optimizers in neural network experiments, and observe robust trends matching our theoretical analysis",

Though statistically equivalent, it has been observed that reweighting outperforms resampling when combined with stochastic gradient algorithms. By analyzing illustrative examples, we explain the reason behind this phenomenon using tools from dynamical stability and stochastic asymptotics. We also present experiments from regression, classification, and off-policy prediction to demonstrate that this is a general phenomenon.

However, generation quality is generally inconsistent for any given model and can vary dramatically between samples.

The gradient flow takes the form of a non-linear Fokker-Plank equation, which can be easily simulated by sampling from the equivalent McKean-Vlasov process. By refining inferior samples, our technique avoids wasteful sample rejection used by previous methods (DRS & MH-GAN). Compared to existing works that focus on specific GAN variants, we show our refinement approach can be applied to GANs with vector-valued critics and even other deep generative models such as VAEs and Normalizing Flows.

    "title": "Complex Query Answering with Neural Link Predictors",
    "abstract": "Neural link predictors are immensely useful for identifying missing edges in large scale Knowledge Graphs. However, it is still not clear how to use these models for answering more complex queries that arise in a number of domains, such as queries using logical conjunctions, disjunctions, and existential quantifiers, while accounting for missing edges. In this work, we propose a framework for efficiently answering complex queries on incomplete Knowledge Graphs. We translate each query into an end-to-end differentiable objective, where the truth value of each atom is computed by a pre-trained neural link predictor. We then analyse two solutions to the optimisation problem, including gradient-based and combinatorial search. In our experiments, the proposed approach produces more accurate results than state-of-the-art methods -- black-box neural models trained on millions of generated queries -- without the need of training on a large and diverse set of complex queries. Using orders of magnitude less training data, we obtain relative improvements ranging from 8% up to 40% in Hits@3 across different knowledge graphs containing factual information. Finally, we demonstrate that it is possible to explain the outcome of our model in terms of the intermediate solutions identified for each of the complex query atoms",

    "title": "Generalized Energy Based Models",
    "abstract": "We introduce the Generalized Energy Based Model (GEBM) for generative modelling. These models combine two trained components: a base distribution (generally an implicit model), which can learn the support of data with low intrinsic dimension in a high dimensional space; and an energy function, to refine the probability mass on the learned support. Both the energy function and base jointly constitute the final model, unlike GANs, which retain only the base distribution (the \"generator\"). GEBMs are trained by alternating between learning the energy and the base. We show that both training stages are well-defined: the energy is learned by maximising a generalized likelihood, and the resulting energy-based loss provides informative gradients for learning the base. Samples from the posterior on the latent space of the trained model can be obtained via MCMC, thus finding regions in this space that produce better quality samples. Empirically, the GEBM samples on image-generation tasks are of much better quality than those from the learned generator alone, indicating that all else being equal, the GEBM will outperform a GAN of the same complexity. GEBMs also return state-of-the-art performance on density modelling tasks, and when using base measures with an explicit form",

    "abstract": "Offline learning is a key part of making reinforcement learning (RL) useable in real systems. Offline RL looks at scenarios where there is data from a system's operation, but no direct access to the system when learning a policy. Recent work on training RL policies from offline data has shown results both with model-free policies learned directly from the data, or with planning on top of learnt models of the data. Model-free policies tend to be more performant, but are more opaque, harder to command externally, and less easy to integrate into larger systems. We propose an offline learner that generates a model that can be used to control the system directly through planning. This allows us to have easily controllable policies directly from data, without ever interacting with the system. We show the performance of our algorithm, Model-Based Offline Planning (MBOP) on a series of robotics-inspired tasks, and demonstrate its ability leverage planning to respect environmental constraints. We are able to find near-optimal polices for certain simulated systems from as little as 50 seconds of real-time system interaction, and create zero-shot goal-conditioned policies on a series of environments",

We build upon the recent sign agnostic learning (SAL) approach and generalize it to include derivative data in a sign agnostic manner. In more detail, given the unsigned distance function to the input raw data, we suggest a novel sign agnostic regression loss, incorporating both pointwise values and gradients of the unsigned distance function. Optimizing this loss leads to a signed implicit function solution, the zero level set of which is a high quality, valid manifold approximation to the input 3D data. We demonstrate the efficacy of SAL++ shape space learning from two challenging datasets: ShapeNet that contains inconsistent orientation and non-manifold meshes, and D-Faust that contains raw 3D scans (triangle soups).

We refine and improve the theoretical analysis of Shalev-Shwartz et al.

This significantly generalizes associated results on sparse convex optimization, as well as rank-constrained convex optimization for smooth functions. We then introduce new practical variants of these algorithms that have superior runtime and recover better solutions in practice.

To cope with these challenges, we propose a novel, cognitively-inspired approach which trains autoencoders with Neural Style Transfer to encode and store images. During training on a new task, reconstructed images from encoded episodes are replayed in order to avoid catastrophic forgetting. The loss function for the reconstructed images is weighted to reduce its effect during classifier training to cope with image degradation. When the system runs out of memory the encoded episodes are converted into centroids and covariance matrices, which are used to generate pseudo-images during classifier training, keeping classifier performance stable while using less memory.

Here, we prove the first approximation guarantees for practical GNNs, paving the way for a better understanding of their generalization. Our theoretical results are proved for invariant GNNs computing a graph embedding (permutation of the nodes of the input graph does not affect the output) and equivariant GNNs computing an embedding of the nodes (permutation of the input permutes the output). We show that Folklore Graph Neural Networks (FGNN), which are tensor based GNNs augmented with matrix multiplication are the most expressive architectures proposed so far for a given tensor order. We illustrate our results on the Quadratic Assignment Problem (a NP-Hard combinatorial problem) by showing that FGNNs are able to learn how to solve the problem, leading to much better average performances than existing algorithms (based on spectral, SDP or other GNNs architectures).

    "abstract": "Graph neural networks have been widely used on modeling graph data, achieving impressive results on node classification and link prediction tasks. Yet, obtaining an accurate representation for a graph further requires a pooling function that maps a set of node representations into a compact form. A simple sum or average over all node representations considers all node features equally without consideration of their task relevance, and any structural dependencies among them. Recently proposed hierarchical graph pooling methods, on the other hand, may yield the same representation for two different graphs that are distinguished by the Weisfeiler-Lehman test, as they suboptimally preserve information from the node features. To tackle these limitations of existing graph pooling methods, we first formulate the graph pooling problem as a multiset encoding problem with auxiliary information about the graph structure, and propose a Graph Multiset Transformer (GMT) which is a multi-head attention based global pooling layer that captures the interaction between nodes according to their structural dependencies. We show that GMT satisfies both injectiveness and permutation invariance, such that it is at most as powerful as the Weisfeiler-Lehman graph isomorphism test. Moreover, our methods can be easily extended to the previous node clustering approaches for hierarchical graph pooling. Our experimental results show that GMT significantly outperforms state-of-the-art graph pooling methods on graph classification benchmarks with high memory and time efficiency, and obtains even larger performance gain on graph reconstruction and generation tasks.1",

In this paper, we study a novel attack paradigm, which modifies model parameters in the deployment stage for malicious purposes. Specifically, our goal is to misclassify a specific sample into a target class without any sample modification, while not significantly reduce the prediction accuracy of other samples to ensure the stealthiness. To this end, we formulate this problem as a binary integer programming (BIP), since the parameters are stored as binary bits (i.e., 0 and 1) in the memory. By utilizing the latest technique in integer programming, we equivalently reformulate this BIP problem as a continuous optimization problem, which can be effectively and efficiently solved using the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) method. Consequently, the flipped critical bits can be easily determined through optimization, rather than using a heuristic strategy. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method in attacking DNNs. The code is available at: https://github.com/jiawangbai/TA-LBF",

In contrast to the mutual information lower bound commonly used by contrastive learning, the estimate of predictive information we adopt is exact under a Gaussian assumption. Additionally, it can be computed without negative sampling. To reduce the degeneracy of the latent space extracted by powerful encoders and keep useful information from the inputs, we regularize predictive information learning with a challenging masked reconstruction loss. We demonstrate that our method recovers the latent space of noisy dynamical systems, extracts predictive features for forecasting tasks, and improves automatic speech recognition when used to pretrain the encoder on large amounts of unlabeled data",

    "title": "Improving Adversarial Robustness via Channel-wise Activation Suppressing",
    "abstract": "The study of adversarial examples and their activation has attracted significant attention for secure and robust learning with deep neural networks (DNNs). Different from existing works, in this paper, we highlight two new characteristics of adversarial examples from the channel-wise activation perspective: 1) the activation magnitudes of adversarial examples are higher than that of natural examples; and 2) the channels are activated more uniformly by adversarial examples than natural examples. We find that the state-of-the-art defense adversarial training has addressed the first issue of high activation magnitudes via training on adversarial examples, while the second issue of uniform activation remains. This motivates us to suppress redundant activation from being activated by adversarial perturbations via a Channel-wise Activation Suppressing (CAS) strategy. We show that CAS can train a model that inherently suppresses adversarial activation, and can be easily applied to existing defense methods to further improve their robustness. Our work provides a simple but generic training strategy for robustifying the intermediate layer activation of DNNs. Code is available at https://github.com/bymavis/CAS_ICLR2021",

A large class of latent variable models, such as adversarial clustering, mixed membership stochastic block models, and topic models can be cast as learning a latent simplex. Bhattacharyya and Kannan (SODA, 2020) give an algorithm for learning such a latent simplex in time roughly $(: · nnz(A)), where nnz(A) is the number of non-zeros in A. We show that the dependence on : in the running time is unnecessary given a natural assumption about the mass of the top : singular values of A, which holds in many of these applications. Further, we show this assumption is necessary, as otherwise an algorithm for learning a latent simplex would imply an algorithmic breakthrough for spectral low rank approximation. At a high level, Bhattacharyya and Kannan provide an adaptive algorithm that makes : matrix-vector product queries to A and each query is a function of all queries preceding it. Since each matrix-vector product requires nnz(A) time, their overall running time appears unavoidable. Instead, we obtain a low-rank approximation to A in input-sparsity time and show that the column space thus obtained has small sinΘ (angular) distance to the right top-: singular space of A. Our algorithm then selects : points in the low-rank subspace with the largest inner product (in absolute value) with : carefully chosen random vectors. By working in the low-rank subspace, we avoid reading the entire matrix in each iteration and thus circumvent the Θ(: · nnz(A)) running time",

In this paper we show how to effectively and efficiently learn such functions using Kronecker-Factored Lattice (KFL), an efficient reparameterization of flexible monotonic lattice regression via Kronecker product. Both computational and storage costs scale linearly in the number of input features, which is a significant improvement over existing methods that grow exponentially. We also show that we can still properly enforce monotonicity and other shape constraints. The KFL function class consists of products of piecewise-linear functions, and the size of the function class can be further increased through ensembling. We prove that the function class of an ensemble of M base KFL models strictly increases as M increases up to a certain threshold. Beyond this threshold, every multilinear interpolated lattice function can be expressed. Our experimental results demonstrate that KFL trains faster with fewer parameters while still achieving accuracy and evaluation speeds comparable to or better than the baseline methods and preserving monotonicity guarantees on the learned model",

    "abstract": "In the recent literature of Graph Neural Networks (GNN), the expressive power of models has been studied through their capability to distinguish if two given graphs are isomorphic or not. Since the graph isomorphism problem is NP-intermediate, and Weisfeiler-Lehman (WL) test can give sufficient but not enough evidence in polynomial time, the theoretical power of GNNs is usually evaluated by the equivalence of WL-test order, followed by an empirical analysis of the models on some reference inductive and transductive datasets. However, such analysis does not account the signal processing pipeline, whose capability is generally evaluated in the spectral domain. In this paper, we argue that a spectral analysis of GNNs behavior can provide a complementary point of view to go one step further in the understanding of GNNs. By bridging the gap between the spectral and spatial design of graph convolutions, we theoretically demonstrate some equivalence of the graph convolution process regardless it is designed in the spatial or the spectral domain. Using this connection, we managed to re-formulate most of the state-of-the-art graph neural networks into one common framework. This general framework allows to lead a spectral analysis of the most popular GNNs, explaining their performance and showing their limits according to spectral point of view. Our theoretical spectral analysis is confirmed by experiments on various graph databases. Furthermore, we demonstrate the necessity of high and/or band-pass filters on a graph dataset, while the majority of GNN is limited to only low-pass and inevitably it fails.

A commonly-used (first-order) influence function can be implemented efficiently as a post-hoc method requiring access only to the gradients and Hessian of the model. For linear models, influence functions are well-defined due to the convexity of the underlying loss function and are generally accurate even across difficult settings where model changes are fairly large such as estimating group influences. Influence functions, however, are not well-understood in the context of deep learning with non-convex loss functions. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive and large-scale empirical study of successes and failures of influence functions in neural network models trained on datasets such as Iris, MNIST, CIFAR-10 and ImageNet. Through our extensive experiments, we show that the network architecture, its depth and width, as well as the extent of model parameterization and regularization techniques have strong effects in the accuracy of influence functions. In particular, we find that (i) influence estimates are fairly accurate for shallow networks, while for deeper networks the estimates are often erroneous; (ii) for certain network architectures and datasets, training with weight-decay regularization is important to get high-quality influence estimates; and (iii) the accuracy of influence estimates can vary significantly depending on the examined test points.

    "abstract": "Neural text decoding algorithms strongly influence the quality of texts generated using language models, but popular algorithms like top-k, top-p (nucleus), and temperature-based sampling may yield texts that have objectionable repetition or incoherence. Although these methods generate high-quality text after ad hoc parameter tuning that depends on the language model and the length of generated text, not much is known about the control they provide over the statistics of the output. This is important, however, since recent reports show that humans prefer when perplexity is neither too much nor too little and since we experimentally show that cross-entropy (log of perplexity) has a near-linear relation with repetition. First we provide a theoretical analysis of perplexity in top-k, top-p, and temperature sampling, under Zipfian statistics. Then, we use this analysis to design a feedback-based adaptive top-k text decoding algorithm called mirostat that generates text (of any length) with a predetermined target value of perplexity without any tuning. Experiments show that for low values of k and p, perplexity drops significantly with generated text length and leads to excessive repetitions (the boredom trap). Contrarily, for large values of k and p, perplexity increases with generated text length and leads to incoherence (confusion trap). Mirostat avoids both traps. Specifically, we show that setting target perplexity value beyond a threshold yields negligible sentence-level repetitions. Experiments with human raters for fluency, coherence, and quality further verify our findings",

Consequently, the learned generative model is compromised. We demonstrate these theoretical findings in three scenarios: traffic flow, handwritten digits, and aerial vehicle dynamics. Using fully-conditioned approximate posteriors, performance improves in terms of generative modelling and multi-step prediction",

    "title": "Neurally Augmented ALISTA",
    "abstract": "It is well-established that many iterative sparse reconstruction algorithms can be unrolled to yield a learnable neural network for improved empirical performance. A prime example is learned ISTA (LISTA) where weights, step sizes and thresholds are learned from training data. Recently, Analytic LISTA (ALISTA) has been introduced, combining the strong empirical performance of a fully learned approach like LISTA, while retaining theoretical guarantees of classical compressed sensing algorithms and significantly reducing the number of parameters to learn. However, these parameters are trained to work in expectation, often leading to suboptimal reconstruction of individual targets. In this work we therefore introduce Neurally Augmented ALISTA, in which an LSTM network is used to compute step sizes and thresholds individually for each target vector during reconstruction. This adaptive approach is theoretically motivated by revisiting the recovery guarantees of ALISTA. We show that our approach further improves empirical performance in sparse reconstruction, in particular outperforming existing algorithms by an increasing margin as the compression ratio becomes more challenging",

    "abstract": "We present lambda layers – an alternative framework to self-attention – for capturing long-range interactions between an input and structured contextual information (e.g. a pixel surrounded by other pixels). Lambda layers capture such interactions by transforming available contexts into linear functions, termed lambdas, and applying these linear functions to each input separately. Similar to linear attention, lambda layers bypass expensive attention maps, but in contrast, they model both content and position-based interactions which enables their application to large structured inputs such as images. The resulting neural network architectures, LambdaNetworks, significantly outperform their convolutional and attentional counterparts on ImageNet classification, COCO object detection and instance segmentation, while being more computationally efficient. Additionally, we design LambdaResNets, a family of hybrid architectures across different scales, that considerably improves the speed-accuracy tradeoff of image classification models. LambdaResNets reach excellent accuracies on ImageNet while being 3.2 4.4x faster than the popular EfficientNets on modern machine learning accelerators. In large-scale semi-supervised training with an additinal 130M pseudo-labeled images, LambdaResNets achieve up to 86.7% ImageNet accuracy while being 9.5x faster than EfficientNet NoisyStudent and 9x faster than a Vision Transformer with comparable accuracies1",

    "title": "Predicting Infectiousness for Proactive Contact Tracing",
    "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic has spread rapidly worldwide, overwhelming manual contact tracing in many countries and resulting in widespread lockdowns for emergency containment. Large-scale digital contact tracing (DCT) has emerged as a potential solution to resume economic and social activity while minimizing spread of the virus. Various DCT methods have been proposed, each making trade-offs between privacy, mobility restrictions, and public health. The most common approach, binary contact tracing (BCT), models infection as a binary event, informed only by an individual's test results, with corresponding binary recommendations that either all or none of the individual's contacts quarantine. BCT ignores the inherent uncertainty in contacts and the infection process, which could be used to tailor messaging to high-risk individuals, and prompt proactive testing or earlier warnings. It also does not make use of observations such as symptoms or pre-existing medical conditions, which could be used to make more accurate infectiousness predictions. In this paper, we use a recently-proposed COVID-19 epidemiological simulator to develop and test methods that can be deployed to a smartphone to locally and proactively predict an individual's infectiousness (risk of infecting others) based on their contact history and other information, while respecting strong privacy constraints. Predictions are used to provide personalized recommendations to the individual via an app, as well as to send anonymized messages to the individual's contacts, who use this information to better predict their own infectiousness, an approach we call proactive contact tracing (PCT). We find a deep-learning based PCT method which improves over BCT for equivalent average mobility, suggesting PCT could help in safe re-opening and second-wave prevention",

We discuss the potential difference in flexibility between invertible flows for discrete random variables and flows for continuous random variables and show that (integer) discrete flows are more flexible than previously claimed.

    "abstract": "Deep learning models require a large amount of data to perform well. When data is scarce for a target task, we can transfer the knowledge gained by training on similar tasks to quickly learn the target. A successful approach is meta-learning, or learning to learn a distribution of tasks, where learning is represented by an outer loop, and to learn by an inner loop of gradient descent. However, a number of recent empirical studies argue that the inner loop is unnecessary and more simple models work equally well or even better. We study the performance of MAML as a function of the learning rate of the inner loop, where zero learning rate implies that there is no inner loop. Using random matrix theory and exact solutions of linear models, we calculate an algebraic expression for the test loss of MAML applied to mixed linear regression and nonlinear regression with overparameterized models. Surprisingly, while the optimal learning rate for adaptation is positive, we find that the optimal learning rate for training is always negative, a setting that has never been considered before. Therefore, not only does the performance increase by decreasing the learning rate to zero, as suggested by recent work, but it can be increased even further by decreasing the learning rate to negative values. These results help clarify under what circumstances meta-learning performs best",

We propose that such a struggle to achieve and preserve order might offer a principle for the emergence of useful behaviors in artificial agents. We formalize this idea into an unsupervised reinforcement learning method called surprise minimizing reinforcement learning (SMiRL). SMiRL alternates between learning a density model to evaluate the surprise of a stimulus, and improving the policy to seek more predictable stimuli. The policy seeks out stable and repeatable situations that counteract the environment's prevailing sources of entropy. This might include avoiding other hostile agents, or finding a stable, balanced pose for a bipedal robot in the face of disturbance forces. We demonstrate that our surprise minimizing agents can successfully play Tetris, Doom, control a humanoid to avoid falls, and navigate to escape enemies in a maze without any task-specific reward supervision. We further show that SMiRL can be used together with standard task rewards to accelerate reward-driven learning",

We theoretically characterize the tradeoff between safety and policy improvement, show that the safety constraints are likely to be satisfied with high probability during training, derive provable convergence guarantees for our approach, which is no worse asymptotically than standard RL, and demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approach on a suite of challenging navigation, manipulation, and locomotion tasks. Empirically, we show that the proposed approach can achieve competitive task performance while incurring significantly lower catastrophic failure rates during training than prior methods.

    "title": "Blending MPC & Value Function Approximation for Efficient Reinforcement Learning",
    "abstract": "Model-Predictive Control (MPC) is a powerful tool for controlling complex, real-world systems that uses a model to make predictions about future behavior. For each state encountered, MPC solves an online optimization problem to choose a control action that will minimize future cost. This is a surprisingly effective strategy, but real-time performance requirements warrant the use of simple models. If the model is not sufficiently accurate, then the resulting controller can be biased, limiting performance. We present a framework for improving on MPC with model-free reinforcement learning (RL). The key insight is to view MPC as constructing a series of local Q-function approximations. We show that by using a parameter $\\lambda$, similar to the trace decay parameter in TD($\\lambda$), we can systematically trade-off learned value estimates against the local Q-function approximations. We present a theoretical analysis that shows how error from inaccurate models in MPC and value function estimation in RL can be balanced. We further propose an algorithm that changes $\\lambda$ over time to reduce the dependence on MPC as our estimates of the value function improve, and test the efficacy our approach on challenging high-dimensional manipulation tasks with biased models in simulation. We demonstrate that our approach can obtain performance comparable with MPC with access to true dynamics even under severe model bias and is more sample efficient as compared to model-free RL",

    "abstract": "Building interpretable parameterizations of real-world decision-making on the basis of demonstrated behavior--i.e. trajectories of observations and actions made by an expert maximizing some unknown reward function--is essential for introspecting and auditing policies in different institutions. In this paper, we propose learning explanations of expert decisions by modeling their reward function in terms of preferences with respect to ``\"what if'' outcomes: Given the current history of observations, what would happen if we took a particular action? To learn these cost-benefit tradeoffs associated with the expert's actions, we integrate counterfactual reasoning into batch inverse reinforcement learning. This offers a principled way of defining reward functions and explaining expert behavior, and also satisfies the constraints of real-world decision-making---where active experimentation is often impossible (e.g. in healthcare). Additionally, by estimating the effects of different actions, counterfactuals readily tackle the off-policy nature of policy evaluation in the batch setting, and can naturally accommodate settings where the expert policies depend on histories of observations rather than just current states. Through illustrative experiments in both real and simulated medical environments, we highlight the effectiveness of our batch, counterfactual inverse reinforcement learning approach in recovering accurate and interpretable descriptions of behavior",

Separately, a recent line of work has shown that deep networks trained with gradient descent may behave like (tractable) kernel methods in a certain over-parameterized regime, where the kernel is determined by the architecture and initialization, and this paper focuses on approximation for such kernels. We show that for ReLU activations, the kernels derived from deep fully-connected networks have essentially the same approximation properties as their \"shallow\" two-layer counterpart, namely the same eigenvalue decay for the corresponding integral operator. This highlights the limitations of the kernel framework for understanding the benefits of such deep architectures. Our main theoretical result relies on characterizing such eigenvalue decays through differentiability properties of the kernel function, which also easily applies to the study of other kernels defined on the sphere",

In this work we show, for the first time, that we can successfully train generative models which utilize binary neural networks. This reduces the computational cost of the models massively. We develop a new class of binary weight normalization, and provide insights for architecture designs of these binarized generative models. We demonstrate that two state-of-the-art deep generative models, the ResNet VAE and Flow++ models, can be binarized effectively using these techniques.

Weak supervision offers a promising alternative for producing labeled datasets without ground truth annotations by generating probabilistic labels using multiple noisy heuristics. This process can scale to large datasets and has demonstrated state of the art performance in diverse domains such as healthcare and e-commerce. One practical issue with learning from user-generated heuristics is that their creation requires creativity, foresight, and domain expertise from those who hand-craft them, a process which can be tedious and subjective. We develop the first framework for interactive weak supervision in which a method proposes heuristics and learns from user feedback given on each proposed heuristic. Our experiments demonstrate that only a small number of feedback iterations are needed to train models that achieve highly competitive test set performance without access to ground truth training labels. We conduct user studies, which show that users are able to effectively provide feedback on heuristics and that test set results track the performance of simulated oracles",

    "title": "Contemplating Real-World Object Classification",
    "abstract": "Deep object recognition models have been very successful over benchmark datasets such as ImageNet. How accurate and robust are they to distribution shifts arising from natural and synthetic variations in datasets? Prior research on this problem has primarily focused on ImageNet variations (e.g., ImageNetV2, ImageNet-A). To avoid potential inherited biases in these studies, we take a different approach. Specifically, we reanalyze the ObjectNet dataset1 recently proposed by Barbu et al. containing objects in daily life situations. They showed a dramatic performance drop of the state of the art object recognition models on this dataset. Due to the importance and implications of their results regarding the generalization ability of deep models, we take a second look at their analysis. We find that applying deep models to the isolated objects, rather than the entire scene as is done in the original paper, results in around 20-30% performance improvement. Relative to the numbers reported in Barbu et al., around 10-15% of the performance loss is recovered, without any test time data augmentation. Despite this gain, however, we conclude that deep models still suffer drastically on the ObjectNet dataset. We also investigate the robustness of models against synthetic image perturbations such as geometric transformations (e.g., scale, rotation, translation), natural image distortions (e.g., impulse noise, blur) as well as adversarial attacks (e.g., FGSM and PGD-5). Our results indicate that limiting the object area as much as possible (i.e., from the entire image to the bounding box to the segmentation mask) leads to consistent improvement in accuracy and robustness. Finally, through a qualitative analysis of ObjectNet data, we find that i) a large number of images in this dataset are hard to recognize even for humans, and ii) easy (hard) samples for models match with easy (hard) samples for humans. Overall, our analyses show that ObjecNet is still a challenging test platform for evaluating the generalization ability of models.

Indeed, this type of data usually consists in short time series with missing or noisy values for which causal inference is increasingly difficult. In this work, we propose a method to uncover causal relations in chaotic dynamical systems from short, noisy and sporadic time series (that is, incomplete observations at infrequent and irregular intervals) where the classical convergent cross mapping (CCM) fails. Our method works by learning a Neural ODE latent process modeling the state-space dynamics of the time series and by checking the existence of a continuous map between the resulting processes.

We provide an analysis of the one-dimensional case, proving for a simple manifold configuration that when the network depth $L$ is large relative to certain geometric and statistical properties of the data, the network width $n$ grows as a sufficiently large polynomial in $L$, and the number of i.i.d. samples from the manifolds is polynomial in $L$, randomly-initialized gradient descent rapidly learns to classify the two manifolds perfectly with high probability. Our analysis demonstrates concrete benefits of depth and width in the context of a practically-motivated model problem: the depth acts as a fitting resource, with larger depths corresponding to smoother networks that can more readily separate the class manifolds, and the width acts as a statistical resource, enabling concentration of the randomly-initialized network and its gradients. The argument centers around the neural tangent kernel and its role in the nonasymptotic analysis of training overparameterized neural networks; to this literature, we contribute essentially optimal rates of concentration for the neural tangent kernel of deep fully-connected networks, requiring width $n \\gtrsim L\\,\\mathrm{poly}(d_0)$ to achieve uniform concentration of the initial kernel over a $d_0$-dimensional submanifold of the unit sphere $\\mathbb{S}^{n_0-1}$, and a nonasymptotic framework for establishing generalization of networks trained in the NTK regime with structured data.

    "title": "Graph Coarsening with Neural Networks",
    "abstract": "As large-scale graphs become increasingly more prevalent, it poses significant computational challenges to process, extract and analyze large graph data. Graph coarsening is one popular technique to reduce the size of a graph while maintaining essential properties. Despite rich graph coarsening literature, there is only limited exploration of data-driven methods in the field. In this work, we leverage the recent progress of deep learning on graphs for graph coarsening. We first propose a framework for measuring the quality of coarsening algorithm and show that depending on the goal, we need to carefully choose the Laplace operator on the coarse graph and associated projection/lift operators. Motivated by the observation that the current choice of edge weight for the coarse graph may be suboptimal, we parametrize the weight assignment map with graph neural networks and train it to improve the coarsening quality in an unsupervised way. Through extensive experiments on both synthetic and real networks, we demonstrate that our method significantly improves common graph coarsening methods under various metrics, reduction ratios, graph sizes, and graph types. It generalizes to graphs of larger size (25× of training graphs), is adaptive to different losses (differentiable and non-differentiable), and scales to much larger graphs than previous work",

Often the constraint thresholds are incorrectly set due to the complex nature of a system or the inability to verify the thresholds offline (e.g, no simulator or reasonable offline evaluation procedure exists). This results in solutions where a task cannot be solved without violating the constraints. However, in many real-world cases, constraint violations are undesirable yet they are not catastrophic, motivating the need for soft-constrained RL approaches. We present two soft-constrained RL approaches that utilize meta-gradients to find a good trade-off between expected return and minimizing constraint violations. We demonstrate the effectiveness of these approaches by showing that they consistently outperform the baselines across four different Mujoco domains",

However, existing meta-learning methods learn complex representations across prior labeled tasks without imposing any structure on the learned representations. Here we propose COMET, a meta-learning method that improves generalization ability by learning to learn along human-interpretable concept dimensions. Instead of learning a joint unstructured metric space, COMET learns mappings of high-level concepts into semi-structured metric spaces, and effectively combines the outputs of independent concept learners. We evaluate our model on few-shot tasks from diverse domains, including fine-grained image classification, document categorization and cell type annotation on a novel dataset from a biological domain developed in our work.

Addressing heteroskedasticity and imbalance simultaneously is under-explored. We propose a data-dependent regularization technique for heteroskedastic datasets that regularizes different regions of the input space differently. Inspired by the theoretical derivation of the optimal regularization strength in a one-dimensional nonparametric classification setting, our approach adaptively regularizes the data points in higher-uncertainty, lower-density regions more heavily. We test our method on several benchmark tasks, including a real-world heteroskedastic and imbalanced dataset, WebVision.

    "title": "Autoregressive Entity Retrieval",
    "abstract": "Entities are at the center of how we represent and aggregate knowledge. For instance, Encyclopedias such as Wikipedia are structured by entities (e.g., one per article). The ability to retrieve such entities given a query is fundamental for knowledge-intensive tasks such as entity linking and open-domain question answering. One way to understand current approaches is as classifiers among atomic labels, one for each entity. Their weight vectors are dense entity representations produced by encoding entity information such as descriptions. This approach leads to several shortcomings: i) context and entity affinity is mainly captured through a vector dot product, potentially missing fine-grained interactions between the two; ii) a large memory footprint is needed to store dense representations when considering large entity sets; iii) an appropriately hard set of negative data has to be subsampled at training time. We propose GENRE, the first system that retrieves entities by generating their unique names, left to right, token-by-token in an autoregressive fashion, and conditioned on the context. This enables to mitigate the aforementioned technical issues: i) the autoregressive formulation allows us to directly capture relations between context and entity name, effectively cross encoding both; ii) the memory footprint is greatly reduced because the parameters of our encoder-decoder architecture scale with vocabulary size, not entity count; iii) the exact softmax loss can be efficiently computed without the need to subsample negative data. We show the efficacy of the approach with more than 20 datasets on entity disambiguation, end-to-end entity linking and document retrieval tasks, achieving new SOTA, or very competitive results while using a tiny fraction of the memory of competing systems. Finally, we demonstrate that new entities can be added by simply specifying their unambiguous name",

In this paper, we hypothesize that deep neural networks are regularized through their ability to extract meaningful clusters among the samples of a class. This constitutes an implicit form of regularization, as no explicit training mechanisms or supervision target such behaviour. To support our hypothesis, we design four different measures of intraclass clustering, based on the neuronand layer-level representations of the training data. We then show that these measures constitute accurate predictors of generalization performance across variations of a large set of hyperparameters (learning rate, batch size, optimizer, weight decay, dropout rate, data augmentation, network depth and width)",

Imitation learning methods aim to replicate such capabilities, however, they generally depend on access to a full set of optimal states and actions taken with the agent's actuators and from the agent's point of view. In this paper, we introduce a new algorithm – called Disentangling Generative Adversarial Imitation Learning (DisentanGAIL) – with the purpose of bypassing such constraints. Our algorithm enables autonomous agents to learn directly from high dimensional observations of an expert performing a task, by making use of adversarial learning with a latent representation inside the discriminator network. Such latent representation is regularized through mutual information constraints to incentivize learning only features that encode information about the completion levels of the task being demonstrated. This allows to obtain a shared feature space to successfully perform imitation while disregarding the differences between the expert's and the agent's domains. Empirically, our algorithm is able to efficiently imitate in a diverse range of control problems including balancing, manipulation and locomotive tasks, while being robust to various domain differences in terms of both environment appearance and agent embodiment",

We demonstrate that this additional term can be interpreted as a projection of the conditional probability given by a classifier's output to the uniform distribution. By applying the Pythagorean theorem for KL divergence, we then prove that this projection may (in theory) improve the performance of continual learning methods. In our extensive experimental results, we apply CPR to several state-of-the-art regularization-based continual learning methods and benchmark performance on popular image recognition datasets. Our results demonstrate that CPR indeed promotes a wide local minima and significantly improves both accuracy and plasticity while simultaneously mitigating the catastrophic forgetting of baseline continual learning methods",

    "abstract": "We tackle a challenging blind image denoising problem, in which only single distinct noisy images are available for training a denoiser, and no information about noise is known, except for it being zero-mean, additive, and independent of the clean image. In such a setting, which often occurs in practice, it is not possible to train a denoiser with the standard discriminative training or with the recently developed Noise2Noise (N2N) training; the former requires the underlying clean image for the given noisy image, and the latter requires two independently realized noisy image pair for a clean image. To that end, we propose GAN2GAN (GeneratedArtificial-Noise to Generated-Artificial-Noise) method that first learns a generative model that can 1) simulate the noise in the given noisy images and 2) generate a rough, noisy estimates of the clean images, then 3) iteratively trains a denoiser with subsequently synthesized noisy image pairs (as in N2N), obtained from the generative model. In results, we show the denoiser trained with our GAN2GAN achieves an impressive denoising performance on both synthetic and real-world datasets for the blind denoising setting; it almost approaches the performance of the standard discriminatively-trained or N2N-trained models that have more information than ours, and it significantly outperforms the recent baseline for the same setting, e.g., Noise2Void, and a more conventional yet strong one, BM3D.

    "abstract": "In recent years, Generative Adversarial Networks have become ubiquitous in both research and public perception, but how GANs convert an unstructured latent code to a high quality output is still an open question. In this work, we investigate regression into the latent space as a probe to understand the compositional properties of GANs. We find that combining the regressor and a pretrained generator provides a strong image prior, allowing us to create composite images from a collage of random image parts at inference time while maintaining global consistency. To compare compositional properties across different generators, we measure the trade-offs between reconstruction of the unrealistic input and image quality of the regenerated samples. We find that the regression approach enables more localized editing of individual image parts compared to direct editing in the latent space, and we conduct experiments to quantify this independence effect. Our method is agnostic to the semantics of edits, and does not require labels or predefined concepts during training. Beyond image composition, our method extends to a number of related applications, such as image inpainting or example-based image editing, which we demonstrate on several GANs and datasets, and because it uses only a single forward pass, it can operate in real-time.

    "abstract": "Despite their elegant formulation and lightweight memory cost, neural ordinary differential equations (NODEs) suffer from known representational limitations. In particular, the single flow learned by NODEs cannot express all homeomorphisms from a given data space to itself, and their static weight parametrization restricts the type of functions they can learn compared to discrete architectures with layer-dependent weights. Here, we describe a new module called neurally-controlled ODE (N-CODE) designed to improve the expressivity of NODEs. The parameters of N-CODE modules are dynamic variables governed by a trainable map from initial or current activation state, resulting in forms of open-loop and closed-loop control, respectively. A single module is sufficient for learning a distribution on non-autonomous flows that adaptively drive neural representations. We provide theoretical and empirical evidence that N-CODE circumvents limitations of previous models and show how increased model expressivity manifests in several domains. In supervised learning, we demonstrate that our framework achieves better performance than NODEs as measured by both training speed and testing accuracy. In unsupervised learning, we apply this control perspective to an image Autoencoder endowed with a latent transformation flow, greatly improving representational power over a vanilla model and leading to state-of-the-art image reconstruction on CIFAR-10",

    "abstract": "Dimensionality reduction methods for count data are critical to a wide range of applications in medical informatics and other fields where model interpretability is paramount. For such data, hierarchical Poisson matrix factorization (HPF) and other sparse probabilistic non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) methods are considered to be interpretable generative models. They consist of sparse transformations for decoding their learned representations into predictions. However, sparsity in representation decoding does not necessarily imply sparsity in the encoding of representations from the original data features. HPF is often incorrectly interpreted in the literature as if it possesses encoder sparsity. The distinction between decoder sparsity and encoder sparsity is subtle but important. Due to the lack of encoder sparsity, HPF does not possess the column-clustering property of classical NMF -- the factor loading matrix does not sufficiently define how each factor is formed from the original features. We address this deficiency by self-consistently enforcing encoder sparsity, using a generalized additive model (GAM), thereby allowing one to relate each representation coordinate to a subset of the original data features. In doing so, the method also gains the ability to perform feature selection. We demonstrate our method on simulated data and give an example of how encoder sparsity is of practical use in a concrete application of representing inpatient comorbidities in Medicare patients",

    "abstract": "Custom voice, a specific text to speech (TTS) service in commercial speech platforms, aims to adapt a source TTS model to synthesize personal voice for a target speaker using few speech from her/him. Custom voice presents two unique challenges for TTS adaptation: 1) to support diverse customers, the adaptation model needs to handle diverse acoustic conditions which could be very different from source speech data, and 2) to support a large number of customers, the adaptation parameters need to be small enough for each target speaker to reduce memory usage while maintaining high voice quality. In this work, we propose AdaSpeech, an adaptive TTS system for high-quality and efficient customization of new voices. We design several techniques in AdaSpeech to address the two challenges in custom voice: 1) To handle different acoustic conditions, we model the acoustic information in both utterance and phoneme level. Specifically, we use one acoustic encoder to extract an utterance-level vector and another one to extract a sequence of phoneme-level vectors from the target speech during pre-training and fine-tuning; in inference, we extract the utterance-level vector from a reference speech and use an acoustic predictor to predict the phonemelevel vectors. 2) To better trade off the adaptation parameters and voice quality, we introduce conditional layer normalization in the mel-spectrogram decoder of AdaSpeech, and fine-tune this part in addition to speaker embedding for adaptation. We pre-train the source TTS model on LibriTTS datasets and fine-tune it on VCTK and LJSpeech datasets (with different acoustic conditions from LibriTTS) with few adaptation data, e.g., 20 sentences, about 1 minute speech. Experiment results show that AdaSpeech achieves much better adaptation quality than baseline methods, with only about 5K specific parameters for each speaker, which demonstrates its effectiveness for custom voice.

Very recently, it is shown that under certain margin assumption on the training data, a polylogarithmic width condition suffices for two-layer ReLU networks to converge and generalize (Ji and Telgarsky, 2019). However, how much over-parameterization is sufficient to guarantee optimization and generalization for deep neural networks still remains an open question. In this work, we establish sharp optimization and generalization guarantees for deep ReLU networks. Under various assumptions made in previous work, our optimization and generalization guarantees hold with network width polylogarithmic in $n$ and $\\epsilon^{-1}$.

    "title": "FedBE: Making Bayesian Model Ensemble Applicable to Federated Learning",
    "abstract": "Federated learning aims to collaboratively train a strong global model by accessing users' locally trained models but not their own data. A crucial step is therefore to aggregate local models into a global model, which has been shown challenging when users have non-i.i.d. data. In this paper, we propose a novel aggregation algorithm named FEDBE, which takes a Bayesian inference perspective by sampling higher-quality global models and combining them via Bayesian model Ensemble, leading to much robust aggregation. We show that an effective model distribution can be constructed by simply fitting a Gaussian or Dirichlet distribution to the local models. Our empirical studies validate FEDBE's superior performance, especially when users' data are not i.i.d. and when the neural networks go deeper. Moreover, FEDBE is compatible with recent efforts in regularizing users' model training, making it an easily applicable module: you only need to replace the aggregation method but leave other parts of your federated learning algorithm intact.

    "abstract": "In open question answering (QA), the answer to a question is produced by retrieving and then analyzing documents that might contain answers to the question. Most open QA systems have considered only retrieving information from unstructured text. Here we consider for the first time open QA over both tabular and textual data and present a new large-scale dataset Open Table-and-Text Question Answering (OTT-QA) to evaluate performance on this task. Most questions in OTT-QA require multi-hop inference across tabular data and unstructured text, and the evidence required to answer a question can be distributed in different ways over these two types of input, making evidence retrieval challenging -- our baseline model using an iterative retriever and BERT-based reader achieves an exact match score less than 10%. We then propose two novel techniques to address the challenge of retrieving and aggregating evidence for OTT-QA. The first technique is to use \"early fusion\" to group multiple highly relevant tabular and textual units into a fused block, which provides more context for the retriever to search for. The second technique is to use a cross-block reader to model the cross-dependency between multiple retrieved evidence with global-local sparse attention. Combining these two techniques improves the score significantly, to above 27%",

In contrast, the common SGD noise directly applied to model parameters does not. We formalize the differences and connections of SGD noise variants, showing that SLN induces SGD noise dependent on the sharpness of output landscape and the confidence of output probability, which may help escape from sharp minima and prevent overconfidence. SLN not only improves generalization in its simplest form but also boosts popular robust training methods, including sample selection and label correction.

    "abstract": "Recently, a variety of probing tasks are proposed to discover linguistic properties learned in contextualized word embeddings. Many of these works implicitly assume these embeddings lay in certain metric spaces, typically the Euclidean space. This work considers a family of geometrically special spaces, the hyperbolic spaces, that exhibit better inductive biases for hierarchical structures and may better reveal linguistic hierarchies encoded in contextualized representations. We introduce a Poincaré probe, a structural probe projecting these embeddings into a Poincaré subspace with explicitly defined hierarchies. We focus on two probing objectives: (a) dependency trees where the hierarchy is defined as headdependent structures; (b) lexical sentiments where the hierarchy is defined as the polarity of words (positivity and negativity). We argue that a key desideratum of a probe is its sensitivity to the existence of linguistic structures. We apply our probes on BERT, a typical contextualized embedding model. In a syntactic subspace, our probe better recovers tree structures than Euclidean probes, revealing the possibility that the geometry of BERT syntax may not necessarily be Euclidean. In a sentiment subspace, we reveal two possible meta-embeddings for positive and negative sentiments and show how lexically-controlled contextualization would change the geometric localization of embeddings. We demonstrate the findings with our Poincaré probe via extensive experiments and visualization1",

    "title": "Neural Architecture Search on ImageNet in Four GPU Hours: A Theoretically Inspired Perspective",
    "abstract": "Neural Architecture Search (NAS) has been explosively studied to automate the discovery of top-performer neural networks. Current works require heavy training of supernet or intensive architecture evaluations, thus suffering from heavy resource consumption and often incurring search bias due to truncated training or approximations. Can we select the best neural architectures without involving any training and eliminate a drastic portion of the search cost? We provide an affirmative answer, by proposing a novel framework called training-free neural architecture search (TE-NAS). TE-NAS ranks architectures by analyzing the spectrum of the neural tangent kernel (NTK) and the number of linear regions in the input space. Both are motivated by recent theory advances in deep networks and can be computed without any training and any label. We show that: (1) these two measurements imply the trainability and expressivity of a neural network; (2) they strongly correlate with the network's test accuracy. Further on, we design a pruning-based NAS mechanism to achieve a more flexible and superior trade-off between the trainability and expressivity during the search. In NAS-Bench-201 and DARTS search spaces, TE-NAS completes high-quality search but only costs 0.5 and 4 GPU hours with one 1080Ti on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet, respectively. We hope our work inspires more attempts in bridging the theoretical findings of deep networks and practical impacts in real NAS applications.

To generate a synthetic training example to be shared among the distributed learners, InstaHide takes a convex combination of private feature vectors and randomly flips the sign of each entry of the resulting vector with probability 1/2. A salient question is whether this scheme is secure in any provable sense, perhaps under a plausible hardness assumption and assuming the distributions generating the public and private data satisfy certain properties.   We show that the answer to this appears to be quite subtle and closely related to the average-case complexity of a new multi-task, missing-data version of the classic problem of phase retrieval. Motivated by this connection, we design a provable algorithm that can recover private vectors using only the public vectors and synthetic vectors generated by InstaHide, under the assumption that the private and public vectors are isotropic Gaussian",

    "abstract": "The capability of incrementally learning new tasks without forgetting old ones is a challenging problem due to catastrophic forgetting. This challenge becomes greater when novel tasks contain very few labelled training samples. Currently, most methods are dedicated to class-incremental learning and rely on sufficient training data to learn additional weights for newly added classes. Those methods cannot be easily extended to incremental regression tasks and could suffer from severe overfitting when learning few-shot novel tasks. In this study, we propose a nonparametric method in deep embedded space to tackle incremental few-shot learning problems. The knowledge about the learned tasks is compressed into a small number of quantized reference vectors. The proposed method learns new tasks sequentially by adding more reference vectors to the model using few-shot samples in each novel task. For classification problems, we employ the nearest neighbor scheme to make classification on sparsely available data and incorporate intra-class variation, less forgetting regularization and calibration of reference vectors to mitigate catastrophic forgetting. In addition, the proposed learning vector quantization (LVQ) in deep embedded space can be customized as a kernel smoother to handle incremental few-shot regression tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms other state-of-the-art methods in incremental learning",

    "title": "MONGOOSE: A Learnable LSH Framework for Efficient Neural Network Training",
    "abstract": "Recent advances by practitioners in the deep learning community have breathed new life into Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH), using it to reduce memory and time bottlenecks in neural network (NN) training. However, while LSH has sublinear guarantees for approximate near-neighbor search in theory, it is known to have inefficient query time in practice due to its use of random hash functions. Moreover, when model parameters are changing, LSH suffers from update overhead. This work is motivated by an observation that model parameters evolve slowly, such that the changes do not always require an LSH update to maintain performance. This phenomenon points to the potential for a reduction in update time and allows for a modified learnable version of data-dependent LSH to improve query time at a low cost. We use the above insights to build MONGOOSE, an end-to-end LSH framework for efficient NN training. In particular, MONGOOSE is equipped with a scheduling algorithm to adaptively perform LSH updates with provable guarantees and learnable hash functions to improve query efficiency. Empirically, we validate MONGOOSE on large-scale deep learning models for recommendation systems and language modeling. We find that it achieves up to 8% better accuracy compared to previous LSH approaches, with 6.5× speed-up and 6× reduction in memory usage",

For example, training an image classifier to regress audio labels rather than traditional categorical probabilities produces a more reliable classification. This result is surprising, considering that audio labels are more complex than simpler numerical probabilities or text. We hypothesize that high dimensional, high entropy label representations are generally more useful because they provide a stronger error signal. We support this hypothesis with evidence from various label representations including constant matrices, spectrograms, shuffled spectrograms, Gaussian mixtures, and uniform random matrices of various dimensionalities. Our experiments reveal that high dimensional, high entropy labels achieve comparable accuracy to text (categorical) labels on the standard image classification task, but features learned through our label representations exhibit more robustness under various adversarial attacks and better effectiveness with a limited amount of training data. These results suggest that label representation may play a more important role than previously thought",

Recent study has shown that a deep neural network can misclassify the data even if the input data is perturbed by an imperceptible amount.

Instead of modifying the parameters in a fixed neural network architecture, a close-loop control process is added to generate control signals adaptively for the perturbed or corrupted data. We connect the robustness of neural networks with optimal control using the geometrical information of underlying data to design the control objective. The detailed analysis shows how the embedding manifolds of state trajectory affect error estimation of the proposed method. Our approach can simultaneously maintain the performance on clean data and improve the robustness against many types of data perturbations. It can also further improve the performance of robustly trained neural networks against different perturbations.

This is a challenging problem; currently, state-of-the-art models often require dense supervision on physical object properties and events from simulation, which are impractical to obtain in real life. In this paper, we present the Dynamic Concept Learner (DCL), a unified framework that grounds physical objects and events from dynamic scenes and language. DCL first adopts a trajectory extractor to track each object over time and to represent it as a latent, object-centric feature vector. Building upon this object-centric representation, DCL learns to approximate the dynamic interaction among objects using graph networks. DCL further incorporates a semantic parser to parse question into semantic programs and, finally, a program executor to run the program to answer the question, levering the learned dynamics model. After training, DCL can detect and associate objects across the frames, ground visual properties and physical events, understand the causal relationship between events, make future and counterfactual predictions, and leverage these extracted presentations for answering queries. DCL achieves state-of-the-art performance on CLEVRER, a challenging causal video reasoning dataset, even without using ground-truth attributes and collision labels from simulations for training.

This intriguing problem of robust overfitting motivates us to seek more remedies. As a pilot study, this paper investigates two empirical means to inject more learned smoothening during AT: one leveraging knowledge distillation and self-training to smooth the logits, the other performing stochastic weight averaging (Izmailov et al., 2018) to smooth the weights. Despite the embarrassing simplicity, the two approaches are surprisingly effective and hassle-free in mitigating robust overfitting. Experiments demonstrate that by plugging in them to AT, we can simultaneously boost the standard accuracy by 3.72% ∼ 6.68% and robust accuracy by 0.22% ∼ 2.03%, across multiple datasets (STL-10, SVHN, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Tiny ImageNet), perturbation types (`∞ and `2), and robustified methods (PGD, TRADES, and FSGM), establishing the new state-of-the-art bar in AT.

However, the compression of GANs has less been explored. A few works show that heuristically applying compression techniques normally leads to unsatisfactory results, due to the notorious training instability of GANs. In parallel, the lottery ticket hypothesis shows prevailing success on discriminative models, in locating sparse matching subnetworks capable of training in isolation to full model performance. In this work, we for the first time study the existence of such trainable matching subnetworks in deep GANs. For a range of GANs, we certainly find matching subnetworks at 67%-74% sparsity. We observe that with or without pruning discriminator has a minor effect on the existence and quality of matching subnetworks, while the initialization weights used in the discriminator plays a significant role. We then show the powerful transferability of these subnetworks to unseen tasks. Furthermore, extensive experimental results demonstrate that our found subnetworks substantially outperform previous state-of-the-art GAN compression approaches in both image generation (e.g. SNGAN) and image-to-image translation GANs (e.g. CycleGAN).

    "abstract": "This paper introduces WaveGrad, a conditional model for waveform generation which estimates gradients of the data density. The model is built on prior work on score matching and diffusion probabilistic models. It starts from a Gaussian white noise signal and iteratively refines the signal via a gradient-based sampler conditioned on the mel-spectrogram. WaveGrad offers a natural way to trade inference speed for sample quality by adjusting the number of refinement steps, and bridges the gap between non-autoregressive and autoregressive models in terms of audio quality. We find that it can generate high fidelity audio samples using as few as six iterations. Experiments reveal WaveGrad to generate high fidelity audio, outperforming adversarial non-autoregressive baselines and matching a strong likelihood-based autoregressive baseline using fewer sequential operations.

    "title": "FairFil: Contrastive Neural Debiasing Method for Pretrained Text Encoders",
    "abstract": "Pretrained text encoders, such as BERT, have been applied increasingly in various natural language processing (NLP) tasks, and have recently demonstrated significant performance gains. However, recent studies have demonstrated the existence of social bias in these pretrained NLP models. Although prior works have made progress on word-level debiasing, improved sentence-level fairness of pretrained encoders still lacks exploration. In this paper, we proposed the first neural debiasing method for a pretrained sentence encoder, which transforms the pretrained encoder outputs into debiased representations via a fair filter (FairFil) network. To learn the FairFil, we introduce a contrastive learning framework that not only minimizes the correlation between filtered embeddings and bias words but also preserves rich semantic information of the original sentences. On real-world datasets, our FairFil effectively reduces the bias degree of pretrained text encoders, while continuously showing desirable performance on downstream tasks. Moreover, our post hoc method does not require any retraining of the text encoders, further enlarging FairFil's application space",

In this work, we present the first nearly-linear time algorithm for this problem with a dimension-independent error guarantee. Previous robust algorithms with comparable error guarantees are slower by at least a factor of (d/ǫ), where d is the number of variables in the Bayesian network and ǫ is the fraction of corrupted samples. Our algorithm and analysis are considerably simpler than those in previous work. 1 We achieve this by establishing a direct connection between robust learning of Bayesian networks and robust mean estimation.

    "title": "Graph Convolution with Low-rank Learnable Local Filters",
    "abstract": "Geometric variations like rotation, scaling, and viewpoint changes pose a significant challenge to visual understanding. One common solution is to directly model certain intrinsic structures, e.g., using landmarks. However, it then becomes non-trivial to build effective deep models, especially when the underlying non-Euclidean grid is irregular and coarse. Recent deep models using graph convolutions provide an appropriate framework to handle such non-Euclidean data, but many of them, particularly those based on global graph Laplacians, lack expressiveness to capture local features required for representation of signals lying on the non-Euclidean grid. The current paper introduces a new type of graph convolution with learnable low-rank local filters, which is provably more expressive than previous spectral graph convolution methods. The model also provides a unified framework for both spectral and spatial graph convolutions. To improve model robustness, regularization by local graph Laplacians is introduced. The representation stability against input graph data perturbation is theoretically proved, making use of the graph filter locality and the local graph regularization. Experiments on spherical mesh data, real-world facial expression recognition/skeleton-based action recognition data, and data with simulated graph noise show the empirical advantage of the proposed model",

    "title": "Learning with Instance-Dependent Label Noise: A Sample Sieve Approach",
    "abstract": "Human-annotated labels are often prone to noise, and the presence of such noise will degrade the performance of the resulting deep neural network (DNN) models. Much of the literature (with several recent exceptions) of learning with noisy labels focuses on the case when the label noise is independent from features. Practically, annotations errors tend to be instance-dependent and often depend on the difficulty levels of recognizing a certain task. Applying existing results from instance-independent settings would require a significant amount of estimation of noise rates. Therefore, learning with instance-dependent label noise remains a challenge. In this paper, we propose CORES^2 (COnfidence REgularized Sample Sieve), which progressively sieves out corrupted samples. The implementation of CORES^2 does not require specifying noise rates and yet we are able to provide theoretical guarantees of CORES^2 in filtering out the corrupted examples. This high-quality sample sieve allows us to treat clean examples and the corrupted ones separately in training a DNN solution, and such a separation is shown to be advantageous in the instance-dependent noise setting. We demonstrate the performance of CORES^2 on CIFAR10 and CIFAR100 datasets with synthetic instance-dependent label noise and Clothing1M with real-world human noise. As of independent interests, our sample sieve provides a generic machinery for anatomizing noisy datasets and provides a flexible interface for various robust training techniques to further improve the performance",

    "abstract": "Machine learning processes, e.g. ''learning in games'', can be viewed as non-linear dynamical systems. In general, such systems exhibit a wide spectrum of behaviors, ranging from stability/recurrence to the undesirable phenomena of chaos (or ''butterfly effect''). Chaos captures sensitivity of round-off errors and can severely affect predictability and reproducibility of ML systems, but AI/ML community's understanding of it remains rudimentary. It has a lot out there that await exploration. Recently, Cheung and Piliouras employed volume-expansion argument to show that Lyapunov chaos occurs in the cumulative payoff space, when some popular learning algorithms, including Multiplicative Weights Update (MWU), Follow-the-Regularized-Leader (FTRL) and Optimistic MWU (OMWU), are used in several subspaces of games, e.g. zero-sum, coordination or graphical constant-sum games. It is natural to ask: can these results generalize to much broader families of games? We take on a game decomposition approach and answer the question affirmatively. Among other results, we propose a notion of ''matrix domination'' and design a linear program, and use them to characterize bimatrix games where MWU is Lyapunov chaotic almost everywhere. Such family of games has positive Lebesgue measure in the bimatrix game space, indicating that chaos is a substantial issue of learning in games. For multi-player games, we present a local equivalence of volume change between general games and graphical games, which is used to perform volume and chaos analyses of MWU and OMWU in potential games",

    "abstract": "In many important graph data processing applications the acquired information includes both node features and observations of the graph topology. Graph neural networks (GNNs) are designed to exploit both sources of evidence but they do not optimally trade-off their utility and integrate them in a manner that is also universal. Here, universality refers to independence on homophily or heterophily graph assumptions. We address these issues by introducing a new Generalized PageRank (GPR) GNN architecture that adaptively learns the GPR weights so as to jointly optimize node feature and topological information extraction, regardless of the extent to which the node labels are homophilic or heterophilic. Learned GPR weights automatically adjust to the node label pattern, irrelevant on the type of initialization, and thereby guarantee excellent learning performance for label patterns that are usually hard to handle. Furthermore, they allow one to avoid feature over-smoothing, a process which renders feature information nondiscriminative, without requiring the network to be shallow. Our accompanying theoretical analysis of the GPR-GNN method is facilitated by novel synthetic benchmark datasets generated by the so-called contextual stochastic block model. We also compare the performance of our GNN architecture with that of several state-of-the-art GNNs on the problem of node-classification, using well-known benchmark homophilic and heterophilic datasets. The results demonstrate that GPR-GNN offers significant performance improvement compared to existing techniques on both synthetic and benchmark data",

    "title": "Mapping the Timescale Organization of Neural Language Models",
    "abstract": "In the human brain, sequences of language input are processed within a distributed and hierarchical architecture, in which higher stages of processing encode contextual information over longer timescales. In contrast, in recurrent neural networks which perform natural language processing, we know little about how the multiple timescales of contextual information are functionally organized. Therefore, we applied tools developed in neuroscience to map the \"processing timescales\" of individual units within a word-level LSTM language model. This timescale-mapping method assigned long timescales to units previously found to track long-range syntactic dependencies, and revealed a new cluster of previously unreported long-timescale units. Next, we explored the functional role of units by examining the relationship between their processing timescales and network connectivity. We identified two classes of long-timescale units: \"Controller\" units composed a densely interconnected subnetwork and strongly projected to the forget and input gates of the rest of the network, while \"Integrator\" units showed the longest timescales in the network, and expressed projection profiles closer to the mean projection profile. Ablating integrator and controller units affected model performance at different position of a sentence, suggesting distinctive functions of these two sets of units. Finally, we tested the generalization of these results to a character-level LSTM model. In summary, we demonstrated a model-free technique for mapping the timescale organization in neural network models, and we applied this method to reveal the timescale and functional organization of LSTM language models",

We begin by observing that VAEs can actually implement autoregressive models, and other, more efficient generative models, if made sufficiently deep.

We test if insufficient depth explains the performance gap by by scaling a VAE to greater stochastic depth than previously explored and evaluating it on CIFAR-10, ImageNet, and FFHQ. We find that, in comparison to the PixelCNN, these very deep VAEs achieve higher likelihoods, use fewer parameters, generate samples thousands of times faster, and are more easily applied to high-resolution images.

These methods are often not applicable to neural gradients, which have very different statistical properties. Distinguished from weights and activations, we find that the distribution of neural gradients is approximately lognormal. Considering this, we suggest two closed-form analytical methods to reduce the computational and memory burdens of neural gradients. The first method optimizes the floating-point format and scale of the gradients. The second method accurately sets sparsity thresholds for gradient pruning. Each method achieves state-of-the-art results on ImageNet. To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first to (1) quantize the gradients to 6-bit floating-point formats, or (2) achieve up to 85% gradient sparsity -- in each case without accuracy degradation.

In many contexts, such as healthcare and finance, separate parties may wish to collaborate and learn from each other's data but are prevented from doing so due to privacy regulations. Some regulations prevent explicit sharing of data between parties by joining datasets in a central location (confidentiality). Others also limit implicit sharing of data, e.g., through model predictions (privacy). There is currently no method that enables machine learning in such a setting, where both confidentiality and privacy need to be preserved, to prevent both explicit and implicit sharing of data. Federated learning only provides confidentiality, not privacy, since gradients shared still contain private information. Differentially private learning assumes unreasonably large datasets. Furthermore, both of these learning paradigms produce a central model whose architecture was previously agreed upon by all parties rather than enabling collaborative learning where each party learns and improves their own local model. We introduce Confidential and Private Collaborative (CaPC) learning, the first method provably achieving both confidentiality and privacy in a collaborative setting. We leverage secure multiparty computation (MPC), homomorphic encryption (HE), and other techniques in combination with privately aggregated teacher models. We demonstrate how CaPC allows participants to collaborate without having to explicitly join their training sets or train a central model.

This representational power is crucial to accurately compare softmax with other kernels for the first time on large-scale tasks, beyond the reach of regular Transformers, and investigate optimal attention-kernels. Performers are linear architectures fully compatible with regular Transformers and with strong theoretical guarantees: unbiased or nearly-unbiased estimation of the attention matrix, uniform convergence and low estimation variance.

    "abstract": "Despite the fast development of differentiable architecture search (DARTS), it suffers from a standing instability issue regarding searching performance, which extremely limits its application. Existing robustifying methods draw clues from the outcome instead of finding out the causing factor. Various indicators such as Hessian eigenvalues are proposed as a signal of performance collapse, and the searching should be stopped once an indicator reaches a preset threshold. However, these methods tend to easily reject good architectures if thresholds are inappropriately set, let alone the searching is intrinsically noisy. In this paper, we undertake a more subtle and direct approach to resolve the collapse. We first demonstrate that skip connections with a learnable architectural coefficient can easily recover from a disadvantageous state and become dominant. We conjecture that skip connections profit too much from this privilege, hence causing the collapse for the derived model. Therefore, we propose to factor out this benefit with an auxiliary skip connection, ensuring a fairer competition for all operations.

However, there are many important differences between ANN units and real neurons. One of the most notable is the absence of Dale's principle, which ensures that biological neurons are either exclusively excitatory or inhibitory. Dale's principle is typically left out of ANNs because its inclusion impairs learning. This is problematic, because one of the great advantages of ANNs for neuroscience research is their ability to learn complicated, realistic tasks. Here, by taking inspiration from feedforward inhibitory interneurons in the brain we show that we can develop ANNs with separate populations of excitatory and inhibitory units that learn just as well as standard ANNs. We call these networks Dale's ANNs (DANNs). We present two insights that enable DANNs to learn well: (1) DANNs are related to normalization schemes, and can be initialized such that the inhibition centres and standardizes the excitatory activity, (2) updates to inhibitory neuron parameters should be scaled using corrections based on the Fisher Information matrix. These results demonstrate how ANNs that respect Dale's principle can be built without sacrificing learning performance, which is important for future work using ANNs as models of the brain. The results also may have interesting implications for how inhibitory plasticity in the real brain operates",

    "title": "Control-Aware Representations for Model-based Reinforcement Learning",
    "abstract": "A major challenge in modern reinforcement learning (RL) is efficient control of dynamical systems from high-dimensional sensory observations. Learning controllable embedding (LCE) is a promising approach that addresses this challenge by embedding the observations into a lower-dimensional latent space, estimating the latent dynamics, and utilizing it to perform control in the latent space. Two important questions in this area are how to learn a representation that is amenable to the control problem at hand, and how to achieve an end-to-end framework for representation learning and control. In this paper, we take a few steps towards addressing these questions. We first formulate a LCE model to learn representations that are suitable to be used by a policy iteration style algorithm in the latent space. We call this model control-aware representation learning (CARL). We derive a loss function for CARL that has close connection to the prediction, consistency, and curvature (PCC) principle for representation learning. We derive three implementations of CARL. In the offline implementation, we replace the locally-linear control algorithm (e.g.,~iLQR) used by the existing LCE methods with a RL algorithm, namely model-based soft actor-critic, and show that it results in significant improvement. In online CARL, we interleave representation learning and control, and demonstrate further gain in performance. Finally, we propose value-guided CARL, a variation in which we optimize a weighted version of the CARL loss function, where the weights depend on the TD-error of the current policy. We evaluate the proposed algorithms by extensive experiments on benchmark tasks and compare them with several LCE baselines",

    "title": "Temporally-Extended ε-Greedy Exploration",
    "abstract": "Recent work on exploration in reinforcement learning (RL) has led to a series of increasingly complex solutions to the problem. This increase in complexity often comes at the expense of generality. Recent empirical studies suggest that, when applied to a broader set of domains, some sophisticated exploration methods are outperformed by simpler counterparts, such as -greedy. In this paper we propose an exploration algorithm that retains the simplicity of -greedy while reducing dithering. We build on a simple hypothesis: the main limitation of greedy exploration is its lack of temporal persistence, which limits its ability to escape local optima. We propose a temporally extended form of -greedy that simply repeats the sampled action for a random duration. It turns out that, for many duration distributions, this suffices to improve exploration on a large set of domains. Interestingly, a class of distributions inspired by ecological models of animal foraging behaviour yields particularly strong performance",

In the present work, we propose a new IL method based on a conceptually simple algorithm: Primal Wasserstein Imitation Learning (PWIL), which ties to the primal form of the Wasserstein distance between the expert and the agent state-action distributions. We present a reward function which is derived offline, as opposed to recent adversarial IL algorithms that learn a reward function through interactions with the environment, and which requires little fine-tuning. We show that we can recover expert behavior on a variety of continuous control tasks of the MuJoCo domain in a sample efficient manner in terms of agent interactions and of expert interactions with the environment. Finally, we show that the behavior of the agent we train matches the behavior of the expert with the Wasserstein distance, rather than the commonly used proxy of performance",

    "title": "Adapting to Reward Progressivity via Spectral Reinforcement Learning",
    "abstract": "In this paper we consider reinforcement learning tasks with progressive rewards; that is, tasks where the rewards tend to increase in magnitude over time. We hypothesise that this property may be problematic for value-based deep reinforcement learning agents, particularly if the agent must first succeed in relatively unrewarding regions of the task in order to reach more rewarding regions. To address this issue, we propose Spectral DQN, which decomposes the reward into frequencies such that the high frequencies only activate when large rewards are found. This allows the training loss to be balanced so that it gives more even weighting across small and large reward regions. In two domains with extreme reward progressivity, where standard value-based methods struggle significantly, Spectral DQN is able to make much farther progress. Moreover, when evaluated on a set of six standard Atari games that do not overtly favour the approach, Spectral DQN remains more than competitive: While it underperforms one of the benchmarks in a single game, it comfortably surpasses the benchmarks in three games. These results demonstrate that the approach is not overfit to its target problem, and suggest that Spectral DQN may have advantages beyond addressing reward progressivity",

    "abstract": "A popular approach to model compression is to train an inexpensive student model to mimic the class probabilities of a highly accurate but cumbersome teacher model. Surprisingly, this two-step knowledge distillation process often leads to higher accuracy than training the student directly on labeled data. To explain and enhance this phenomenon, we cast knowledge distillation as a semiparametric inference problem with the optimal student model as the target, the unknown Bayes class probabilities as nuisance, and the teacher probabilities as a plug-in nuisance estimate. By adapting modern semiparametric tools, we derive new guarantees for the prediction error of standard distillation and develop two enhancements—cross-fitting and loss correction—to mitigate the impact of teacher overfitting and underfitting on student performance. We validate our findings empirically on both tabular and image data and observe consistent improvements from our knowledge distillation enhancements",

    "title": "Learning Parametrised Graph Shift Operators",
    "abstract": "In many domains data is currently represented as graphs and therefore, the graph representation of this data becomes increasingly important in machine learning. Network data is, implicitly or explicitly, always represented using a graph shift operator (GSO) with the most common choices being the adjacency, Laplacian matrices and their normalisations. In this paper, a novel parametrised GSO (PGSO) is proposed, where specific parameter values result in the most commonly used GSOs and message-passing operators in graph neural network (GNN) frameworks. The PGSO is suggested as a replacement of the standard GSOs that are used in state-of-the-art GNN architectures and the optimisation of the PGSO parameters is seamlessly included in the model training. It is proved that the PGSO has real eigenvalues and a set of real eigenvectors independent of the parameter values and spectral bounds on the PGSO are derived. PGSO parameters are shown to adapt to the sparsity of the graph structure in a study on stochastic blockmodel networks, where they are found to automatically replicate the GSO regularisation found in the literature. On several real-world datasets the accuracy of state-of-theart GNN architectures is improved by the inclusion of the PGSO in both nodeand graph-classification tasks",

    "title": "New Bounds For Distributed Mean Estimation and Variance Reduction",
    "abstract": "We consider the problem of distributed mean estimation (DME), in which n machines are each given a local d-dimensional vector xv ∈ R, and must cooperate to estimate the mean of their inputs μ = 1 n ∑n v=1 xv, while minimizing total communication cost. DME is a fundamental construct in distributed machine learning, and there has been considerable work on variants of this problem, especially in the context of distributed variance reduction for stochastic gradients in parallel SGD. Previous work typically assumes an upper bound on the norm of the input vectors, and achieves an error bound in terms of this norm. However, in many real applications, the input vectors are concentrated around the correct output μ, but μ itself has large norm. In such cases, previous output error bounds perform poorly. In this paper, we show that output error bounds need not depend on input norm. We provide a method of quantization which allows distributed mean estimation to be performed with solution quality dependent only on the distance between inputs, not on input norm, and show an analogous result for distributed variance reduction. The technique is based on a new connection with lattice theory. We also provide lower bounds showing that the communication to error trade-off of our algorithms is asymptotically optimal. As the lattices achieving optimal bounds under `2-norm can be computationally impractical, we also present an extension which leverages easy-to-use cubic lattices, and is loose only up to a logarithmic factor in d. We show experimentally that our method yields practical improvements for common applications, relative to prior approaches",

    "title": "Optimal Conversion of Conventional Artificial Neural Networks to Spiking Neural Networks",
    "abstract": "Spiking neural networks (SNNs) are biology-inspired artificial neural networks (ANNs) that comprise of spiking neurons to process asynchronous discrete signals. While more efficient in power consumption and inference speed on the neuromorphic hardware, SNNs are usually difficult to train directly from scratch with spikes due to the discreteness. As an alternative, many efforts have been devoted to converting conventional ANNs into SNNs by copying the weights from ANNs and adjusting the spiking threshold potential of neurons in SNNs. Researchers have designed new SNN architectures and conversion algorithms to diminish the conversion error. However, an effective conversion should address the difference between the SNN and ANN architectures with an efficient approximation of the loss function, which is missing in the field. In this work, we analyze the conversion error by recursive reduction to layer-wise summation and propose a novel strategic pipeline that transfers the weights to the target SNN by combining threshold balance and soft-reset mechanisms. This pipeline enables almost no accuracy loss between the converted SNNs and conventional ANNs with only ∼ 1/10 of the typical SNN simulation time. Our method is promising to get implanted onto embedded platforms with better support of SNNs with limited energy and memory.

    "abstract": "Human perception excels at building compositional hierarchies of parts and objects from unlabeled scenes that help systematic generalization. Yet most work on generative scene modeling either ignores the part-whole relationship or assumes access to predefined part labels. In this paper, we propose Generative Scene Graph Networks (GSGNs), the first deep generative model that learns to discover the primitive parts and infer the part-whole relationship jointly from multi-object scenes without supervision and in an end-to-end trainable way. We formulate GSGN as a variational autoencoder in which the latent representation is a treestructured probabilistic scene graph. The leaf nodes in the latent tree correspond to primitive parts, and the edges represent the symbolic pose variables required for recursively composing the parts into whole objects and then the full scene. This allows novel objects and scenes to be generated both by sampling from the prior and by manual configuration of the pose variables, as we do with graphics engines. We evaluate GSGN on datasets of scenes containing multiple compositional objects, including a challenging Compositional CLEVR dataset that we have developed. We show that GSGN is able to infer the latent scene graph, generalize out of the training regime, and improve data efficiency in downstream tasks",

    "abstract": "The standard Markov Decision Process (MDP) formulation hinges on the assumption that an action is executed immediately after it was chosen. However, assuming it is often unrealistic and can lead to catastrophic failures in applications such as robotic manipulation, cloud computing, and finance. We introduce a framework for learning and planning in MDPs where the decision-maker commits actions that are executed with a delay of m steps. The brute-force state augmentation baseline where the state is concatenated to the last m committed actions suffers from an exponential complexity in m, as we show for policy iteration. We then prove that with execution delay, Markov policies in the original state-space are sufficient for attaining maximal reward, but need to be non-stationary. As for stationary Markov policies, we show they are sub-optimal in general. Consequently, we devise a non-stationary Q-learning style model-based algorithm that solves delayed execution tasks without resorting to state-augmentation. Experiments on tabular, physical, and Atari domains reveal that it converges quickly to high performance even for substantial delays, while standard approaches that either ignore the delay or rely on state-augmentation struggle or fail due to divergence.

In this case, careful consideration is needed to select tasks and model parameterizations such that updates from the auxiliary tasks actually help the primary task. We seek to alleviate this burden by formulating a modelagnostic framework that performs fine-grained manipulation of the auxiliary task gradients. We propose to decompose auxiliary updates into directions which help, damage or leave the primary task loss unchanged. This allows weighting the update directions differently depending on their impact on the problem of interest. We present a novel and efficient algorithm for that purpose and show its advantage in practice. Our method leverages efficient automatic differentiation procedures and randomized singular value decomposition for scalability.

    "abstract": "Recently, Frankle & Carbin (2019) demonstrated that randomly-initialized dense networks contain subnetworks that once found can be trained to reach test accuracy comparable to the trained dense network. However, finding these high performing trainable subnetworks is expensive, requiring iterative process of training and pruning weights. In this paper, we propose (and prove) a stronger Multi-Prize Lottery Ticket Hypothesis: A sufficiently over-parameterized neural network with random weights contains several subnetworks (winning tickets) that (a) have comparable accuracy to a dense target network with learned weights (prize 1), (b) do not require any further training to achieve prize 1 (prize 2), and (c) is robust to extreme forms of quantization (i.e., binary weights and/or activation) (prize 3). This provides a new paradigm for learning compact yet highly accurate binary neural networks simply by pruning and quantizing randomly weighted full precision neural networks. We also propose an algorithm for finding multi-prize tickets (MPTs) and test it by performing a series of experiments on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet datasets. Empirical results indicate that as models grow deeper and wider, multi-prize tickets start to reach similar (and sometimes even higher) test accuracy compared to their significantly larger and full-precision counterparts that have been weight-trained. Without ever updating the weight values, our MPTs-1/32 not only set new binary weight network state-of-the-art (SOTA) Top-1 accuracy – 94.8% on CIFAR-10 and 74.03% on ImageNet – but also outperform their full-precision counterparts by 1.78% and 0.76%, respectively.

In this study, we empirically show that as a side effect of this training, the lexical choice errors on low-frequency words are propagated to the NAT model from the teacher model. To alleviate this problem, we propose to expose the raw data to NAT models to restore the useful information of low-frequency words, which are missed in the distilled data. To this end, we introduce an extra Kullback-Leibler divergence term derived by comparing the lexical choice of NAT model and that embedded in the raw data. Experimental results across language pairs and model architectures demonstrate the effectiveness and universality of the proposed approach. Extensive analyses confirm our claim that our approach improves performance by reducing the lexical choice errors on low-frequency words.

This paper aims to learn predictive, interpretable, and robust relation representations from distantly-labeled data that are effective in different settings, including supervised, distantly supervised, and few-shot learning. Instead of solely relying on the supervision from noisy labels, we propose to learn prototypes for each relation from contextual information to best explore the intrinsic semantics of relations. Prototypes are representations in the feature space abstracting the essential semantics of relations between entities in sentences. We learn prototypes based on objectives with clear geometric interpretation, where the prototypes are unit vectors uniformly dispersed in a unit ball, and statement embeddings are centered at the end of their corresponding prototype vectors on the surface of the ball. This approach allows us to learn meaningful, interpretable prototypes for the final classification. Results on several relation learning tasks show that our model significantly outperforms the previous state-of-the-art models.

    "abstract": "This work proposes the continuous conditional generative adversarial network (CcGAN), the first generative model for image generation conditional on continuous, scalar conditions (termed regression labels). Existing conditional GANs (cGANs) are mainly designed for categorical conditions (e.g., class labels); conditioning on regression labels is mathematically distinct and raises two fundamental problems: (P1) Since there may be very few (even zero) real images for some regression labels, minimizing existing empirical versions of cGAN losses (a.k.a. empirical cGAN losses) often fails in practice; (P2) Since regression labels are scalar and infinitely many, conventional label input methods are not applicable. The proposed CcGAN solves the above problems, respectively, by (S1) reformulating existing empirical cGAN losses to be appropriate for the continuous scenario; and (S2) proposing a naive label input (NLI) method and an improved label input (ILI) method to incorporate regression labels into the generator and the discriminator. The reformulation in (S1) leads to two novel empirical discriminator losses, termed the hard vicinal discriminator loss (HVDL) and the soft vicinal discriminator loss (SVDL) respectively, and a novel empirical generator loss. The error bounds of a discriminator trained with HVDL and SVDL are derived under mild assumptions in this work. Two new benchmark datasets (RC-49 and Cell-200) and a novel evaluation metric (Sliding Frechet Inception Distance) are also proposed for this continuous scenario. Our experiments on the Circular 2-D Gaussians, RC-49, UTKFace, Cell-200, and Steering Angle datasets show that CcGAN can generate diverse, high-quality samples from the image distribution conditional on a given regression label. Moreover, in these experiments, CcGAN substantially outperforms cGAN both visually and quantitatively",

In this work we take a first step towards closing this gap by developing average-case optimal first-order methods for a subset of smooth games. We make the following three main contributions. First, we show that for zero-sum bilinear games the average-case optimal method is the optimal method for the minimization of the Hamiltonian. Second, we provide an explicit expression for the optimal method corresponding to normal matrices, potentially non-symmetric.

    "abstract": "Modern text-to-speech synthesis pipelines typically involve multiple processing stages, each of which is designed or learnt independently from the rest. In this work, we take on the challenging task of learning to synthesise speech from normalised text or phonemes in an end-to-end manner, resulting in models which operate directly on character or phoneme input sequences and produce raw speech audio outputs. Our proposed generator is feed-forward and thus efficient for both training and inference, using a differentiable alignment scheme based on token length prediction. It learns to produce high fidelity audio through a combination of adversarial feedback and prediction losses constraining the generated audio to roughly match the ground truth in terms of its total duration and mel-spectrogram. To allow the model to capture temporal variation in the generated audio, we employ soft dynamic time warping in the spectrogram-based prediction loss. The resulting model achieves a mean opinion score exceeding 4 on a 5 point scale, which is comparable to the state-of-the-art models relying on multi-stage training and additional supervision",

    "title": "Towards Robustness Against Natural Language Word Substitutions",
    "abstract": "Robustness against word substitutions has a well-defined and widely acceptable form, i.e., using semantically similar words as substitutions, and thus it is considered as a fundamental stepping-stone towards broader robustness in natural language processing. Previous defense methods capture word substitutions in vector space by using either l2-ball or hyper-rectangle, which results in perturbation sets that are not inclusive enough or unnecessarily large, and thus impedes mimicry of worst cases for robust training. In this paper, we introduce a novel Adversarial Sparse Convex Combination (ASCC) method. We model the word substitution attack space as a convex hull and leverages a regularization term to enforce perturbation towards an actual substitution, thus aligning our modeling better with the discrete textual space. Based on the ASCC method, we further propose ASCC-defense, which leverages ASCC to generate worst-case perturbations and incorporates adversarial training towards robustness. Experiments show that ASCC-defense outperforms the current state-of-the-arts in terms of robustness on two prevailing NLP tasks, i.e., sentiment analysis and natural language inference, concerning several attacks across multiple model architectures. Besides, we also envision a new class of defense towards robustness in NLP, where our robustly trained word vectors can be plugged into a normally trained model and enforce its robustness without applying any other defense techniques. 1",

    "abstract": "When designing controllers for safety-critical systems, practitioners often face a challenging tradeoff between robustness and performance. While robust control methods provide rigorous guarantees on system stability under certain worst-case disturbances, they often result in simple controllers that perform poorly in the average (non-worst) case. In contrast, nonlinear control methods trained using deep learning have achieved state-of-the-art performance on many control tasks, but often lack robustness guarantees. We propose a technique that combines the strengths of these two approaches: a generic nonlinear control policy class, parameterized by neural networks, that nonetheless enforces the same provable robustness criteria as robust control. Specifically, we show that by integrating custom convex-optimization-based projection layers into a nonlinear policy, we can construct a provably robust neural network policy class that outperforms robust control methods in the average (non-adversarial) setting. We demonstrate the power of this approach on several domains, improving in performance over existing robust control methods and in stability over (non-robust) RL methods",

Specifically, we focus on the setting where there exists a good \\emph{common representation} between source and target, and our goal is to understand how much of a sample size reduction is possible.

It is of pivotal importance to design effective visual representations of the observed scene in determining navigation actions. In this paper, we introduce a Visual Transformer Network (VTNet) for learning informative visual representation in navigation. VTNet is a highly effective structure that embodies two key properties for visual representations: First, the relationships among all the object instances in a scene are exploited; Second, the spatial locations of objects and image regions are emphasized so that directional navigation signals can be learned. Furthermore, we also develop a pre-training scheme to associate the visual representations with navigation signals, and thus facilitate navigation policy learning. In a nutshell, VTNet embeds object and region features with their location cues as spatial-aware descriptors and then incorporates all the encoded descriptors through attention operations to achieve informative representation for navigation. Given such visual representations, agents are able to explore the correlations between visual observations and navigation actions. For example, an agent would prioritize ``turning right'' over ``turning left'' when the visual representation emphasizes on the right side of activation map. Experiments in the artificial environment AI2-Thor demonstrate that VTNet significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in unseen testing environments",

One algorithm that achieves this goal is the sequential probability ratio test (SPRT), which is known as Bayes-optimal: it can keep the expected number of data samples as small as possible, given the desired error upper-bound. However, the original SPRT makes two critical assumptions that limit its application in real-world scenarios: (i) samples are independently and identically distributed, and (ii) the likelihood of the data being derived from each class can be calculated precisely. Here, we propose the SPRT-TANDEM, a deep neural network-based SPRT algorithm that overcomes the above two obstacles. The SPRT-TANDEM sequentially estimates the log-likelihood ratio of two alternative hypotheses by leveraging a novel Loss function for Log-Likelihood Ratio estimation (LLLR) while allowing correlations up to N (∈ N) preceding samples. In tests on one original and two public video databases, Nosaic MNIST, UCF101, and SiW, the SPRT-TANDEM achieves statistically significantly better classification accuracy than other baseline classifiers, with a smaller number of data samples.

    "abstract": "The goal of continual learning (CL) is to learn a sequence of tasks  without suffering from the phenomenon of catastrophic forgetting.  Previous work has shown that leveraging memory in the form of a replay  buffer can reduce performance degradation on prior tasks. We hypothesize  that forgetting can be further reduced when the model is encouraged to  remember the evidence for previously made decisions. As a first  step towards exploring this hypothesis, we propose a simple novel  training paradigm, called Remembering for the Right Reasons (RRR), that  additionally stores visual model explanations for each example in the  buffer and ensures the model has \"the right reasons\" for its  predictions by encouraging its explanations to remain consistent with  those used to make decisions at training time. Without this constraint,  there is a drift in explanations and increase in forgetting as  conventional continual learning algorithms learn new tasks. We  demonstrate how RRR can be easily added to any memory or  regularization-based approach and results in reduced forgetting, and  more importantly, improved model explanations. We have evaluated our  approach in the standard and few-shot settings and observed a consistent  improvement across various CL approaches using different architectures  and techniques to generate model explanations and demonstrated our  approach showing a promising connection between explainability and  continual learning.

Unfortunately, this bound is known to be tight, limiting further improvements to the complexity of this problem. In this paper we consider estimation algorithms augmented with a machine-learning-based predictor that, given any element, returns an estimation of its frequency.

In contrast to feedforward networks, RNNs iteratively reuse a shared set of weights and require working memory to process input samples. We show that the performance of weight-importance methods is not directly affected by the length of the processed sequences, but rather by high working memory requirements, which lead to an increased need for stability at the cost of decreased plasticity for learning subsequent tasks. We additionally provide theoretical arguments supporting this interpretation by studying linear RNNs. Our study shows that established CL methods can be successfully ported to the recurrent case, and that a recent regularization approach based on hypernetworks outperforms weight-importance methods, thus emerging as a promising candidate for CL in RNNs.

This modified reward function is simple to estimate by learning auxiliary classifiers that distinguish source-domain transitions from target-domain transitions. Intuitively, the modified reward function penalizes the agent for visiting states and taking actions in the source domain which are not possible in the target domain. Said another way, the agent is penalized for transitions that would indicate that the agent is interacting with the source domain, rather than the target domain. Our approach is applicable to domains with continuous states and actions and does not require learning an explicit model of the dynamics.

Via Bayes' rule, predictions from our classifier can be transformed into predictions over future states. Importantly, an off-policy variant of our algorithm allows us to predict the future state distribution of a new policy, without collecting new experience. This variant allows us to optimize functionals of a policy's future state distribution, such as the density of reaching a particular goal state.

In this paper, we propose contextual dropout with an efficient structural design as a simple and scalable sample-dependent dropout module, which can be applied to a wide range of models at the expense of only slightly increased memory and computational cost. We learn the dropout probabilities with a variational objective, compatible with both Bernoulli dropout and Gaussian dropout. We apply the contextual dropout module to various models with applications to image classification and visual question answering and demonstrate the scalability of the method with large-scale datasets, such as ImageNet and VQA 2.0. Our experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms baseline methods in terms of both accuracy and quality of uncertainty estimation",

    "abstract": "This paper studies the behaviour of the stochastic subgradient descent (SSGD) method applied to over-parameterized nonsmooth optimization problems that satisfy an interpolation condition. By leveraging the composite structure of the empirical risk minimization problems, we prove that SSGD converges, respectively, with rates O (1 /(cid:15) ) and O (log(1 /(cid:15) )) for convex and strongly-convex objectives when interpolation holds. These rates coincide with established rates for the stochastic gradient descent (SGD) method applied to smooth problems that also satisfy an interpolation condition. Our analysis provides a partial explanation for the empirical observation that sometimes SGD and SSGD behave similarly for training smooth and nonsmooth machine learning models. We also prove that the rate O (1 /(cid:15) ) is optimal for the subgradient method in the convex and interpolation setting",

The problem is motivated by our empirical studies that while the widely used contrastive self-supervised learning method has shown great progress on large model training, it does not work well for small models. To address this problem, we propose a new learning paradigm, named SElf-SupErvised Distillation (SEED), where we leverage a larger network (as Teacher) to transfer its representational knowledge into a smaller architecture (as Student) in a self-supervised fashion. Instead of directly learning from unlabeled data, we train a student encoder to mimic the similarity score distribution inferred by a teacher over a set of instances. We show that SEED dramatically boosts the performance of small networks on downstream tasks. Compared with self-supervised baselines, SEED improves the top-1 accuracy from 42.2% to 67.6% on EfficientNet-B0 and from 36.3% to 68.2% on MobileNet-v3-Large on the ImageNet-1k dataset",

At the heart of our approach, a task generator learns to create tasks via a black-box procedural generation module by adaptively sampling from the parameterized task space. To enable curriculum learning in the absence of a direct indicator of learning progress, the task generator is trained by balancing the agent's expected return in the generated tasks and their similarities to the target task. Through adversarial training, the similarity between the generated tasks and the target task is adaptively estimated by a task discriminator defined on the agent's behaviors. In this way, our approach can efficiently generate tasks of rich variations for target tasks of unknown parameterization or not covered by the predefined task space.

Through this, our work not only provides a useful mechanism that can improve the active learning approach, but also an explanation of the empirical successes of various existing approaches which ignore this bias.

Key to these recent successes has been the use of new elements such as sinusoidal nonlinearities or Fourier features in positional encodings, which vastly outperform simple ReLU networks. In this paper, we propose and empirically demonstrate that an arguably simpler class of function approximators can work just as well for such problems: multiplicative filter networks. In these networks, we avoid traditional compositional depth altogether, and simply multiply together (linear functions of) sinusoidal or Gabor wavelet functions applied to the input. This representation has the notable advantage that the entire function can simply be viewed as a linear function approximator over an exponential number of Fourier or Gabor basis functions, respectively. Despite this simplicity, when compared to recent approaches that use Fourier features with ReLU networks or sinusoidal activation networks, we show that these multiplicative filter networks largely outperform or match the performance of these approaches on the domains highlighted in these past works",

    "abstract": "A hallmark of human intelligence is the ability to interact directly with raw data and acquire rich, general-purpose conceptual representations. In machine learning, symbolic models can capture the compositional and causal knowledge that enables flexible generalization, but they struggle to learn from raw inputs, relying on strong abstractions and simplifying assumptions. Neural network models can learn directly from raw data, but they struggle to capture compositional and causal structure and typically must retrain to tackle new tasks. To help bridge this gap, we propose Generative Neuro-Symbolic (GNS) Modeling, a framework for learning task-general representations by combining the structure of symbolic models with the expressivity of neural networks. Concepts and conceptual background knowledge are represented as probabilistic programs with neural network sub-routines, maintaining explicit causal and compositional structure while capturing nonparametric relationships and learning directly from raw data. We apply GNS to the Omniglot challenge of learning simple visual concepts at a human level. We report competitive results on 4 unique tasks including one-shot classification, parsing, generating new exemplars, and generating new concepts. To our knowledge, this is the strongest neurally-grounded model to complete a diverse set of Omniglot tasks",

    "abstract": "Off-policy evaluation (OPE) is the task of estimating the expected reward of a given policy based on offline data previously collected under different policies. Therefore, OPE is a key step in applying reinforcement learning to real-world domains such as medical treatment, where interactive data collection is expensive or even unsafe. As the observed data tends to be noisy and limited, it is essential to provide rigorous uncertainty quantification, not just a point estimation, when applying OPE to make high stakes decisions. This work considers the problem of constructing non-asymptotic confidence intervals in infinite-horizon off-policy evaluation, which remains a challenging open question. We develop a practical algorithm through a primal-dual optimization-based approach, which leverages the kernel Bellman loss (KBL) of Feng et al. (2019) and a new martingale concentration inequality of KBL applicable to timedependent data with unknown mixing conditions. Our algorithm makes minimum assumptions on the data and the function class of the Q-function, and works for the behavior-agnostic settings where the data is collected under a mix of arbitrary unknown behavior policies.

This high temperature \"quantum computing toy model\" is nevertheless interesting to study as it allows rather accessible explanations of key concepts in quantum computing, in particular interference, entanglement, and the measurement process.   We specifically study the problem of classifying an example from the MNIST and Fashion-MNIST datasets, subject to the constraint that we have to make a prediction after the detection of the very first photon that passed a coherently illuminated filter showing the example. Whereas a classical set-up in which a photon is detected after falling on one of the~$28\\times 28$ image pixels is limited to a (maximum likelihood estimation) accuracy of~$21.27\\%$ for MNIST, respectively $18.27\\%$ for Fashion-MNIST, we show that the theoretically achievable accuracy when exploiting inference by optically transforming the quantum state of the photon is at least $41.27\\%$ for MNIST, respectively $36.14\\%$ for Fashion-MNIST.

These methods consider a policy (the actor) and a value function (the critic) whose respective losses are built using different motivations and approaches. This paper introduces a third protagonist: the adversary. While the adversary mimics the actor by minimizing the KL-divergence between their respective action distributions, the actor, in addition to learning to solve the task, tries to differentiate itself from the adversary predictions. This novel objective stimulates the actor to follow strategies that could not have been correctly predicted from previous trajectories, making its behavior innovative in tasks where the reward is extremely rare. Our experimental analysis shows that the resulting Adversarially Guided Actor-Critic (AGAC) algorithm leads to more exhaustive exploration. Notably, AGAC outperforms current state-of-the-art methods on a set of various hard-exploration and procedurally-generated tasks",

Motivated by the connection between geometry of the loss landscape and generalization---including a generalization bound that we prove here---we introduce a novel, effective procedure for instead simultaneously minimizing loss value and loss sharpness. In particular, our procedure, Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM), seeks parameters that lie in neighborhoods having uniformly low loss; this formulation results in a min-max optimization problem on which gradient descent can be performed efficiently. We present empirical results showing that SAM improves model generalization across a variety of benchmark datasets (e.g., CIFAR-{10, 100}, ImageNet, finetuning tasks) and models, yielding novel state-of-the-art performance for several. Additionally, we find that SAM natively provides robustness to label noise on par with that provided by state-of-the-art procedures that specifically target learning with noisy labels",

We show that representations trained with this objective perform better on downstream tasks and are more robust to the introduction of nuisance transformations at test time. Second, we propose a change to how test time representations are generated by introducing a feature averaging approach that combines encodings from multiple transformations of the original input, finding that this leads to across the board performance gains. Finally, we introduce the novel Spirograph dataset to explore our ideas in the context of a differentiable generative process with multiple downstream tasks, showing that our techniques for learning invariance are highly beneficial",

This sensitivity can partly be attributed to the non-stationarity of the RL problem, potentially requiring different hyperparameter settings at various stages of the learning process. Additionally, in the RL setting, hyperparameter optimization (HPO) requires a large number of environment interactions, hindering the transfer of the successes in RL to real-world applications. In this work, we tackle the issues of sample-efficient and dynamic HPO in RL. We propose a population-based automated RL (AutoRL) framework to meta-optimize arbitrary off-policy RL algorithms. In this framework, we optimize the hyperparameters and also the neural architecture while simultaneously training the agent. By sharing the collected experience across the population, we substantially increase the sample efficiency of the meta-optimization. We demonstrate the capabilities of our sample-efficient AutoRL approach in a case study with the popular TD3 algorithm in the MuJoCo benchmark suite, where we reduce the number of environment interactions needed for meta-optimization by up to an order of magnitude compared to population-based training",

Although these methods surpass the trivial baseline of random pruning, they remain below the accuracy of magnitude pruning after training, and we endeavor to understand why. We show that, unlike pruning after training, accuracy is the same or higher when randomly shuffling which weights these methods prune within each layer or sampling new initial values. As such, the per-weight pruning decisions made by these methods can be replaced by a per-layer choice of the fraction of weights to prune. This property undermines the claimed justifications for these methods and suggests broader challenges with the underlying pruning heuristics, the desire to prune at initialization, or both",

To study this question, we investigate the performance achieved when training only these parameters and freezing all others at their random initializations. We find that doing so leads to surprisingly high performance. For example, sufficiently deep ResNets reach 82% (CIFAR-10) and 32% (ImageNet, top-5) accuracy in this configuration, far higher than when training an equivalent number of randomly chosen parameters from elsewhere in the network. BatchNorm achieves this performance in part by naturally learning to disable around a third of the random features.

Crucially, we show how these regions can be analyzed using geometric projections instead of expensive constraint solving, thus admitting an efficient, highly-parallel GPU implementation at the price of incompleteness, which can be addressed by falling back on prior approaches. Empirically, we find that incompleteness is not often an issue, and that our method performs one to two orders of magnitude faster than existing robustness-certification techniques based on constraint solving",

The ability to perform evaluation offline is particularly important in many real-world domains, such as healthcare, recommender systems, or robotics, where online data collection is an expensive and potentially dangerous process. Being able to accurately evaluate and select high-performing policies without requiring online interaction could yield significant benefits in safety, time, and cost for these applications. While many OPE methods have been proposed in recent years, comparing results between works is difficult because there is currently a lack of a comprehensive and unified benchmark. Moreover, it is difficult to measure how far algorithms have progressed, due to the lack of challenging evaluation tasks. In order to address this gap, we propose a new benchmark for off-policy evaluation which includes tasks on a range of challenging, high-dimensional control problems, with wide selections of datasets and policies for performing policy selection. The goal of of our benchmark is to provide a standardized measure of progress that is motivated from a set of principles designed to challenge and test the limits of existing OPE methods.

Specifically, we propose Cyclic Precision Training (CPT) to cyclically vary the precision between two boundary values which can be identified using a simple precision range test within the first few training epochs. Extensive simulations and ablation studies on five datasets and eleven models demonstrate that CPT's effectiveness is consistent across various models/tasks (including classification and language modeling). Furthermore, through experiments and visualization we show that CPT helps to (1) converge to a wider minima with a lower generalization error and (2) reduce training variance which we believe opens up a new design knob for simultaneously improving the optimization and efficiency of DNN training.

We propose to tackle this problem by leveraging the normalized maximum-likelihood (NML) estimator, which provides a principled approach to handling uncertainty and out-of-distribution inputs.

    "title": "Single-Timescale Actor-Critic Provably Finds Globally Optimal Policy",
    "abstract": "We study the global convergence and global optimality of actor-critic, one of the most popular families of reinforcement learning algorithms. While most existing works on actor-critic employ bi-level or two-timescale updates, we focus on the more practical single-timescale setting, where the actor and critic are updated simultaneously. Specifically, in each iteration, the critic update is obtained by applying the Bellman evaluation operator only once while the actor is updated in the policy gradient direction computed using the critic. Moreover, we consider two function approximation settings where both the actor and critic are represented by linear or deep neural networks. For both cases, we prove that the actor sequence converges to a globally optimal policy at a sublinear $O(K^{-1/2})$ rate, where $K$ is the number of iterations. To the best of our knowledge, we establish the rate of convergence and global optimality of single-timescale actor-critic with linear function approximation for the first time. Moreover, under the broader scope of policy optimization with nonlinear function approximation, we prove that actor-critic with deep neural network finds the globally optimal policy at a sublinear rate for the first time",

    "title": "X2T: Training an X-to-Text Typing Interface with Online Learning from User Feedback",
    "abstract": "We aim to help users communicate their intent to machines using flexible, adaptive interfaces that translate arbitrary user input into desired actions. In this work, we focus on assistive typing applications in which a user cannot operate a keyboard, but can instead supply other inputs, such as webcam images that capture eye gaze or neural activity measured by a brain implant. Standard methods train a model on a fixed dataset of user inputs, then deploy a static interface that does not learn from its mistakes; in part, because extracting an error signal from user behavior can be challenging. We investigate a simple idea that would enable such interfaces to improve over time, with minimal additional effort from the user: online learning from user feedback on the accuracy of the interface's actions. In the typing domain, we leverage backspaces as feedback that the interface did not perform the desired action. We propose an algorithm called x-to-text (X2T) that trains a predictive model of this feedback signal, and uses this model to fine-tune any existing, default interface for translating user input into actions that select words or characters. We evaluate X2T through a small-scale online user study with 12 participants who type sentences by gazing at their desired words, a large-scale observational study on handwriting samples from 60 users, and a pilot study with one participant using an electrocorticography-based brain-computer interface. The results show that X2T learns to outperform a non-adaptive default interface, stimulates user co-adaptation to the interface, personalizes the interface to individual users, and can leverage offline data collected from the default interface to improve its initial performance and accelerate online learning",

    "title": "Learning Energy-Based Models by Diffusion Recovery Likelihood",
    "abstract": "While energy-based models (EBMs) exhibit a number of desirable properties, training and sampling on high-dimensional datasets remains challenging. Inspired by recent progress on diffusion probabilistic models, we present a diffusion recovery likelihood method to tractably learn and sample from a sequence of EBMs trained on increasingly noisy versions of a dataset. Each EBM is trained by maximizing the recovery likelihood: the conditional probability of the data at a certain noise level given their noisy versions at a higher noise level. The recovery likelihood objective is more tractable than the marginal likelihood objective, since it only requires MCMC sampling from a relatively concentrated conditional distribution. Moreover, we show that this estimation method is theoretically consistent: it learns the correct conditional and marginal distributions at each noise level, given sufficient data. After training, synthesized images can be generated efficiently by a sampling process that initializes from a spherical Gaussian distribution and progressively samples the conditional distributions at decreasingly lower noise levels. Our method generates high fidelity samples on various image datasets. On unconditional CIFAR-10 our method achieves FID 9.60 and inception score 8.58, superior to the majority of GANs. Moreover, we demonstrate that unlike previous work on EBMs, our long-run MCMC samples from the conditional distributions do not diverge and still represent realistic images, allowing us to accurately estimate the normalized density of data even for high-dimensional datasets",

Recent work shows that nonsymmetric DPP kernels have significant advantages over symmetric kernels in terms of modeling power and predictive performance. However, the nonsymmetric kernel learning algorithm from prior work has computational complexity that is cubic in the size of the DPP ground set, from which subsets are drawn, making it impractical to use at large scales. In this work, we propose a new decomposition for nonsymmetric DPP kernels that induces linear-time complexity for learning and approximate maximum a posteriori (MAP) inference. We also prove a lower bound on the quality of this MAP approximation. Through evaluation on real-world datasets, we show that our new decomposition not only scales better, but also matches or exceeds the predictive performance of prior work",

    "abstract": "Visual cognition of primates is superior to that of artificial neural networks in its ability to 'envision' a visual object, even a newly-introduced one, in different attributes including pose, position, color, texture, etc. To aid neural networks to envision objects with different attributes, we propose a family of objective functions, expressed on groups of examples, as a novel learning framework that we term Group-Supervised Learning (GSL). GSL decomposes inputs into a disentangled representation with swappable components that can be recombined to synthesize new samples, trained through similarity mining within groups of exemplars. For instance, images of red boats & blue cars can be decomposed and recombined to synthesize novel images of red cars. We describe a general class of datasets admissible by GSL. We propose an implementation based on auto-encoder, termed group-supervised zero-shot synthesis network (GZS-Net) trained with our learning framework, that can produce a high-quality red car even if no such example is witnessed during training. We test our model and learning framework on existing benchmarks, in addition to new dataset that we open-source. We qualitatively and quantitatively demonstrate that GZS-Net trained with GSL outperforms state-of-the-art methods",

Previous poisoning attacks against deep neural networks have been limited in scope and success, working only in simplified settings or being prohibitively expensive for large datasets. In this work, we focus on a particularly malicious poisoning attack that is both \"from scratch\" and\"clean label\", meaning we analyze an attack that successfully works against new, randomly initialized models, and is nearly imperceptible to humans, all while perturbing only a small fraction of the training data. The central mechanism of this attack is matching the gradient direction of malicious examples. We analyze why this works, supplement with practical considerations. and show its threat to real-world practitioners, finding that it is the first poisoning method to cause targeted misclassification in modern deep networks trained from scratch on a full-sized, poisoned ImageNet dataset. Finally we demonstrate the limitations of existing defensive strategies against such an attack, concluding that data poisoning is a credible threat, even for large-scale deep learning systems",

    "abstract": "As an essential ingredient of modern deep learning, attention mechanism, especially self-attention, plays a vital role in the global correlation discovery. However, is hand-crafted attention irreplaceable when modeling the global context? Our intriguing finding is that self-attention is not better than the matrix decomposition (MD) model developed 20 years ago regarding the performance and computational cost for encoding the long-distance dependencies. We model the global context issue as a low-rank recovery problem and show that its optimization algorithms can help design global information blocks. This paper then proposes a series of Hamburgers, in which we employ the optimization algorithms for solving MDs to factorize the input representations into sub-matrices and reconstruct a low-rank embedding. Hamburgers with different MDs can perform favorably against the popular global context module self-attention when carefully coping with gradients back-propagated through MDs. Comprehensive experiments are conducted in the vision tasks where it is crucial to learn the global context, including semantic segmentation and image generation, demonstrating significant improvements over self-attention and its variants.

    "title": "Heating up decision boundaries: isocapacitory saturation, adversarial scenarios and generalization bounds",
    "abstract": "In the present work we study classiﬁers' decision boundaries via Brownian motion processes in ambient data space and associated probabilistic techniques. Intuitively, our ideas correspond to placing a heat source at the decision boundary and observing how effectively the sample points warm up. We are largely motivated by the search for a soft measure that sheds further light on the decision boundary's geometry. En route, we bridge aspects of potential theory and geometric analysis (Maz'ya (2011); Grigor'Yan & Saloff-Coste (2002)) with active ﬁelds of ML research such as adversarial examples and generalization bounds. First, we focus on the geometric behavior of decision boundaries in the light of adversarial attack/defense mechanisms. Experimentally, we observe a certain capacitory trend over different adversarial defense strategies: decision boundaries locally become ﬂatter as measured by isoperimetric inequalities (Ford et al. (2019)); however, our more sensitive heat-diffusion metrics extend this analysis and further reveal that some non-trivial geometry invisible to plain distance-based methods is still preserved. Intuitively, we provide evidence that the decision boundaries nevertheless retain many persistent \"wiggly and fuzzy\" regions on a ﬁner scale. Second, we show how Brownian hitting probabilities translate to soft generalization bounds which are in turn connected to compression and noise stability (Arora et al. (2018)), and these bounds are signiﬁcantly stronger if the decision boundary has controlled geometric features",

    "abstract": "Current reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms can be brittle and difficult to use, especially when learning goal-reaching behaviors from sparse rewards. Although supervised imitation learning provides a simple and stable alternative, it requires access to demonstrations from a human supervisor. In this paper, we study RL algorithms that use imitation learning to acquire goal reaching policies from scratch, without the need for expert demonstrations or a value function. In lieu of demonstrations, we leverage the property that any trajectory is a successful demonstration for reaching the final state in that same trajectory. We propose a simple algorithm in which an agent continually relabels and imitates the trajectories it generates to progressively learn goal-reaching behaviors from scratch. Each iteration, the agent collects new trajectories using the latest policy, and maximizes the likelihood of the actions along these trajectories under the goal that was actually reached, so as to improve the policy. We formally show that this iterated supervised learning procedure optimizes a bound on the RL objective, derive performance bounds of the learned policy, and empirically demonstrate improved goal-reaching performance and robustness over current RL algorithms in several benchmark tasks",

    "title": "Learning Better Structured Representations Using Low-rank Adaptive Label Smoothing",
    "abstract": "Training with soft targets instead of hard targets has been shown to improve performance and calibration of deep neural networks. Label smoothing is a popular way of computing soft targets, where one-hot encoding of a class is smoothed with a uniform distribution. Owing to its simplicity, label smoothing has found wide-spread use for training deep neural networks on a wide variety of tasks, ranging from image and text classification to machine translation and semantic parsing. Complementing recent empirical justification for label smoothing, we obtain PAC-Bayesian generalization bounds for label smoothing and show that the generalization error depends on the choice of the noise (smoothing) distribution. Then we propose low-rank adaptive label smoothing (LORAS): a simple yet novel method for training with learned soft targets that generalizes label smoothing and adapts to the latent structure of the label space in structured prediction tasks. Specifically, we evaluate our method on semantic parsing tasks and show that training with appropriately smoothed soft targets can significantly improve accuracy and model calibration, especially in low-resource settings. Used in conjunction with pre-trained sequence-to-sequence models, our method achieves state of the art performance on four semantic parsing data sets. LORAS can be used with any model, improves performance and implicit model calibration without increasing the number of model parameters, and can be scaled to problems with large label spaces containing tens of thousands of labels",

    "abstract": "For many tasks, the reward function is too complex to be specified procedurally, and must instead be learned from user data. Prior work has evaluated learned reward functions by examining rollouts from a policy optimized for the learned reward. However, this method cannot distinguish between the learned reward function failing to reflect user preferences, and the reinforcement learning algorithm failing to optimize the learned reward. Moreover, the rollout method is highly sensitive to details of the environment the learned reward is evaluated in, which often differ in the deployment environment. To address these problems, we introduce the Equivalent-Policy Invariant Comparison (EPIC) distance to quantify the difference between two reward functions directly, without training a policy. We prove EPIC is invariant on an equivalence class of reward functions that always induce the same optimal policy. Furthermore, we find EPIC can be precisely approximated and is more robust than baselines to the choice of visitation distribution. Finally, we find that the EPIC distance of learned reward functions to the ground-truth reward is predictive of the success of training a policy, even in different transition dynamics",

Particularly concerning are models with inconsistent performance on specific subgroups of a class, e.g., exhibiting disparities in skin cancer classification in the presence or absence of a spurious bandage. To mitigate these performance differences, we introduce model patching, a two-stage framework for improving robustness that encourages the model to be invariant to subgroup differences, and focus on class information shared by subgroups. Model patching first models subgroup features within a class and learns semantic transformations between them, and then trains a classifier with data augmentations that deliberately manipulate subgroup features. We instantiate model patching with CAMEL, which (1) uses a CycleGAN to learn the intra-class, inter-subgroup augmentations, and (2) balances subgroup performance using a theoretically-motivated subgroup consistency regularizer, accompanied by a new robust objective. We demonstrate CAMEL's effectiveness on 3 benchmark datasets, with reductions in robust error of up to 33% relative to the best baseline.

In most of these studies, the number of parameters is increased by increasing the network width. This begs the question: Is the observed improvement due to the larger number of parameters, or is it due to the larger width itself? We compare different ways of increasing model width while keeping the number of parameters constant. We show that for models initialized with a random, static sparsity pattern in the weight tensors, network width is the determining factor for good performance, while the number of weights is secondary, as long as trainability is ensured. As a step towards understanding this effect, we analyze these models in the framework of Gaussian Process kernels.

Our bound is highly relevant for fine-tuning, because providing a network with a good initialisation based on transfer learning means that learning can modify the weights less, and hence achieve tighter generalisation. Inspired by this, we develop a simple yet effective fine-tuning algorithm that constrains the hypothesis class to a small sphere centred on the initial pre-trained weights, thus obtaining provably better generalisation performance than conventional transfer learning. Empirical evaluation shows that our algorithm works well, corroborating our theoretical results.

As alternatives to CNNs, the recently proposed Capsule Networks (CapsNets) are shown to be more robust to white-box attack than CNNs under popular attack protocols. Besides, the class-conditional reconstruction part of CapsNets is also used to detect adversarial examples. In this work, we investigate the adversarial robustness of CapsNets, especially how the inner workings of CapsNets change when the output capsules are attacked. The first observation is that adversarial examples misled CapsNets by manipulating the votes from primary capsules. Another observation is the high computational cost, when we directly apply multi-step attack methods designed for CNNs to attack CapsNets, due to the computationally expensive routing mechanism. Motivated by these two observations, we propose a novel vote attack where we attack votes of CapsNets directly. Our vote attack is not only effective but also efficient by circumventing the routing process. Furthermore, we integrate our vote attack into the detection-aware attack paradigm, which can successfully bypass the class-conditional reconstruction based detection method.

    "abstract": "The goal of domain generalization algorithms is to predict well on distributions different from those seen during training. While a myriad of domain generalization algorithms exist, inconsistencies in experimental conditions -- datasets, architectures, and model selection criteria -- render fair and realistic comparisons difficult. In this paper, we are interested in understanding how useful domain generalization algorithms are in realistic settings. As a first step, we realize that model selection is non-trivial for domain generalization tasks. Contrary to prior work, we argue that domain generalization algorithms without a model selection strategy should be regarded as incomplete. Next, we implement DomainBed, a testbed for domain generalization including seven multi-domain datasets, nine baseline algorithms, and three model selection criteria. We conduct extensive experiments using DomainBed and find that, when carefully implemented, empirical risk minimization shows state-of-the-art performance across all datasets. Looking forward, we hope that the release of DomainBed, along with contributions from fellow researchers, will streamline reproducible and rigorous research in domain generalization",

    "title": "Supervised Contrastive Learning for Pre-trained Language Model Fine-tuning",
    "abstract": "State-of-the-art natural language understanding classification models follow two-stages: pre-training a large language model on an auxiliary task, and then fine-tuning the model on a task-specific labeled dataset using cross-entropy loss. Cross-entropy loss has several shortcomings that can lead to sub-optimal generalization and instability. Driven by the intuition that good generalization requires capturing the similarity between examples in one class and contrasting them with examples in other classes, we propose a supervised contrastive learning (SCL) objective for the fine-tuning stage. Combined with cross-entropy, the SCL loss we propose obtains improvements over a strong RoBERTa-Large baseline on multiple datasets of the GLUE benchmark in both the high-data and low-data regimes, and it does not require any specialized architecture, data augmentation of any kind, memory banks, or additional unsupervised data. We also demonstrate that the new objective leads to models that are more robust to different levels of noise in the training data, and can generalize better to related tasks with limited labeled task data",

Policy optimization under this setting is extremely challenging as: 1) the geometry of the objective function is hard to optimize efficiently; 2) the shift of data distributions causes high noise in the value estimation. In this work, we propose a simple yet effective policy iteration approach to batch RL using global optimization techniques known as continuation. By constraining the difference between the learned policy and the behavior policy that generates the fixed trajectories, and continuously relaxing the constraint, our method 1) helps the agent escape local optima; 2) reduces the error in policy evaluation in the optimization procedure.

    "abstract": "Pre-trained models for programming language have achieved dramatic empirical improvements on a variety of code-related tasks such as code search, code completion, code summarization, etc. However, existing pre-trained models regard a code snippet as a sequence of tokens, while ignoring the inherent structure of code, which provides crucial code semantics and would enhance the code understanding process. We present GraphCodeBERT, a pre-trained model for programming language that considers the inherent structure of code. Instead of taking syntactic-level structure of code like abstract syntax tree (AST), we use data flow in the pre-training stage, which is a semantic-level structure of code that encodes the relation of \"where-the-value-comes-from\" between variables. Such a semantic-level structure is neat and does not bring an unnecessarily deep hierarchy of AST, the property of which makes the model more efficient. We develop GraphCodeBERT based on Transformer. In addition to using the task of masked language modeling, we introduce two structure-aware pre-training tasks. One is to predict code structure edges, and the other is to align representations between source code and code structure. We implement the model in an efficient way with a graph-guided masked attention function to incorporate the code structure. We evaluate our model on four tasks, including code search, clone detection, code translation, and code refinement. Results show that code structure and newly introduced pre-training tasks can improve GraphCodeBERT and achieves state-of-the-art performance on the four downstream tasks. We further show that the model prefers structure-level attentions over token-level attentions in the task of code search",

From this, by approximating the empirical cumulative distribution using a differentiable function via splines, we obtain a recalibration function, which maps the network outputs to actual (calibrated) class assignment probabilities. The spine-fitting is performed using a held-out calibration set and the obtained recalibration function is evaluated on an unseen test set. We tested our method against existing calibration approaches on various image classification datasets and our spline-based recalibration approach consistently outperforms existing methods on KS error as well as other commonly used calibration measures",

    "abstract": "Subspace clustering is an unsupervised clustering technique designed to cluster data that is supported on a union of linear subspaces, with each subspace defining a cluster with dimension lower than the ambient space. Many existing formulations for this problem are based on exploiting the self-expressive property of linear subspaces, where any point within a subspace can be represented as linear combination of other points within the subspace. To extend this approach to data supported on a union of non-linear manifolds, numerous studies have proposed learning an appropriate kernel embedding of the original data using a neural network, which is regularized by a self-expressive loss function on the data in the embedded space to encourage a union of linear subspaces prior on the data in the embedded space. Here we show that there are a number of potential flaws with this approach which have not been adequately addressed in prior work. In particular, we show the model formulation is often ill-posed in multiple ways, which can lead to a degenerate embedding of the data, which need not correspond to a union of subspaces at all. We validate our theoretical results experimentally and additionally repeat prior experiments reported in the literature, where we conclude that a significant portion of the previously claimed performance benefits can be attributed to an ad-hoc post processing step rather than the clustering model",

We provide a detailed analysis of our experimental results, comparing multiple hyperparameter settings and formula representations. After training for several hours on a single GPU the results were surprising: the Transformer returns the syntactically equivalent trace in 89% of the cases on a held-out test set. Most of the \"mispredictions\", however, (and overall more than 99% of the predicted traces) still satisfy the given LTL formula.

While recent successes of model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) with deep function approximation have strengthened this hypothesis, the resulting diversity of model-based methods has also made it difficult to track which components drive success and why. In this paper, we seek to disentangle the contributions of recent methods by focusing on three questions: (1) How does planning benefit MBRL agents? (2) Within planning, what choices drive performance? (3) To what extent does planning improve generalization? To answer these questions, we study the performance of MuZero (Schrittwieser et al., 2019), a state-of-the-art MBRL algorithm with strong connections and overlapping components with many other MBRL algorithms. We perform a number of interventions and ablations of MuZero across a wide range of environments, including control tasks, Atari, and 9x9 Go. Our results suggest the following: (1) Planning is most useful in the learning process, both for policy updates and for providing a more useful data distribution. (2) Using shallow trees with simple Monte-Carlo rollouts is as performant as more complex methods, except in the most difficult reasoning tasks. (3) Planning alone is insufficient to drive strong generalization. These results indicate where and how to utilize planning in reinforcement learning settings, and highlight a number of open questions for future MBRL research",

    "abstract": "Learning disentangled representations leads to interpretable models and facilitates data generation with style transfer, which has been extensively studied on static data such as images in an unsupervised learning framework. However, only a few works have explored unsupervised disentangled sequential representation learning due to challenges of generating sequential data. In this paper, we propose recurrent Wasserstein Autoencoder (R-WAE), a new framework for generative modeling of sequential data. R-WAE disentangles the representation of an input sequence into static and dynamic factors (i.e., time-invariant and time-varying parts). Our theoretical analysis shows that, R-WAE minimizes an upper bound of a penalized form of the Wasserstein distance between model distribution and sequential data distribution, and simultaneously maximizes the mutual information between input data and different disentangled latent factors, respectively. This is superior to (recurrent) VAE which does not explicitly enforce mutual information maximization between input data and disentangled latent representations. When the number of actions in sequential data is available as weak supervision information, R-WAE is extended to learn a categorical latent representation of actions to improve its disentanglement. Experiments on a variety of datasets show that our models outperform other baselines with the same settings in terms of disentanglement and unconditional video generation both quantitatively and qualitatively",

To this end, we propose a novel multi-view classification method, termed trusted multi-view classification, which provides a new paradigm for multi-view learning by dynamically integrating different views at an evidence level. The algorithm jointly utilizes multiple views to promote both classification reliability and robustness by integrating evidence from each view. To achieve this, the Dirichlet distribution is used to model the distribution of the class probabilities, parameterized with evidence from different views and integrated with the DempsterShafer theory. The unified learning framework induces accurate uncertainty and accordingly endows the model with both reliability and robustness for out-ofdistribution samples.

In this work, we focus on estimating predictive distributions for bounding box regression output with variance networks. We show that in the context of object detection, training variance networks with negative log likelihood (NLL) can lead to high entropy predictive distributions regardless of the correctness of the output mean. We propose to use the energy score as a non-local proper scoring rule and find that when used for training, the energy score leads to better calibrated and lower entropy predictive distributions than NLL. We also address the widespread use of non-proper scoring metrics for evaluating predictive distributions from deep object detectors by proposing an alternate evaluation approach founded on proper scoring rules. Using the proposed evaluation tools, we show that although variance networks can be used to produce high quality predictive distributions, adhoc approaches used by seminal object detectors for choosing regression targets during training do not provide wide enough data support for reliable variance learning. We hope that our work helps shift evaluation in probabilistic object detection to better align with predictive uncertainty evaluation in other machine learning domains.

This intriguing double descent behavior also occurs as a function of training epochs and has been conjectured to arise because training epochs control the model complexity. In this paper, we show that such epoch-wise double descent arises for a different reason: It is caused by a superposition of two or more bias-variance tradeoffs that arise because different parts of the network are learned at different epochs, and eliminating this by proper scaling of stepsizes can significantly improve the early stopping performance. We show this analytically for i) linear regression, where differently scaled features give rise to a superposition of bias-variance tradeoffs, and for ii) a two-layer neural network, where the first and second layer each govern a bias-variance tradeoff. Inspired by this theory, we study two standard convolutional networks empirically and show that eliminating epoch-wise double descent through adjusting stepsizes of different layers improves the early stopping performance significantly",

    "title": "Task-Agnostic Morphology Evolution",
    "abstract": "Deep reinforcement learning primarily focuses on learning behavior, usually overlooking the fact that an agent's function is largely determined by form. So, how should one go about finding a morphology fit for solving tasks in a given environment? Current approaches that co-adapt morphology and behavior use a specific task's reward as a signal for morphology optimization. However, this often requires expensive policy optimization and results in task-dependent morphologies that are not built to generalize. In this work, we propose a new approach, Task-Agnostic Morphology Evolution (TAME), to alleviate both of these issues. Without any task or reward specification, TAME evolves morphologies by only applying randomly sampled action primitives on a population of agents. This is accomplished using an information-theoretic objective that efficiently ranks agents by their ability to reach diverse states in the environment and the causality of their actions. Finally, we empirically demonstrate that across 2D, 3D, and manipulation environments TAME can evolve morphologies that match the multi-task performance of those learned with task supervised algorithms.

We introduce the ETHICS dataset, a new benchmark that spans concepts in justice, well-being, duties, virtues, and commonsense morality. Models predict widespread moral judgments about diverse text scenarios. This requires connecting physical and social world knowledge to value judgements, a capability that may enable us to steer chatbot outputs or eventually regularize open-ended reinforcement learning agents. With the ETHICS dataset, we find that current language models have a promising but incomplete understanding of basic ethical knowledge.

To attain high accuracy on this test, models must possess extensive world knowledge and problem solving ability. We find that while most recent models have near random-chance accuracy, the very largest GPT-3 model improves over random chance by almost 20 percentage points on average. However, on every one of the 57 tasks, the best models still need substantial improvements before they can reach expert-level accuracy. Models also have lopsided performance and frequently do not know when they are wrong. Worse, they still have near-random accuracy on some socially important subjects such as morality and law. By comprehensively evaluating the breadth and depth of a model's academic and professional understanding, our test can be used to analyze models across many tasks and to identify important shortcomings",

    "title": "AdamP: Slowing Down the Slowdown for Momentum Optimizers on Scale-invariant Weights",
    "abstract": "Normalization techniques are a boon for modern deep learning. They let weights converge more quickly with often better generalization performances. It has been argued that the normalization-induced scale invariance among the weights provides an advantageous ground for gradient descent (GD) optimizers: the effective step sizes are automatically reduced over time, stabilizing the overall training procedure. It is often overlooked, however, that the additional introduction of momentum in GD optimizers results in a far more rapid reduction in effective step sizes for scale-invariant weights, a phenomenon that has not yet been studied and may have caused unwanted side effects in the current practice. This is a crucial issue because arguably the vast majority of modern deep neural networks consist of (1) momentum-based GD (e.g. SGD or Adam) and (2) scale-invariant parameters. In this paper, we verify that the widely-adopted combination of the two ingredients lead to the premature decay of effective step sizes and sub-optimal model performances. We propose a simple and effective remedy, SGDP and AdamP: get rid of the radial component, or the norm-increasing direction, at each optimizer step. Because of the scale invariance, this modification only alters the effective step sizes without changing the effective update directions, thus enjoying the original convergence properties of GD optimizers. Given the ubiquity of momentum GD and scale invariance in machine learning, we have evaluated our methods against the baselines on 13 benchmarks. They range from vision tasks like classification (e.g. ImageNet), retrieval (e.g. CUB and SOP), and detection (e.g. COCO) to language modelling (e.g. WikiText) and audio classification (e.g. DCASE) tasks. We verify that our solution brings about uniform gains in those benchmarks. Source code is available at this https URL",

Our approach models the conditional expectation between two observations with a neural ODE and jumps whenever a new observation is made. We deﬁne a novel training framework, which allows us to prove theoretical guarantees for the ﬁrst time. In particular, we show that the output of our model converges to the L 2 -optimal prediction.

    "title": "Stochastic Security: Adversarial Defense Using Long-Run Dynamics of Energy-Based Models",
    "abstract": "The vulnerability of deep networks to adversarial attacks is a central problem for deep learning from the perspective of both cognition and security. The current most successful defense method is to train a classifier using adversarial images created during learning. Another defense approach involves transformation or purification of the original input to remove adversarial signals before the image is classified. We focus on defending naturally-trained classifiers using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling with an Energy-Based Model (EBM) for adversarial purification. In contrast to adversarial training, our approach is intended to secure pre-existing and highly vulnerable classifiers. The memoryless behavior of long-run MCMC sampling will eventually remove adversarial signals, while metastable behavior preserves consistent appearance of MCMC samples after many steps to allow accurate long-run prediction. Balancing these factors can lead to effective purification and robust classification. We evaluate adversarial defense with an EBM using the strongest known attacks against purification. Our contributions are 1) an improved method for training EBM's with realistic long-run MCMC samples, 2) an Expectation-Over-Transformation (EOT) defense that resolves theoretical ambiguities for stochastic defenses and from which the EOT attack naturally follows, and 3) state-of-the-art adversarial defense for naturally-trained classifiers and competitive defense compared to adversarially-trained classifiers on Cifar-10, SVHN, and Cifar-100.

    "title": "Grounded Language Learning Fast and Slow",
    "abstract": "Recent work has shown that large text-based neural language models, trained with conventional supervised learning objectives, acquire a surprising propensity for few- and one-shot learning. Here, we show that an embodied agent situated in a simulated 3D world, and endowed with a novel dual-coding external memory, can exhibit similar one-shot word learning when trained with conventional reinforcement learning algorithms. After a single introduction to a novel object via continuous visual perception and a language prompt (\"This is a dax\"), the agent can re-identify the object and manipulate it as instructed (\"Put the dax on the bed\"). In doing so, it seamlessly integrates short-term, within-episode knowledge of the appropriate referent for the word \"dax\" with long-term lexical and motor knowledge acquired across episodes (i.e. \"bed\" and \"putting\"). We find that, under certain training conditions and with a particular memory writing mechanism, the agent's one-shot word-object binding generalizes to novel exemplars within the same ShapeNet category, and is effective in settings with unfamiliar numbers of objects. We further show how dual-coding memory can be exploited as a signal for intrinsic motivation, stimulating the agent to seek names for objects that may be useful for later executing instructions. Together, the results demonstrate that deep neural networks can exploit meta-learning, episodic memory and an explicitly multi-modal environment to account for 'fast-mapping', a fundamental pillar of human cognitive development and a potentially transformative capacity for agents that interact with human users",

Our lower bound implies that in the presence of label noise, ridgeless linear regression does not perform well around the interpolation threshold for any of these feature maps. We analyze the imposed assumptions in detail and provide a theory for analytic (random) feature maps. Using this theory, we can show that our assumptions are satisfied for input distributions with a (Lebesgue) density and feature maps given by random deep neural networks with analytic activation functions like sigmoid, tanh, softplus or GELU. As further examples, we show that feature maps from random Fourier features and polynomial kernels also satisfy our assumptions.

    "abstract": "Recent increases in the computational demands of deep neural networks (DNNs), combined with the observation that most input samples require only simple models, have sparked interest in $input$-$adaptive$ multi-exit architectures, such as MSDNets or Shallow-Deep Networks. These architectures enable faster inferences and could bring DNNs to low-power devices, e.g. in the Internet of Things (IoT). However, it is unknown if the computational savings provided by this approach are robust against adversarial pressure. In particular, an adversary may aim to slow down adaptive DNNs by increasing their average inference time$-$a threat analogous to the $denial$-$of$-$service$ attacks from the Internet. In this paper, we conduct a systematic evaluation of this threat by experimenting with three generic multi-exit DNNs (based on VGG16, MobileNet, and ResNet56) and a custom multi-exit architecture, on two popular image classification benchmarks (CIFAR-10 and Tiny ImageNet). To this end, we show that adversarial sample-crafting techniques can be modified to cause slowdown, and we propose a metric for comparing their impact on different architectures. We show that a slowdown attack reduces the efficacy of multi-exit DNNs by 90%-100%, and it amplifies the latency by 1.5-5$\\times$ in a typical IoT deployment. We also show that it is possible to craft universal, reusable perturbations and that the attack can be effective in realistic black-box scenarios, where the attacker has limited knowledge about the victim. Finally, we show that adversarial training provides limited protection against slowdowns. These results suggest that further research is needed for defending multi-exit architectures against this emerging threat",

    "title": "Representation learning for improved interpretability and classification accuracy of clinical factors from EEG",
    "abstract": "Despite extensive standardization, diagnostic interviews for mental health disorders encompass substantial subjective judgment. Previous studies have demonstrated that EEG-based neural measures can function as reliable objective correlates of depression, or even predictors of depression and its course. However, their clinical utility has not been fully realized because of 1) the lack of automated ways to deal with the inherent noise associated with EEG data at scale, and 2) the lack of knowledge of which aspects of the EEG signal may be markers of a clinical disorder. Here we adapt an unsupervised pipeline from the recent deep representation learning literature to address these problems by 1) learning a disentangled representation using $\\beta$-VAE to denoise the signal, and 2) extracting interpretable features associated with a sparse set of clinical labels using a Symbol-Concept Association Network (SCAN). We demonstrate that our method is able to outperform the canonical hand-engineered baseline classification method on a number of factors, including participant age and depression diagnosis. Furthermore, our method recovers a representation that can be used to automatically extract denoised Event Related Potentials (ERPs) from novel, single EEG trajectories, and supports fast supervised re-mapping to various clinical labels, allowing clinicians to re-use a single EEG representation regardless of updates to the standardized diagnostic system. Finally, single factors of the learned disentangled representations often correspond to meaningful markers of clinical factors, as automatically detected by SCAN, allowing for human interpretability and post-hoc expert analysis of the recommendations made by the model",

    "abstract": "Constructing large, labeled training datasets for segmentation models is an expensive and labor-intensive process. This is a common challenge in machine learning, addressed by methods that require few or no labeled data points such as few-shot learning (FSL) and weakly-supervised learning (WS). Such techniques, however, have limitations when applied to image segmentation—FSL methods often produce noisy results and are strongly dependent on which few datapoints are labeled, while WS models struggle to fully exploit rich image information. We propose a framework that fuses FSL and WS for segmentation tasks, enabling users to train high-performing segmentation networks with very few hand-labeled training points. We use FSL models as weak sources in a WS framework, requiring a very small set of reference labeled images, and introduce a new WS model that focuses on key areas—areas with contention among noisy labels—of the image to fuse these weak sources. Empirically, we evaluate our proposed approach over seven well-motivated segmentation tasks. We show that our methods can achieve within 1.4 Dice points compared to fully supervised networks while only requiring five hand-labeled training points. Compared to existing FSL methods, our approach improves performance by a mean 3.6 Dice points over the next-best method",

    "abstract": "Modern large-scale machine learning applications require stochastic optimization algorithms to be implemented on distributed compute systems. A key bottleneck of such systems is the communication overhead for exchanging information across the workers, such as stochastic gradients. Among the many techniques proposed to remedy this issue, one of the most successful is the framework of compressed communication with error feedback (EF). EF remains the only known technique that can deal with the error induced by contractive compressors which are not unbiased, such as Top-$K$. In this paper, we propose a new and theoretically and practically better alternative to EF for dealing with contractive compressors. In particular, we propose a construction which can transform any contractive compressor into an induced unbiased compressor. Following this transformation, existing methods able to work with unbiased compressors can be applied. We show that our approach leads to vast improvements over EF, including reduced memory requirements, better communication complexity guarantees and fewer assumptions. We further extend our results to federated learning with partial participation following an arbitrary distribution over the nodes, and demonstrate the benefits thereof. We perform several numerical experiments which validate our theoretical findings",

The latent variables in this model are explicitly aligned with high-level notions and concepts that are manifested in a set of demonstrations.

By measuring the tolerance level for an adversarial attack, we can extract a set of features that provides the most robust support for a prediction, and also can extract a set of features that contrasts the current prediction to a target class by setting a targeted adversarial attack.

The convexity implies invertibility and allows us to resort to convex optimization to solve the convex conjugate for efficient inversion. To enable maximum likelihood training, we derive a new gradient estimator of the log-determinant of the Jacobian, which involves solving an inverse-Hessian vector product using the conjugate gradient method. The gradient estimator has constant-memory cost, and can be made effectively unbiased by reducing the error tolerance level of the convex optimization routine.

Experimental results suggest that 1) RL-based approaches struggle to solve most of the tasks efficiently; 2) gradient-based approaches, by optimizing open-loop control sequences with the built-in differentiable physics engine, can rapidly find a solution within tens of iterations, but still fall short on multi-stage tasks that require long-term planning.

    "abstract": "Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are the predominant technique for learning over graphs. However, there is relatively little understanding of why GNNs are successful in practice and whether they are necessary for good performance. Here, we show that for many standard transductive node classification benchmarks, we can exceed or match the performance of state-of-the-art GNNs by combining shallow models that ignore the graph structure with two simple post-processing steps that exploit correlation in the label structure: (i) an \"error correlation\" that spreads residual errors in training data to correct errors in test data and (ii) a \"prediction correlation\" that smooths the predictions on the test data. We call this overall procedure Correct and Smooth (C&S), and the post-processing steps are implemented via simple modifications to standard label propagation techniques from early graph-based semi-supervised learning methods. Our approach exceeds or nearly matches the performance of state-of-the-art GNNs on a wide variety of benchmarks, with just a small fraction of the parameters and orders of magnitude faster runtime. For instance, we exceed the best known GNN performance on the OGB-Products dataset with 137 times fewer parameters and greater than 100 times less training time. The performance of our methods highlights how directly incorporating label information into the learning algorithm (as was done in traditional techniques) yields easy and substantial performance gains. We can also incorporate our techniques into big GNN models, providing modest gains. Our code for the OGB results is at this https URL",

    "abstract": "The volume of \"free\" data on the internet has been key to the current success of deep learning. However, it also raises privacy concerns about the unauthorized exploitation of personal data for training commercial models. It is thus crucial to develop methods to prevent unauthorized data exploitation. This paper raises the question: can data be made unlearnable for deep learning models? We present a type of error-minimizing noise that can indeed make training examples unlearnable. Error-minimizing noise is intentionally generated to reduce the error of one or more of the training example(s) close to zero, which can trick the model into believing there is \"nothing\" to learn from these example(s). The noise is restricted to be imperceptible to human eyes, and thus does not affect normal data utility.

    "title": "Evaluation of Neural Architectures trained with square Loss vs Cross-Entropy in Classification Tasks",
    "abstract": "Modern neural architectures for classification tasks are trained using the cross-entropy loss, which is widely believed to be empirically superior to the square loss. In this work we provide evidence indicating that this belief may not be well-founded. We explore several major neural architectures and a range of standard benchmark datasets for NLP, automatic speech recognition (ASR) and computer vision tasks to show that these architectures, with the same hyper-parameter settings as reported in the literature, perform comparably or better when trained with the square loss, even after equalizing computational resources. Indeed, we observe that the square loss produces better results in the dominant majority of NLP and ASR experiments. Cross-entropy appears to have a slight edge on computer vision tasks.   We argue that there is little compelling empirical or theoretical evidence indicating a clear-cut advantage to the cross-entropy loss. Indeed, in our experiments, performance on nearly all non-vision tasks can be improved, sometimes significantly, by switching to the square loss. Furthermore, training with square loss appears to be less sensitive to the randomness in initialization. We posit that training using the square loss for classification needs to be a part of best practices of modern deep learning on equal footing with cross-entropy",

While several machine learning methods have been proposed to learn PDEs directly from data, previous methods are limited to discrete-time approximations or make the limiting assumption of the observations arriving at regular grids. We propose a general continuous-time differential model for dynamical systems whose governing equations are parameterized by message passing graph neural networks. The model admits arbitrary space and time discretizations, which removes constraints on the locations of observation points and time intervals between the observations. The model is trained with continuous-time adjoint method enabling efficient neural PDE inference.

    "abstract": "Non-stationarity can arise in Reinforcement Learning (RL) even in stationary environments. For example, most RL algorithms collect new data throughout training, using a non-stationary behaviour policy. Due to the transience of this non-stationarity, it is often not explicitly addressed in deep RL and a single neural network is continually updated. However, we find evidence that neural networks exhibit a memory effect where these transient non-stationarities can permanently impact the latent representation and adversely affect generalisation performance. Consequently, to improve generalisation of deep RL agents, we propose Iterated Relearning (ITER). ITER augments standard RL training by repeated knowledge transfer of the current policy into a freshly initialised network, which thereby experiences less non-stationarity during training. Experimentally, we show that ITER improves performance on the challenging generalisation benchmarks ProcGen and Multiroom",

We present an approach for building and fitting deep latent variable models (DLVMs) in cases where the missing process is dependent on the missing data. Specifically, a deep neural network enables us to flexibly model the conditional distribution of the missingness pattern given the data. This allows for incorporating prior information about the type of missingness (e.g. self-censoring) into the model. Our inference technique, based on importance-weighted variational inference, involves maximising a lower bound of the joint likelihood. Stochastic gradients of the bound are obtained by using the reparameterisation trick both in latent space and data space. We show on various kinds of data sets and missingness patterns that explicitly modelling the missing process can be invaluable",

    "abstract": "Contrasting the previous evidence that neurons in the later layers of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) respond to complex object shapes, recent studies have shown that CNNs actually exhibit a 'texture bias': given an image with both texture and shape cues (e.g., a stylized image), a CNN is biased towards predicting the category corresponding to the texture. However, these previous studies conduct experiments on the final classification output of the network, and fail to robustly evaluate the bias contained (i) in the latent representations, and (ii) on a per-pixel level. In this paper, we design a series of experiments that overcome these issues. We do this with the goal of better understanding what type of shape information contained in the network is discriminative, where shape information is encoded, as well as when the network learns about object shape during training. We show that a network learns the majority of overall shape information at the first few epochs of training and that this information is largely encoded in the last few layers of a CNN. Finally, we show that the encoding of shape does not imply the encoding of localized per-pixel semantic information. The experimental results and findings provide a more accurate understanding of the behaviour of current CNNs, thus helping to inform future design choices",

    "abstract": "Time-series learning is the bread and butter of data-driven clinical decision support, and the recent explosion in ML research has demonstrated great potential in various healthcare settings. At the same time, medical time-series problems in the wild are challenging due to their highly composite nature: They entail design choices and interactions among components that preprocess data, impute missing values, select features, issue predictions, estimate uncertainty, and interpret models. Despite exponential growth in electronic patient data, there is a remarkable gap between the potential and realized utilization of ML for clinical research and decision support. In particular, orchestrating a real-world project lifecycle poses challenges in engineering (i.e. hard to build), evaluation (i.e. hard to assess), and efficiency (i.e. hard to optimize). Designed to address these issues simultaneously, Clairvoyance proposes a unified, end-to-end, autoML-friendly pipeline that serves as a (i) software toolkit, (ii) empirical standard, and (iii) interface for optimization. Our ultimate goal lies in facilitating transparent and reproducible experimentation with complex inference workflows, providing integrated pathways for (1) personalized prediction, (2) treatment-effect estimation, and (3) information acquisition. Through illustrative examples on real-world data in outpatient, general wards, and intensive-care settings, we illustrate the applicability of the pipeline paradigm on core tasks in the healthcare journey. To the best of our knowledge, Clairvoyance is the first to demonstrate viability of a comprehensive and automatable pipeline for clinical time-series ML",

    "title": "Training GANs with Stronger Augmentations via Contrastive Discriminator",
    "abstract": "Recent works in Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are actively revisiting various data augmentation techniques as an effective way to prevent discriminator overfitting. It is still unclear, however, that which augmentations could actually improve GANs, and in particular, how to apply a wider range of augmentations in training. In this paper, we propose a novel way to address these questions by incorporating a recent contrastive representation learning scheme into the GAN discriminator, coined ContraD. This \"fusion\" enables the discriminators to work with much stronger augmentations without increasing their training instability, thereby preventing the discriminator overfitting issue in GANs more effectively. Even better, we observe that the contrastive learning itself also benefits from our GAN training, i.e., by maintaining discriminative features between real and fake samples, suggesting a strong coherence between the two worlds: good contrastive representations are also good for GAN discriminators, and vice versa. Our experimental results show that GANs with ContraD consistently improve FID and IS compared to other recent techniques incorporating data augmentations, still maintaining highly discriminative features in the discriminator in terms of the linear evaluation. Finally, as a byproduct, we also show that our GANs trained in an unsupervised manner (without labels) can induce many conditional generative models via a simple latent sampling, leveraging the learned features of ContraD.

    "abstract": "While existing federated learning approaches mostly require that clients have fully-labeled data to train on, in realistic settings, data obtained at the client side often comes without any accompanying labels. Such deficiency of labels may result from either high labeling cost, or difficulty of annotation due to requirement of expert knowledge. Thus the private data at each client may be only partly labeled, or completely unlabeled with labeled data being available only at the server, which leads us to a new problem of Federated Semi-Supervised Learning (FSSL). In this work, we study this new problem of semi-supervised learning under federated learning framework, and propose a novel method to tackle it, which we refer to as Federated Matching (FedMatch). FedMatch improves upon naive federated semi-supervised learning approaches with a new inter-client consistency loss and decomposition of the parameters into parameters for labeled and unlabeled data. Through extensive experimental validation of our method in two different scenarios, we show that our method outperforms both local semi-supervised learning and baselines which naively combine federated learning with semi-supervised learning",

    "title": "AutoLRS: Automatic Learning-Rate Schedule by Bayesian Optimization on the Fly",
    "abstract": "The learning rate (LR) schedule is one of the most important hyper-parameters needing careful tuning in training DNNs. However, it is also one of the least automated parts of machine learning systems and usually costs significant manual effort and computing. Though there are pre-defined LR schedules and optimizers with adaptive LR, they introduce new hyperparameters that need to be tuned separately for different tasks/datasets. In this paper, we consider the question: Can we automatically tune the LR over the course of training without human involvement? We propose an efficient method, AutoLRS, which automatically optimizes the LR for each training stage by modeling training dynamics. AutoLRS aims to find an LR applied to every τ steps that minimizes the resulted validation loss. We solve this black-box optimization on the fly by Bayesian optimization (BO). However, collecting training instances for BO requires a system to evaluate each LR queried by BO's acquisition function for τ steps, which is prohibitively expensive in practice. Instead, we apply each candidate LR for only τ ′ τ steps and train an exponential model to predict the validation loss after τ steps. This mutual-training process between BO and the loss-prediction model allows us to limit the training steps invested in the BO search. We demonstrate the advantages and the generality of AutoLRS through extensive experiments of training DNNs for tasks from diverse domains using different optimizers. The LR schedules auto-generated by AutoLRS lead to a speedup of 1.22×, 1.43×, and 1.5× when training ResNet-50, Transformer, and BERT, respectively, compared to the LR schedules in their original papers, and an average speedup of 1.31× over state-of-the-art heavily-tuned LR schedules",

We show that this apparent gap vanishes when denoising the final Langevin samples using the score network. In addition, we propose two improvements to DSM-ALS: 1) Consistent Annealed Sampling as a more stable alternative to Annealed Langevin Sampling, and 2) a hybrid training formulation, composed of both Denoising Score Matching and adversarial objectives.

    "title": "Selective Classification Can Magnify Disparities Across Groups",
    "abstract": "Selective classification, in which models are allowed to abstain on uncertain predictions, is a natural approach to improving accuracy in settings where errors are costly but abstentions are manageable. In this paper, we find that while selective classification can improve average accuracies, it can simultaneously magnify existing accuracy disparities between various groups within a population, especially in the presence of spurious correlations. We observe this behavior consistently across five datasets from computer vision and NLP. Surprisingly, increasing the abstention rate can even decrease accuracies on some groups. To better understand when selective classification improves or worsens accuracy on a group, we study its margin distribution, which captures the model's confidences over all predictions. For example, when the margin distribution is symmetric, we prove that whether selective classification monotonically improves or worsens accuracy is fully determined by the accuracy at full coverage (i.e., without any abstentions) and whether the distribution satisfies a property we term left-log-concavity. Our analysis also shows that selective classification tends to magnify accuracy disparities that are present at full coverage. Fortunately, we find that it uniformly improves each group when applied to distributionally-robust models that achieve similar full-coverage accuracies across groups. Altogether, our results imply selective classification should be used with care and underscore the importance of models that perform equally well across groups at full coverage",

However, we observe that beyond a certain level of sparsity (approx 95%), these approaches fail to preserve the network performance, and to our surprise, in many cases perform even worse than trivial random pruning. To this end, we propose to find a skeletonized network with maximum foresight connection sensitivity (FORCE). Intuitively, out of all possible sub-networks, we propose to find the one whose connections would have a maximum impact on the loss when perturbed. Our approximate solution to maximize the FORCE, progressively prunes connections of a given network at initialization. This allows parameters that were unimportant at earlier stages of skeletonization to become important at later stages. In many cases, our approach enables us to remove up to 99.9% parameters, while keeping networks trainable and providing significantly better performance than recent approaches.

While prior work has typically conflated these by learning latent variables that directly correspond to label values, we argue this is contrary to the intended effect of supervision in VAEs—capturing rich label characteristics with the latents. For example, we may want to capture the characteristics of a face that make it look young, rather than just the age of the person. To this end, we develop the characteristic capturing VAE (CCVAE), a novel VAE model and concomitant variational objective which captures label characteristics explicitly in the latent space, eschewing direct correspondences between label values and latents. Through judicious structuring of mappings between such characteristic latents and labels, we show that the CCVAE can effectively learn meaningful representations of the characteristics of interest across a variety of supervision schemes. In particular, we show that the CCVAE allows for more effective and more general interventions to be performed, such as smooth traversals within the characteristics for a given label, diverse conditional generation, and transferring characteristics across datapoints",

We target fine-grained models as they arise in physical applications (e.g. molecular dynamics, agent-based models), the dynamics of which are strongly non-stationary but their transition to equilibrium is governed by unknown slow processes which are largely inaccessible by brute-force simulations. Approaches based on domain knowledge heavily rely on physical insight in identifying temporally slow features and fail to enforce the long-term stability of the learned dynamics. On the other hand, purely statistical frameworks lack interpretability and rely on large amounts of expensive simulation data (long and multiple trajectories) as they cannot infuse domain knowledge. The generative framework proposed achieves the aforementioned desiderata by employing a flexible prior on the complex plane for the latent, slow processes, and an intermediate layer of physics-motivated latent variables that reduces reliance on data and imbues inductive bias. In contrast to existing schemes, it does not require the a priori definition of projection operators or encoders and addresses simultaneously the tasks of dimensionality reduction and model estimation. We demonstrate its efficacy and accuracy in multiscale physical systems of particle dynamics where probabilistic, long-term predictions of phenomena not contained in the training data are produced",

    "abstract": "There has been increasing interest in building deep hierarchy-aware classifiers that aim to quantify and reduce the severity of mistakes, and not just reduce the number of errors. The idea is to exploit the label hierarchy (e.g., the WordNet ontology) and consider graph distances as a proxy for mistake severity. Surprisingly, on examining mistake-severity distributions of the top-1 prediction, we find that current state-of-the-art hierarchy-aware deep classifiers do not always show practical improvement over the standard cross-entropy baseline in making better mistakes. The reason for the reduction in average mistake-severity can be attributed to the increase in low-severity mistakes, which may also explain the noticeable drop in their accuracy. To this end, we use the classical Conditional Risk Minimization (CRM) framework for hierarchy-aware classification. Given a cost matrix and a reliable estimate of likelihoods (obtained from a trained network), CRM simply amends mistakes at inference time; it needs no extra hyperparameters and requires adding just a few lines of code to the standard cross-entropy baseline. It significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art and consistently obtains large reductions in the average hierarchical distance of top-$k$ predictions across datasets, with very little loss in accuracy. CRM, because of its simplicity, can be used with any off-the-shelf trained model that provides reliable likelihood estimates",

    "abstract": "Much recent effort has been invested in non-autoregressive neural machine translation, which appears to be an efficient alternative to state-of-the-art autoregressive machine translation on modern GPUs. In contrast to the latter, where generation is sequential, the former allows generation to be parallelized across target token positions. Some of the latest non-autoregressive models have achieved impressive translation quality-speed tradeoffs compared to autoregressive baselines. In this work, we reexamine this tradeoff and argue that autoregressive baselines can be substantially sped up without loss in accuracy. Specifically, we study autoregressive models with encoders and decoders of varied depths. Our extensive experiments show that given a sufficiently deep encoder, a single-layer autoregressive decoder can substantially outperform strong non-autoregressive models with comparable inference speed. We show that the speed disadvantage for autoregressive baselines compared to non-autoregressive methods has been overestimated in three aspects: suboptimal layer allocation, insufficient speed measurement, and lack of knowledge distillation. Our results establish a new protocol for future research toward fast, accurate machine translation. Our code is available at https://github.com/jungokasai/deep-shallow",

    "title": "Explaining the Efficacy of Counterfactually Augmented Data",
    "abstract": "In attempts to produce machine learning models less reliant on spurious patterns in training data, researchers have recently proposed a human-in-the-loop process for generating counterfactually augmented datasets. As applied in NLP, given some documents and their (initial) labels, humans are tasked with revising the text to make a (given) counterfactual label applicable. Importantly, the instructions prohibit edits that are not necessary to flip the applicable label. Models trained on the augmented (original and revised) data have been shown to rely less on semantically irrelevant words and to generalize better out-of-domain. While this work draws on causal thinking, casting edits as interventions and relying on human understanding to assess outcomes, the underlying causal model is not clear nor are the principles underlying the observed improvements in out-of-domain evaluation. In this paper, we explore a toy analog, using linear Gaussian models. Our analysis reveals interesting relationships between causal models, measurement noise, out-of-domain generalization, and reliance on spurious signals. Interestingly our analysis suggests that data corrupted by adding noise to causal features will degrade out-of-domain performance, while noise added to non-causal features may make models more robust out-of-domain. This analysis yields interesting insights that help to explain the efficacy of counterfactually augmented data. Finally, we present a large-scale empirical study that supports this hypothesis",

    "abstract": "A deep equilibrium model uses implicit layers, which are implicitly defined through an equilibrium point of an infinite sequence of computation. It avoids any explicit computation of the infinite sequence by finding an equilibrium point directly via root-finding and by computing gradients via implicit differentiation. In this paper, we analyze the gradient dynamics of deep equilibrium models with nonlinearity only on weight matrices and non-convex objective functions of weights for regression and classification. Despite non-convexity, convergence to global optimum at a linear rate is guaranteed without any assumption on the width of the models, allowing the width to be smaller than the output dimension and the number of data points. Moreover, we prove a relation between the gradient dynamics of the deep implicit layer and the dynamics of trust region Newton method of a shallow explicit layer. This mathematically proven relation along with our numerical observation suggests the importance of understanding implicit bias of implicit layers and an open problem on the topic. Our proofs deal with implicit layers, weight tying and nonlinearity on weights, and differ from those in the related literature",

We show that EquivCNP with translation equivariance achieves comparable performance to conventional CNPs in a 1D regression task.

    "title": "Rethinking Positional Encoding in Language Pre-training",
    "abstract": "How to explicitly encode positional information into neural networks is important in learning the representation of natural languages, such as BERT. Based on the Transformer architecture, the positional information is simply encoded as embedding vectors, which are used in the input layer, or encoded as a bias term in the self-attention module. In this work, we investigate the problems in the previous formulations and propose a new positional encoding method for BERT called Transformer with Untied Positional Encoding (TUPE). Different from all other works, TUPE only uses the word embedding as input. In the self-attention module, the word contextual correlation and positional correlation are computed separately with different parameterizations and then added together. This design removes the addition over heterogeneous embeddings in the input, which may potentially bring randomness, and gives more expressiveness to characterize the relationship between words/positions by using different projection matrices. Furthermore, TUPE unties the [CLS] symbol from other positions to provide it with a more specific role to capture the global representation of the sentence. Extensive experiments and ablation studies on GLUE benchmark demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method: TUPE outperforms several baselines on almost all tasks by a large margin. In particular, it can achieve a higher score than baselines while only using 30% pre-training computational costs. We release our code at this https URL",

    "title": "Universal Weakly Supervised Segmentation by Pixel-to-Segment Contrastive Learning",
    "abstract": "Weakly supervised segmentation requires assigning a label to every pixel based on training instances with partial annotations such as image-level tags, object bounding boxes, labeled points and scribbles. This task is challenging, as coarse annotations (tags, boxes) lack precise pixel localization whereas sparse annotations (points, scribbles) lack broad region coverage. Existing methods tackle these two types of weak supervision differently: Class activation maps are used to localize coarse labels and iteratively refine the segmentation model, whereas conditional random fields are used to propagate sparse labels to the entire image. We formulate weakly supervised segmentation as a semi-supervised metric learning problem, where pixels of the same (different) semantics need to be mapped to the same (distinctive) features. We propose 4 types of contrastive relationships between pixels and segments in the feature space, capturing low-level image similarity, semantic annotation, co-occurrence, and feature affinity. They act as priors; the pixel-wise feature can be learned from training images with any partial annotations in a data-driven fashion. In particular, unlabeled pixels in training images participate not only in data-driven grouping within each image, but also in discriminative feature learning within and across images. We deliver a universal weakly supervised segmenter with significant gains on Pascal VOC and DensePose. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/twke18/SPML",

We also found that heteroscedasticity at training time, perhaps acting as a regularizer, improves predictions at longer horizons. At the methodological side, we design metrics and an experimental protocol which can be used to evaluate the various models, predicting their asymptotic performance when using them on the control problem.

    "abstract": "As modern neural networks have grown to billions of parameters, meeting tight latency budgets has become increasingly challenging. Approaches like compression, sparsification and network pruning have proven effective to tackle this problem - but they rely on modifications of the underlying network. In this paper, we look at a complimentary approach of optimizing how tensors are mapped to on-chip memory in an inference accelerator while leaving the network parameters untouched. Since different memory components trade off capacity for bandwidth differently, a sub-optimal mapping can result in high latency. We introduce evolutionary graph reinforcement learning (EGRL) - a method combining graph neural networks, reinforcement learning (RL) and evolutionary search - that aims to find the optimal mapping to minimize latency. Furthermore, a set of fast, stateless policies guide the evolutionary search to improve sample-efficiency. We train and validate our approach directly on the Intel NNP-I chip for inference using a batch size of 1. EGRL outperforms policy-gradient, evolutionary search and dynamic programming baselines on BERT, ResNet-101 and ResNet-50. We achieve 28-78% speed-up compared to the native NNP-I compiler on all three workloads",

The optimal target distribution is then uniquely determined as an explicit EBM (Energy-Based Model) representation. From that optimal representation we then train a target controlled Autoregressive LM through an adaptive distributional variant of Policy Gradient. We conduct a first set of experiments over pointwise constraints showing the advantages of our approach over a set of baselines, in terms of obtaining a controlled LM balancing constraint satisfaction with divergence from the initial LM. We then perform experiments over distributional constraints, a unique feature of our approach, demonstrating its potential as a remedy to the problem of Bias in Language Models. Through an ablation study, we show the effectiveness of our adaptive technique for obtaining faster convergence.1",

We use SCAN and three new tasks to study learners' preferences for memorization, arithmetic, hierarchical, and compositional reasoning. Further, we connect to Solomonoff's theory of induction and propose to use description length as a principled and sensitive measure of inductive biases.   In our experimental study, we find that LSTM-based learners can learn to perform counting, addition, and multiplication by a constant from a single training example. Furthermore, Transformer and LSTM-based learners show a bias toward the hierarchical induction over the linear one, while CNN-based learners prefer the opposite. On the SCAN dataset, we find that CNN-based, and, to a lesser degree, Transformer- and LSTM-based learners have a preference for compositional generalization over memorization.

The guiding insight is to design optimization routines for these networks that are as close as possible to that of their well-tuned, non-decomposed counterparts; we back this intuition with an analysis of how the initialization and regularization schemes im-pact training with gradient descent, drawing on modern attempts to understand the interplay of weight-decay and batch-normalization. Empirically, we highlight the beneﬁts of spectral initialization and Frobenius decay across a variety of settings.

For knowledge distillation, Frobenius decay enables a simple, overcomplete baseline that yields a compact model from over-parameterized training without requiring retraining with or pruning a teacher network.

Existing attribution methods are non-scalable with respect to the number of models and lack theoretical bounds on attributability. This paper studies decentralized attribution, where provable attributability can be achieved by only requiring each model to be distinguishable from the authentic data. Our major contributions are the derivation of the sufficient conditions for decentralized attribution and the design of keys following these conditions. Specifically, we show that decentralized attribution can be achieved when keys are (1) orthogonal to each other, and (2) belonging to a subspace determined by the data distribution.

We demonstrate that DiffWave matches a strong WaveNet vocoder in terms of speech quality~(MOS: 4.44 versus 4.43), while synthesizing orders of magnitude faster. In particular, it significantly outperforms autoregressive and GAN-based waveform models in the challenging unconditional generation task in terms of audio quality and sample diversity from various automatic and human evaluations",

At the same time, their naive implementation is non-biological, since it seemingly requires the existence of many-body synaptic junctions between the neurons. We show that these models are effective descriptions of a more microscopic (written in terms of biological degrees of freedom) theory that has additional (hidden) neurons and only requires two-body interactions between them. For this reason our proposed microscopic theory is a valid model of large associative memory with a degree of biological plausibility. The dynamics of our network and its reduced dimensional equivalent both minimize energy (Lyapunov) functions. When certain dynamical variables (hidden neurons) are integrated out from our microscopic theory, one can recover many of the models that were previously discussed in the literature, e.g. the model presented in ''Hopfield Networks is All You Need'' paper. We also provide an alternative derivation of the energy function and the update rule proposed in the aforementioned paper and clarify the relationships between various models of this class",

We characterize this loss of expressivity in terms of a drop in the rank of the learned value network features, and show that this corresponds to a drop in performance. We demonstrate this phenomenon on widely studies domains, including Atari and Gym benchmarks, in both offline and online RL settings. We formally analyze this phenomenon and show that it results from a pathological interaction between bootstrapping and gradient-based optimization. We further show that mitigating implicit under-parameterization by controlling rank collapse improves performance",

    "abstract": "In recent years, meta-learning, in which a model is trained on a family of tasks (i.e. a task distribution), has emerged as an approach to training neural networks to perform tasks that were previously assumed to require structured representations, making strides toward closing the gap between humans and machines. However, we argue that evaluating meta-learning remains a challenge, and can miss whether meta-learning actually uses the structure embedded within the tasks. These meta-learners might therefore still be significantly different from humans learners. To demonstrate this difference, we first define a new meta-reinforcement learning task in which a structured task distribution is generated using a compositional grammar. We then introduce a novel approach to constructing a \"null task distribution\" with the same statistical complexity as this structured task distribution but without the explicit rule-based structure used to generate the structured task. We train a standard meta-learning agent, a recurrent network trained with model-free reinforcement learning, and compare it with human performance across the two task distributions. We find a double dissociation in which humans do better in the structured task distribution whereas agents do better in the null task distribution -- despite comparable statistical complexity. This work highlights that multiple strategies can achieve reasonable meta-test performance, and that careful construction of control task distributions is a valuable way to understand which strategies meta-learners acquire, and how they might differ from humans",

    "title": "Neural Mechanics: Symmetry and Broken Conservation Laws in Deep Learning Dynamics",
    "abstract": "Predicting the dynamics of neural network parameters during training is one of the key challenges in building a theoretical foundation for deep learning. A central obstacle is that the motion of a network in high-dimensional parameter space undergoes discrete finite steps along complex stochastic gradients derived from real-world datasets. We circumvent this obstacle through a unifying theoretical framework based on intrinsic symmetries embedded in a network's architecture that are present for any dataset. We show that any such symmetry imposes stringent geometric constraints on gradients and Hessians, leading to an associated conservation law in the continuous-time limit of stochastic gradient descent (SGD), akin to Noether's theorem in physics. We further show that finite learning rates used in practice can actually break these symmetry induced conservation laws. We apply tools from finite difference methods to derive modified gradient flow, a differential equation that better approximates the numerical trajectory taken by SGD at finite learning rates. We combine modified gradient flow with our framework of symmetries to derive exact integral expressions for the dynamics of certain parameter combinations. We empirically validate our analytic predictions for learning dynamics on VGG-16 trained on Tiny ImageNet. Overall, by exploiting symmetry, our work demonstrates that we can analytically describe the learning dynamics of various parameter combinations at finite learning rates and batch sizes for state of the art architectures trained on any dataset",

Most existing work is limited to compatible settings, where the state and action space dimensions are the same across tasks. Graph Neural Networks (GNN) are one way to address incompatible environments, because they can process graphs of arbitrary size. They also allow practitioners to inject biases encoded in the structure of the input graph. Existing work in graph-based continuous control uses the physical morphology of the agent to construct the input graph, i.e., encoding limb features as node labels and using edges to connect the nodes if their corresponded limbs are physically connected. In this work, we present a series of ablations on existing methods that show that morphological information encoded in the graph does not improve their performance. Motivated by the hypothesis that any benefits GNNs extract from the graph structure are outweighed by difficulties they create for message passing, we also propose Amorpheus, a transformer-based approach. Further results show that, while Amorpheus ignores the morphological information that GNNs encode, it nonetheless substantially outperforms GNN-based methods",

However, current methods are restricted in terms of their expressivity as they are focused on Euclidean representations. Persistence diagrams often contain features of infinite persistence (i.e., essential features) and Euclidean spaces shrink their importance relative to non-essential features because they cannot assign infinite distance to finite points. To deal with this issue, we propose a method to learn representations of persistence diagrams on hyperbolic spaces, more specifically on the Poincare ball. By representing features of infinite persistence infinitesimally close to the boundary of the ball, their distance to non-essential features approaches infinity, thereby their relative importance is preserved. This is achieved without utilizing extremely high values for the learnable parameters, thus, the representation can be fed into downstream optimization methods and trained efficiently in an end-toend fashion.

    "title": "Perceptual Adversarial Robustness: Defense Against Unseen Threat Models",
    "abstract": "We present adversarial attacks and defenses for the perceptual adversarial threat model: the set of all perturbations to natural images which can mislead a classifier but are imperceptible to human eyes. The perceptual threat model is broad and encompasses $L_2$, $L_\\infty$, spatial, and many other existing adversarial threat models. However, it is difficult to determine if an arbitrary perturbation is imperceptible without humans in the loop. To solve this issue, we propose to use a {\\it neural perceptual distance}, an approximation of the true perceptual distance between images using internal activations of neural networks. In particular, we use the Learned Perceptual Image Patch Similarity (LPIPS) distance. We then propose the {\\it neural perceptual threat model} that includes adversarial examples with a bounded neural perceptual distance to natural images. Under the neural perceptual threat model, we develop two novel perceptual adversarial attacks to find any imperceptible perturbations to images which can fool a classifier. Through an extensive perceptual study, we show that the LPIPS distance correlates well with human judgements of perceptibility of adversarial examples, validating our threat model. Because the LPIPS threat model is very broad, we find that Perceptual Adversarial Training (PAT) against a perceptual attack gives robustness against many other types of adversarial attacks. We test PAT on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet-100 against 12 types of adversarial attacks and find that, for each attack, PAT achieves close to the accuracy of adversarial training against just that perturbation type. That is, PAT generalizes well to unforeseen perturbation types. This is vital in sensitive applications where a particular threat model cannot be assumed, and to the best of our knowledge, PAT is the first adversarial defense with this property",

While the G-steerability constraint has been derived, it has to date only been solved for specific use cases - a general characterization of G-steerable kernel spaces is still missing. This work provides such a characterization for the practically relevant case of G being any compact group. Our investigation is motivated by a striking analogy between the constraints underlying steerable kernels on the one hand and spherical tensor operators from quantum mechanics on the other hand. By generalizing the famous Wigner-Eckart theorem for spherical tensor operators, we prove that steerable kernel spaces are fully understood and parameterized in terms of 1) generalized reduced matrix elements, 2) Clebsch-Gordan coefficients, and 3) harmonic basis functions on homogeneous spaces",

PDC model discovers information flows among dialogue turns through a semantic graph constructed based on lexical components in each question and answer. PDC model then learns to predict reasoning paths over this semantic graph. Our path prediction model predicts a path from the current turn through past dialogue turns that contain additional visual cues to answer the current question.

In this work, we conduct extensive experiments to verify and analyze the uncanny effectiveness of learning rate rewinding. We find that the reason behind the success of learning rate rewinding is the usage of a large learning rate. Similar phenomenon can be observed in other learning rate schedules that involve large learning rates, e.g., the 1-cycle learning rate schedule (Smith & Topin, 2019). By leveraging the right learning rate schedule in retraining, we demonstrate a counter-intuitive phenomenon in that randomly pruned networks could even achieve better performance than methodically pruned networks (fine-tuned with the conventional approach).

Class selectivity-typically defined as how different a neuron's responses are across different classes of stimuli or data samples-is commonly used for this purpose. However, it remains an open question whether it is necessary and/or sufficient for deep neural networks (DNNs) to learn class selectivity in individual units. We investigated the causal impact of class selectivity on network function by directly regularizing for or against class selectivity. Using this regularizer to reduce class selectivity across units in convolutional neural networks increased test accuracy by over 2% in ResNet18 trained on Tiny ImageNet. In ResNet20 trained on CIFAR10 we could reduce class selectivity by a factor of 2.5 with no impact on test accuracy, and reduce it nearly to zero with only a small ($\\sim$2%) drop in test accuracy. In contrast, regularizing to increase class selectivity had rapid and disastrous effects on test accuracy across all models and datasets. These results indicate that class selectivity in individual units is neither sufficient nor strictly necessary, and can even impair DNN performance.

Notably, recent studies have found that it is possible to find a trainable sparse neural network even at random initialization prior to training. While this approach of pruning at initialization turned out to be highly effective, there has been little study concerning the subsequent training of these sparse neural networks. In this work, we focus on studying the effects of data parallelism and sparsity on neural network training. For data parallelism, this usually means processing training data in parallel using distributed systems, or equivalently increasing batch size, so that the training process can be accelerated. To this end, we first measure the effects for different study cases of batch size and sparsity level while tuning all metaparameters involved in the optimization. As a result, we find across various workloads of data set, network model, and optimization algorithms that there exists a general scaling trend in the relationship between batch size and number of training steps to convergence for the effect of data parallelism, irrespective of sparsity levels. Also, the effect of data parallelism in training sparse networks turns out to be no worse, or can be even better when the training is done by a momentum based optimizer, than that in training densely parameterized networks, despite the general difficulty of training sparse networks. We further provide theoretical insights based on the convergence properties of stochastic gradient methods and a smoothness analysis, so as to precisely illustrate our empirical findings and hence to develop a better account of the effects of data parallelism and sparsity on neural network training",

Moreover, since such task-specific methods search for a neural architecture from scratch for every given task, they incur a large computational cost, which is problematic when the time and monetary budget are limited. In this paper, we propose an efficient NAS framework that is trained once on a database consisting of datasets and pretrained networks and can rapidly search a neural architecture for a novel dataset. The proposed MetaD2A (Meta Dataset-to-Architecture) model can stochastically generate graphs (architectures) from a given set (dataset) via a cross-modal latent space learned with amortized meta-learning. Moreover, we also propose a meta-performance predictor to estimate and select the best architecture from those sampled from MetaD2A. The experimental results demonstrate that our model meta-learned on subsets of ImageNet-1K and architectures from NAS-Bench 201 search space successfully generalizes to multiple benchmark datasets including CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100, with the search time of less than 30 GPU seconds on CIFAR-10.

Despite the recent advances in the literature, existing approaches are limited to moderately short-term prediction (less than a few seconds), while extrapolating it to a longer future quickly leads to destruction in structure and content. In this work, we revisit hierarchical models in video prediction. Our method predicts future frames by first estimating a sequence of semantic structures and subsequently translating the structures to pixels by videoto-video translation. Despite the simplicity, we show that modeling structures and their dynamics in the discrete semantic structure space with a stochastic recurrent estimator leads to surprisingly successful long-term prediction. We evaluate our method on three challenging datasets involving car driving and human dancing, and demonstrate that it can generate complicated scene structures and motions over a very long time horizon (i.e., thousands frames), setting a new standard of video prediction with orders of magnitude longer prediction time than existing approaches.

    "title": "Contrastive Learning with Adversarial Perturbations for Conditional Text Generation",
    "abstract": "Recently, sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) models with the Transformer architecture have achieved remarkable performance on various conditional text generation tasks, such as machine translation. However, most of them are trained with teacher forcing with the ground truth label given at each time step, without being exposed to incorrectly generated tokens during training, which hurts its generalization to unseen inputs, that is known as the ``exposure bias\" problem. In this work, we propose to mitigate the conditional text generation problem by contrasting positive pairs with negative pairs, such that the model is exposed to various valid or incorrect perturbations of the inputs, for improved generalization. However, training the model with naive contrastive learning framework using random non-target sequences as negative examples is suboptimal, since they are easily distinguishable from the correct output, especially so with models pretrained with large text corpora. Also, generating positive examples requires domain-specific augmentation heuristics which may not generalize over diverse domains. To tackle this problem, we propose a principled method to generate positive and negative samples for contrastive learning of seq2seq models. Specifically, we generate negative examples by adding small perturbations to the input sequence to minimize its conditional likelihood, and positive examples by adding large perturbations while enforcing it to have a high conditional likelihood. Such ``hard'' positive and negative pairs generated using our method guides the model to better distinguish correct outputs from incorrect ones. We empirically show that our proposed method significantly improves the generalization of the seq2seq on three text generation tasks - machine translation, text summarization, and question generation",

However, these methods have clear limitations in terms of availability of UID data and dependence of algorithms on pseudo-labels. Herein, we propose a data augmentation method to improve generalization in both adversarial and standard learning by using out-of-distribution (OOD) data that are devoid of the abovementioned issues. We show how to improve generalization theoretically using OOD data in each learning scenario and complement our theoretical analysis with experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and a subset of ImageNet. The results indicate that undesirable features are shared even among image data that seem to have little correlation from a human point of view. We also present the advantages of the proposed method through comparison with other data augmentation methods, which can be used in the absence of UID data. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the proposed method can further improve the existing state-of-the-art adversarial training",

However, without a clear consensus on \"how to choose,\" the layerwise sparsities are mostly selected algorithm-by-algorithm, often resorting to handcrafted heuristics or an extensive hyperparameter search. To ﬁll this gap, we propose a novel importance score for global pruning, coined layer-adaptive magnitude-based pruning (LAMP) score; the score is a rescaled version of weight magnitude that incorporates the model-level (cid:96) 2 distortion incurred by pruning, and does not require any hyperparameter tuning or heavy computation. Under various image classiﬁcation setups, LAMP consistently outperforms popular existing schemes for layerwise sparsity selection. Furthermore, we observe that LAMP continues to outperform baselines even in weight-rewinding setups, while the connectivity-oriented layerwise sparsity (the strongest baseline overall) performs worse than a simple global magnitude-based pruning in this case",

    "abstract": "The recent success of Transformers in the language domain has motivated adapting it to a multimodal setting, where a new visual model is trained in tandem with an already pretrained language model. However, due to the excessive memory requirements from Transformers, existing work typically fixes the language model and train only the vision module, which limits its ability to learn cross-modal information in an end-to-end manner. In this work, we focus on reducing the parameters of multimodal Transformers in the context of audio-visual video representation learning. We alleviate the high memory requirement by sharing the weights of Transformers across layers and modalities; we decompose the Transformer into modality-specific and modality-shared parts so that the model learns the dynamics of each modality both individually and together, and propose a novel parameter sharing scheme based on low-rank approximation. We show that our approach reduces parameters up to 80$\\%$, allowing us to train our model end-to-end from scratch. We also propose a negative sampling approach based on an instance similarity measured on the CNN embedding space that our model learns with the Transformers. To demonstrate our approach, we pretrain our model on 30-second clips from Kinetics-700 and transfer it to audio-visual classification tasks",

We propose that meta-learning algorithms can be potentially powerful data-driven tools for identifying the physical law governing Hamiltonian systems without any mathematical assumptions on the representation, but with observations from a set of systems governed by the same physical law.

Then, data instances are mixed in both the input and virtual label spaces, providing more augmented data during training. In experiments, we demonstrate that i-Mix consistently improves the quality of learned representations across domains, including image, speech, and tabular data.

    "abstract": "Stochastic optimization has become the workhorse behind many successful machine learning applications, which motivates a lot of theoretical analysis to understand its empirical behavior. As a comparison, there is far less work to study the generalization behavior especially in a non-convex learning setting. In this paper, we study the generalization behavior of stochastic optimization by leveraging the algorithmic stability for learning with β-gradient-dominated objective functions. We develop generalization bounds of the order O(1/(nβ)) plus the convergence rate of the optimization algorithm, where n is the sample size. Our stability analysis significantly improves the existing non-convex analysis by removing the bounded gradient assumption and implying better generalization bounds. We achieve this improvement by exploiting the smoothness of loss functions instead of the Lipschitz condition in Charles & Papailiopoulos (2018). We apply our general results to various stochastic optimization algorithms, which show clearly how the variance-reduction techniques improve not only training but also generalization.

However, most existing artificial memory modules are not very adept at storing spatial information. We propose a parameter-free module, Egospheric Spatial Memory (ESM), which encodes the memory in an ego-sphere around the agent, enabling expressive 3D representations. ESM can be trained end-to-end via either imitation or reinforcement learning, and improves both training efficiency and final performance against other memory baselines on both drone and manipulator visuomotor control tasks. The explicit egocentric geometry also enables us to seamlessly combine the learned controller with other non-learned modalities, such as local obstacle avoidance. We further show applications to semantic segmentation on the ScanNet dataset, where ESM naturally combines image-level and map-level inference modalities. Through our broad set of experiments, we show that ESM provides a general computation graph for embodied spatial reasoning, and the module forms a bridge between real-time mapping systems and differentiable memory architectures.

We negatively resolve this open problem by proving that any reasonable algorithm will exhibit limit cycles or diverge to infinite losses in some differentiable game, even in two-player games with zero-sum interactions. A reasonable algorithm is simply one which avoids strict maxima, an exceedingly weak assumption since converging to maxima would be the opposite of minimization. This impossibility theorem holds even if we impose existence of a strict minimum and no other critical points. The proof is constructive, enabling us to display explicit limit cycles for existing gradient-based methods.

PMI-Masking motivates, unifies, and improves upon prior more heuristic approaches that attempt to address the drawback of random uniform token masking, such as whole-word masking, entity/phrase masking, and random-span masking.

To address this issue, we propose dynamic channel fusion to replace dynamic attentions over channel groups. Dynamic channel fusion not only enables significant dimension reduction of the intermediate space, but also mitigates the joint optimization difficulty.

BRECQ leverages the basic building blocks in neural networks and reconstructs them one-by-one. In a comprehensive theoretical study of the second-order error, we show that BRECQ achieves a good balance between crosslayer dependency and generalization error. To further employ the power of quantization, the mixed precision technique is incorporated in our framework by approximating the inter-layer and intra-layer sensitivity. Extensive experiments on various handcrafted and searched neural architectures are conducted for both image classification and object detection tasks. And for the first time we prove that, without bells and whistles, PTQ can attain 4-bit ResNet and MobileNetV2 comparable with QAT and enjoy 240× faster production of quantized models.

We prove a universal approximation theorem of such linear functionals, and characterize the approximation rate and its relation with memory. Moreover, we perform a fine-grained dynamical analysis of training linear RNNs, which further reveal the intricate interactions between memory and learning. A unifying theme uncovered is the non-trivial effect of memory, a notion that can be made precise in our framework, on approximation and optimization: when there is long term memory in the target, it takes a large number of neurons to approximate it. Moreover, the training process will suffer from slow downs. In particular, both of these effects become exponentially more pronounced with memory - a phenomenon we call the \"curse of memory\".

In most cases, the assumption of independent and identically distributed samples across local clients does not hold for federated learning setups. Under this setting, neural network training performance may vary significantly according to the data distribution and even hurt training convergence. Most of the previous work has focused on a difference in the distribution of labels or client shifts. Unlike those settings, we address an important problem of FL, e.g., different scanners/sensors in medical imaging, different scenery distribution in autonomous driving (highway vs. city), where local clients store examples with different distributions compared to other clients, which we denote as feature shift non-iid. In this work, we propose an effective method that uses local batch normalization to alleviate the feature shift before averaging models. The resulting scheme, called FedBN, outperforms both classical FedAvg, as well as the state-of-the-art for non-iid data (FedProx) on our extensive experiments.

In this paper, we propose a novel defense framework Neural Attention Distillation (NAD) to erase backdoor triggers from backdoored DNNs. NAD utilizes a teacher network to guide the finetuning of the backdoored student network on a small clean subset of data such that the intermediate-layer attention of the student network aligns with that of the teacher network. The teacher network can be obtained by an independent finetuning process on the same clean subset.

In this work, we provide theoretical and empirical evidence that for depth-2 matrix factorization, gradient flow with infinitesimal initialization is mathematically equivalent to a simple heuristic rank minimization algorithm, Greedy Low-Rank Learning, under some reasonable assumptions. This generalizes the rank minimization view from previous works to a much broader setting and enables us to construct counter-examples to refute the conjecture from Gunasekar et al. (2018). We also extend the results to the case where depth $\\ge 3$, and we show that the benefit of being deeper is that the above convergence has a much weaker dependence over initialization magnitude so that this rank minimization is more likely to take effect for initialization with practical scale",

On one hand, it naturally factorizes convolution in a multiple dimension way, leading to a light computation burden. On the other hand, it can effectively enhance feature interaction from different channels, and progressively enlarge the 3D receptive field of such interaction to boost classification accuracy.

    "title": "Discovering Non-monotonic Autoregressive Orderings with Variational Inference",
    "abstract": "The predominant approach for language modeling is to encode a sequence of tokens from left to right, but this eliminates a source of information: the order by which the sequence was naturally generated. One strategy to recover this information is to decode both the content and ordering of tokens. Some prior work supervises content and ordering with hand-designed loss functions to encourage specific orders or bootstraps from a predefined ordering. These approaches require domain-specific insight. Other prior work searches over valid insertion operations that lead to ground truth sequences during training, which has high time complexity and cannot be efficiently parallelized. We address these limitations with an unsupervised learner that can be trained in a fully-parallelizable manner to discover high-quality autoregressive orders in a data driven way without a domain-specific prior. The learner is a neural network that performs variational inference with the autoregressive ordering as a latent variable. Since the corresponding variational lower bound is not differentiable, we develop a practical algorithm for end-to-end optimization using policy gradients. Strong empirical results with our solution on sequence modeling tasks suggest that our algorithm is capable of discovering various autoregressive orders for different sequences that are competitive with or even better than fixed orders",

    "title": "Auto Seg-Loss: Searching Metric Surrogates for Semantic Segmentation",
    "abstract": "Designing proper loss functions is essential in training deep networks. Especially in the field of semantic segmentation, various evaluation metrics have been proposed for diverse scenarios. Despite the success of the widely adopted cross-entropy loss and its variants, the mis-alignment between the loss functions and evaluation metrics degrades the network performance. Meanwhile, manually designing loss functions for each specific metric requires expertise and significant manpower. In this paper, we propose to automate the design of metric-specific loss functions by searching differentiable surrogate losses for each metric. We substitute the non-differentiable operations in the metrics with parameterized functions, and conduct parameter search to optimize the shape of loss surfaces. Two constraints are introduced to regularize the search space and make the search efficient. Extensive experiments on PASCAL VOC and Cityscapes demonstrate that the searched surrogate losses outperform the manually designed loss functions consistently. The searched losses can generalize well to other datasets and networks. Code shall be released",

SIR is based on two core ideas: task reduction and self-imitation. Task reduction tackles a hard-to-solve task by actively reducing it to an easier task whose solution is known by the RL agent. Once the original hard task is successfully solved by task reduction, the agent naturally obtains a self-generated solution trajectory to imitate. By continuously collecting and imitating such demonstrations, the agent is able to progressively expand the solved subspace in the entire task space. Experiment results show that SIR can significantly accelerate and improve learning on a variety of challenging sparse-reward continuous-control problems with compositional structures",

    "title": "HW-NAS-Bench: Hardware-Aware Neural Architecture Search Benchmark",
    "abstract": "HardWare-aware Neural Architecture Search (HW-NAS) has recently gained tremendous attention by automating the design of deep neural networks deployed in more resource-constrained daily life devices. Despite its promising performance, developing optimal HW-NAS solutions can be prohibitively challenging as it requires cross-disciplinary knowledge in the algorithm, micro-architecture, and device-specific compilation. First, to determine the hardware-cost to be incorporated into the NAS process, existing works mostly adopt either pre-collected hardware-cost look-up tables or device-specific hardware-cost models. The former can be time-consuming due to the required knowledge of the device's compilation method and how to set up the measurement pipeline, while building the latter is often a barrier for non-hardware experts like NAS researchers. Both of them limit the development of HW-NAS innovations and impose a barrier-to-entry to non-hardware experts. Second, similar to generic NAS, it can be notoriously difficult to benchmark HW-NAS algorithms due to their significant required computational resources and the differences in adopted search spaces, hyperparameters, and hardware devices. To this end, we develop HW-NAS-Bench, the first public dataset for HW-NAS research which aims to democratize HW-NAS research to non-hardware experts and make HW-NAS research more reproducible and accessible. To design HW-NAS-Bench, we carefully collected the measured/estimated hardware performance (e.g., energy cost and latency) of all the networks in the search spaces of both NAS-Bench-201 and FBNet, on six hardware devices that fall into three categories (i.e., commercial edge devices, FPGA, and ASIC). Furthermore, we provide a comprehensive analysis of the collected measurements in HW-NAS-Bench to provide insights for HW-NAS research. Finally, we demonstrate exemplary user cases to (1) show that HW-NAS-Bench allows non-hardware experts to perform HW-NAS by simply querying our premeasured dataset and (2) verify that dedicated device-specific HW-NAS can indeed lead to optimal accuracy-cost trade-offs.

    "abstract": "Dialogue state trackers have made significant progress on benchmark datasets, but their generalization capability to novel and realistic scenarios beyond the held-out conversations is less understood. We propose controllable counterfactuals (CoCo) to bridge this gap and evaluate dialogue state tracking (DST) models on novel scenarios, i.e., would the system successfully tackle the request if the user responded differently but still consistently with the dialogue flow? CoCo leverages turn-level belief states as counterfactual conditionals to produce novel conversation scenarios in two steps: (i) counterfactual goal generation at turn-level by dropping and adding slots followed by replacing slot values, (ii) counterfactual conversation generation that is conditioned on (i) and consistent with the dialogue flow. Evaluating state-of-the-art DST models on MultiWOZ dataset with CoCo-generated counterfactuals results in a significant performance drop of up to 30.8% (from 49.4% to 18.6%) in absolute joint goal accuracy. In comparison, widely used techniques like paraphrasing only affect the accuracy by at most 2%. Human evaluations show that CoCo-generated conversations perfectly reflect the underlying user goal with more than 95% accuracy and are as human-like as the original conversations, further strengthening its reliability and promise to be adopted as part of the robustness evaluation of DST models",

    "abstract": "We study the offline meta-reinforcement learning (OMRL) problem, a paradigm which enables reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms to quickly adapt to unseen tasks without any interactions with the environments, making RL truly practical in many real-world applications. This problem is still not fully understood, for which two major challenges need to be addressed. First, offline RL often suffers from bootstrapping errors of out-of-distribution state-actions which leads to divergence of value functions. Second, meta-RL requires efficient and robust task inference learned jointly with control policy. In this work, we enforce behavior regularization on learned policy as a general approach to offline RL, combined with a deterministic context encoder for efficient task inference. We propose a novel negative-power distance metric on bounded context embedding space, whose gradients propagation is detached from that of the Bellman backup. We provide analysis and insight showing that some simple design choices can yield substantial improvements over recent approaches involving meta-RL and distance metric learning. To the best of our knowledge, our method is the first model-free and end-to-end OMRL algorithm, which is computationally efficient and demonstrated to outperform prior algorithms on several meta-RL benchmarks",

Nonetheless, Convolutional Neural Networks are often biased towards either texture or shape, depending on the training dataset. Our ablation shows that such bias degenerates model performance. Motivated by this observation, we develop a simple algorithm for shape-texture debiased learning. To prevent models from exclusively attending on a single cue in representation learning, we augment training data with images with conflicting shape and texture information (e.g., an image of chimpanzee shape but with lemon texture) and, most importantly, provide the corresponding supervisions from shape and texture simultaneously. Experiments show that our method successfully improves model performance on several image recognition benchmarks and adversarial robustness. For example, by training on ImageNet, it helps ResNet-152 achieve substantial improvements on ImageNet (+1.2%), ImageNet-A (+5.2%), ImageNet-C (+8.3%) and Stylized-ImageNet (+11.1%), and on defending against FGSM adversarial attacker on ImageNet (+14.4%).

    "abstract": "Large-scale language models have recently demonstrated impressive empirical performance. Nevertheless, the improved results are attained at the price of bigger models, more power consumption, and slower inference, which hinder their applicability to low-resource (memory and computation) platforms. Knowledge distillation (KD) has been demonstrated as an effective framework for compressing such big models. However, large-scale neural network systems are prone to memorize training instances, and thus tend to make inconsistent predictions when the data distribution is altered slightly. Moreover, the student model has few opportunities to request useful information from the teacher model when there is limited task-specific data available. To address these issues, we propose MixKD, a data-agnostic distillation framework that leverages mixup, a simple yet efficient data augmentation approach, to endow the resulting model with stronger generalization ability. Concretely, in addition to the original training examples, the student model is encouraged to mimic the teacher's behavior on the linear interpolation of example pairs as well. We prove, from a theoretical perspective, that under reasonable conditions MixKD gives rise to a smaller gap between the generalization error and the empirical error. To verify its effectiveness, we conduct experiments on the GLUE benchmark, where MixKD consistently leads to significant gains over the standard KD training, and outperforms several competitive baselines. Experiments under a limited-data setting and ablation studies further demonstrate the advantages of the proposed approach",

    "abstract": "The mushroom body of the fruit fly brain is one of the best studied systems in neuroscience. At its core it consists of a population of Kenyon cells, which receive inputs from multiple sensory modalities. These cells are inhibited by the anterior paired lateral neuron, thus creating a sparse high dimensional representation of the inputs. In this work we study a mathematical formalization of this network motif and apply it to learning the correlational structure between words and their context in a corpus of unstructured text, a common natural language processing (NLP) task. We show that this network can learn semantic representations of words and can generate both static and context-dependent word embeddings. Unlike conventional methods (e.g., BERT, GloVe) that use dense representations for word embedding, our algorithm encodes semantic meaning of words and their context in the form of sparse binary hash codes. The quality of the learned representations is evaluated on word similarity analysis, word-sense disambiguation, and document classification. It is shown that not only can the fruit fly network motif achieve performance comparable to existing methods in NLP, but, additionally, it uses only a fraction of the computational resources (shorter training time and smaller memory footprint)",

    "title": "Anchor & Transform: Learning Sparse Embeddings for Large Vocabularies",
    "abstract": "Learning continuous representations of discrete objects such as text, users, movies, and URLs lies at the heart of many applications including language and user modeling. When using discrete objects as input to neural networks, we often ignore the underlying structures (e.g. natural groupings and similarities) and embed the objects independently into individual vectors. As a result, existing methods do not scale to large vocabulary sizes. In this paper, we design a simple and efficient embedding algorithm that learns a small set of anchor embeddings and a sparse transformation matrix. We call our method Anchor & Transform (ANT) as the embeddings of discrete objects are a sparse linear combination of the anchors, weighted according to the transformation matrix. ANT is scalable, flexible, and end-to-end trainable. We further provide a statistical interpretation of our algorithm as a Bayesian nonparametric prior for embeddings that encourages sparsity and leverages natural groupings among objects. By deriving an approximate inference algorithm based on Small Variance Asymptotics, we obtain a natural extension that automatically learns the optimal number of anchors instead of having to tune it as a hyperparameter. On text classification, language modeling, and movie recommendation benchmarks, we show that ANT is particularly suitable for large vocabulary sizes and demonstrates stronger performance with fewer parameters (up to 40x compression) as compared to existing compression baselines",

In particular, we show that very little change occurs in the informative eigenstructure even under drastic sparsification/quantization, and consequently that very little downstream performance loss occurs with very aggressively sparsified or quantized spectral clustering. We illustrate how these results depend on the nonlinearity, we characterize a phase transition beyond which spectral clustering becomes possible, and we show when such nonlinear transformations can introduce spurious non-informative eigenvectors",

For MPGNNs, our PACBayes bound improves over the Rademacher complexity based bound (Garg et al., 2020), showing a tighter dependency on the maximum node degree and the maximum hidden dimension. The key ingredients of our proofs are a perturbation analysis of GNNs and the generalization of PAC-Bayes analysis to non-homogeneous GNNs.

Recent work proposed that agents have access to a source of information that is effectively free: in any environment that humans have acted in, the state will already be optimized for human preferences, and thus an agent can extract information about what humans want from the state (Shah et al., 2019). Such learning is possible in principle, but requires simulating all possible past trajectories that could have led to the observed state. This is feasible in gridworlds, but how do we scale it to complex tasks? In this work, we show that by combining a learned feature encoder with learned inverse models, we can enable agents to simulate human actions backwards in time to infer what they must have done.

The current practice of using dequantization to map discrete data to a continuous space is inapplicable as categorical data has no intrinsic order.

In this paper, we investigate Categorical Normalizing Flows, that is normalizing flows for categorical data. By casting the encoding of categorical data in continuous space as a variational inference problem, we jointly optimize the continuous representation and the model likelihood. To maintain unique decoding, we learn a partitioning of the latent space by factorizing the posterior. Meanwhile, the complex relations between the categorical variables are learned by the ensuing normalizing flow, thus maintaining a close-to exact likelihood estimate and making it possible to scale up to a large number of categories. Based on Categorical Normalizing Flows, we propose GraphCNF a permutation-invariant generative model on graphs, outperforming both one-shot and autoregressive flow-based state-of-the-art on molecule generation",

However, automatic code summarization is challenging due to the complexity of the source code and the language gap between the source code and natural language summaries.

Recovering the wireframe is a challenging task, where the numbers of both vertices and edges are different for every instance, and a-priori unknown. Our architecture gradually builds up the model: It starts by encoding the points into feature vectors. Based on those features, it identifies a pool of candidate vertices, then prunes those candidates to a final set of corner vertices and refines their locations. Next, the corners are linked with an exhaustive set of candidate edges, which is again pruned to obtain the final wireframe. All steps are trainable, and errors can be backpropagated through the entire sequence.

    "abstract": "The embedding-based representation learning is commonly used in deep learning recommendation models to map the raw sparse features to dense vectors. The traditional embedding manner that assigns a uniform size to all features has two issues. First, the numerous features inevitably lead to a gigantic embedding table that causes a high memory usage cost. Second, it is likely to cause the over-fitting problem for those features that do not require too large representation capacity. Existing works that try to address the problem always cause a significant drop in recommendation performance or suffers from the limitation of unaffordable training time cost. In this paper, we proposed a novel approach, named PEP1 (short for Plug-in Embedding Pruning), to reduce the size of the embedding table while obviating a drop in accuracy and computational optimization. PEP prunes embedding parameter where the pruning threshold(s) can be adaptively learned from data. Therefore we can automatically obtain a mixed-dimension embeddingscheme by pruning redundant parameters for each feature. PEP is a general framework that can plug in various base recommendation models. Extensive experiments demonstrate it can efficiently cut down embedding parameters and boost the base model's performance. Specifically, it achieves strong recommendation performance while reducing 97-99% parameters. As for the computation cost, PEP only brings an additional 20-30% time cost compared with base models",

    "title": "A Universal Representation Transformer Layer for Few-Shot Image Classification",
    "abstract": "Few-shot classification aims to recognize unseen classes when presented with only a small number of samples. We consider the problem of multi-domain few-shot image classification, where unseen classes and examples come from diverse data sources. This problem has seen growing interest and has inspired the development of benchmarks such as Meta-Dataset. A key challenge in this multi-domain setting is to effectively integrate the feature representations from the diverse set of training domains. Here, we propose a Universal Representation Transformer (URT) layer, that meta-learns to leverage universal features for few-shot classification by dynamically re-weighting and composing the most appropriate domain-specific representations. In experiments, we show that URT sets a new state-of-the-art result on Meta-Dataset. Specifically, it achieves top-performance on the highest number of data sources compared to competing methods. We analyze variants of URT and present a visualization of the attention score heatmaps that sheds light on how the model performs cross-domain generalization.

    "title": "Towards Impartial Multi-task Learning",
    "abstract": "Multi-task learning (MTL) has been widely used in representation learning. However, naı̈vely training all tasks simultaneously may lead to the partial training issue, where specific tasks are trained more adequately than others. In this paper, we propose to learn multiple tasks impartially. Specifically, for the task-shared parameters, we optimize the scaling factors via a closed-form solution, such that the aggregated gradient (sum of raw gradients weighted by the scaling factors) has equal projections onto individual tasks. For the task-specific parameters, we dynamically weigh the task losses so that all of them are kept at a comparable scale. Further, we find the above gradient balance and loss balance are complementary and thus propose a hybrid balance method to further improve the performance. Our impartial multi-task learning (IMTL) can be end-to-end trained without any heuristic hyper-parameter tuning, and is general to be applied on all kinds of losses without any distribution assumption. Moreover, our IMTL can converge to similar results even when the task losses are designed to have different scales, and thus it is scale-invariant. We extensively evaluate our IMTL on the standard MTL benchmarks including Cityscapes, NYUv2 and CelebA. It outperforms existing loss weighting methods under the same experimental settings",

However, existing works have primarily focused on image classification tasks and neglected object detection which requires more annotation effort. In this work, we revisit the Semi-Supervised Object Detection (SS-OD) and identify the pseudo-labeling bias issue in SSOD. To address this, we introduce Unbiased Teacher1, a simple yet effective approach that jointly trains a student and a gradually progressing teacher in a mutually-beneficial manner. Together with a class-balance loss to downweight overly confident pseudo-labels, Unbiased Teacher consistently improved state-ofthe-art methods by significant margins on COCO-standard, COCO-additional, and VOC datasets. Specifically, Unbiased Teacher achieves 6.8 absolute mAP improvements against state-of-the-art method when using 1% of labeled data on MS-COCO, achieves around 10 mAP improvements against the supervised baseline when using only 0.5, 1, 2% of labeled data on MS-COCO",

    "title": "Isometric Propagation Network for Generalized Zero-shot Learning",
    "abstract": "Zero-shot learning (ZSL) aims to classify images of an unseen class only based on a few attributes describing that class but no access to any training sample. A popular strategy is to learn a mapping between the semantic space of class attributes and the visual space of images based on the seen classes and their data. Thus, an unseen class image can be ideally mapped to its corresponding class attributes. The key challenge is how to align the representations in the two spaces. For most ZSL settings, the attributes for each seen/unseen class are only represented by a vector while the seen-class data provide much more information. Thus, the imbalanced supervision from the semantic and the visual space can make the learned mapping easily overfitting to the seen classes. To resolve this problem, we propose Isometric Propagation Network (IPN), which learns to strengthen the relation between classes within each space and align the class dependency in the two spaces. Specifically, IPN learns to propagate the class representations on an auto-generated graph within each space. In contrast to only aligning the resulted static representation, we regularize the two dynamic propagation procedures to be isometric in terms of the two graphs' edge weights per step by minimizing a consistency loss between them. IPN achieves state-of-the-art performance on three popular ZSL benchmarks. To evaluate the generalization capability of IPN, we further build two larger benchmarks with more diverse unseen classes, and demonstrate the advantages of IPN on them",

    "title": "Loss Function Discovery for Object Detection via Convergence-Simulation Driven Search",
    "abstract": "Designing proper loss functions for vision tasks has been a long-standing research direction to advance the capability of existing models. For object detection, the well-established classification and regression loss functions have been carefully designed by considering diverse learning challenges (e.g. class imbalance, hard negative samples, and scale variances). Inspired by the recent progress in network architecture search, it is interesting to explore the possibility of discovering new loss function formulations via directly searching the primitive operation combinations. So that the learned losses not only fit for diverse object detection challenges to alleviate huge human efforts, but also have better alignment with evaluation metric and good mathematical convergence property. Beyond the previous auto-loss works on face recognition and image classification, our work makes the first attempt to discover new loss functions for the challenging object detection from primitive operation levels and finds the searched losses are insightful. We propose an effective convergence-simulation driven evolutionary search algorithm, called CSE-Autoloss, for speeding up the search progress by regularizing the mathematical rationality of loss candidates via two progressive convergence simulation modules: convergence property verification and model optimization simulation. CSE-Autoloss involves the search space (i.e. 21 mathematical operators, 3 constant-type inputs, and 3 variable-type inputs) that cover a wide range of the possible variants of existing losses and discovers best-searched loss function combination within a short time (around 1.5 wall-clock days with 20x speedup in comparison to the vanilla evolutionary algorithm). We conduct extensive evaluations of loss function search on popular detectors and validate the good generalization capability of searched losses across diverse architectures and various datasets. Our experiments show that the best-discovered loss function combinations outperform default combinations (Cross-entropy/Focal loss for classification and L1 loss for regression) by 1.1% and 0.8% in terms of mAP for two-stage and one-stage detectors on COCO respectively.

Our auxiliary loss is theoretically justified to learn representations that capture the structure of a new form of state-action abstraction, under which state-action pairs with similar return distributions are aggregated together.

In order to mitigate the observed overpruning effect of VI, we take inspiration from a common multi-task architecture, neural networks with task-specific FiLM layers, and find that this addition leads to significant performance gains, specifically for variational methods. In the small-data regime, GVCL strongly outperforms existing baselines.

Recent work attempts to understand why this recipe works and explain when it fails. Currently, such analyses have produced two sets of apparently-contradictory results. Work that analyzes the representations that result from pre-training (via \"probing classifiers\") finds evidence that rich features of linguistic structure can be decoded with high accuracy, but work that analyzes model behavior after fine-tuning (via \"challenge sets\") indicates that decisions are often not based on such structure but rather on spurious heuristics specific to the training set. In this work, we test the hypothesis that the extent to which a feature influences a model's decisions can be predicted using a combination of two factors: The feature's extractability after pre-training (measured using information-theoretic probing techniques), and the evidence available during finetuning (defined as the feature's co-occurrence rate with the label). In experiments with both synthetic and naturalistic data, we find strong evidence (statistically significant correlations) supporting this hypothesis",

Through theoretical analysis, we show that the function space of ImpFlow is strictly richer than that of ResFlows. Furthermore, for any ResFlow with a fixed number of blocks, there exists some function that ResFlow has a nonnegligible approximation error. However, the function is exactly representable by a single-block ImpFlow. We propose a scalable algorithm to train and draw samples from ImpFlows.

To estimate the impact of removing a parameter, these methods use importance measures that were originally designed to prune trained models. Despite lacking justification for their use early-on in training, such measures result in surprisingly low accuracy loss. To better explain this behavior, we develop a general gradient flow based framework that unifies state-of-the-art importance measures through the norm of model parameters. We use this framework to determine the relationship between pruning measures and evolution of model parameters, establishing several results related to pruning models early-on in training: (i) magnitude-based pruning removes parameters that contribute least to reduction in loss, resulting in models that converge faster than magnitude-agnostic methods; (ii) loss-preservation based pruning preserves first-order model evolution dynamics and is therefore appropriate for pruning minimally trained models; and (iii) gradient-norm based pruning affects second-order model evolution dynamics, such that increasing gradient norm via pruning can produce poorly performing models.

The hosted (source) model is susceptible to model stealing attacks, where an adversary derives a \\emph{surrogate model} from API access to the source model. For post hoc detection of such attacks, the provider needs a robust method to determine whether a suspect model is a surrogate of their model. We propose a fingerprinting method for deep neural network classifiers that extracts a set of inputs from the source model so that only surrogates agree with the source model on the classification of such inputs. These inputs are a subclass of transferable adversarial examples which we call \\emph{conferrable} adversarial examples that exclusively transfer with a target label from a source model to its surrogates. We propose a new method to generate these conferrable adversarial examples. We present an extensive study on the unremovability of our fingerprint against fine-tuning, weight pruning, retraining, retraining with different architectures, three model extraction attacks from related work, transfer learning, adversarial training, and two new adaptive attacks. Our fingerprint is robust against distillation, related model extraction attacks, and even transfer learning when the attacker has no access to the model provider's dataset.

    "title": "Generalization in data-driven models of primary visual cortex",
    "abstract": "Deep neural networks (DNN) have set new standards at predicting responses of neural populations to visual input. Most such DNNs consist of a convolutional network (core) shared across all neurons which learns a representation of neural computation in visual cortex and a neuron-specific readout that linearly combines the relevant features in this representation. The goal of this paper is to test whether such a representation is indeed generally characteristic for visual cortex, i.e. gener-alizes between animals of a species, and what factors contribute to obtaining such a generalizing core. To push all non-linear computations into the core where the generalizing cortical features should be learned, we devise a novel readout that reduces the number of parameters per neuron in the readout by up to two orders of magnitude compared to the previous state-of-the-art. It does so by taking advantage of retinotopy and learns a Gaussian distribution over the neuron's receptive field po-sition. With this new readout we train our network on neural responses from mouse primary visual cortex (V1) and obtain a gain in performance of 7% compared to the previous state-of-the-art network. We then investigate whether the convolutional core indeed captures general cortical features by using the core in transfer learning to a different animal. When transferring a core trained on thousands of neurons from various animals and scans we exceed the performance of training directly on that animal by 12%, and outperform a commonly used VGG16 core pre-trained on imagenet by 33%. In addition, transfer learning with our data-driven core is more data-efficient than direct training, achieving the same performance with only 40% of the data.

    "title": "Undistillable: Making A Nasty Teacher That CANNOT teach students",
    "abstract": "Knowledge Distillation (KD) is a widely used technique to transfer knowledge from pre-trained teacher models to (usually more lightweight) student models. However, in certain situations, this technique is more of a curse than a blessing. For instance, KD poses a potential risk of exposing intellectual properties (IPs): even if a trained machine learning model is released in \"black boxes\" (e.g., as executable software or APIs without open-sourcing code), it can still be replicated by KD through imitating input-output behaviors. To prevent this unwanted effect of KD, this paper introduces and investigates a concept called Nasty Teacher: a specially trained teacher network that yields nearly the same performance as a normal one, but would significantly degrade the performance of student models learned by imitating it. We propose a simple yet effective algorithm to build the nasty teacher, called self-undermining knowledge distillation. Specifically, we aim to maximize the difference between the output of the nasty teacher and a normal pretrained network. Extensive experiments on several datasets demonstrate that our method is effective on both standard KD and data-free KD, providing the desirable KD-immunity to model owners for the first time. We hope our preliminary study can draw more awareness and interest in this new practical problem of both social and legal importance.

    "title": "Greedy-GQ with Variance Reduction: Finite-time Analysis and Improved Complexity",
    "abstract": "Greedy-GQ is a value-based reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm for optimal control. Recently, the finite-time analysis of Greedy-GQ has been developed under linear function approximation and Markovian sampling, and the algorithm is shown to achieve an -stationary point with a sample complexity in the order of O( −3). Such a high sample complexity is due to the large variance induced by the Markovian samples. In this paper, we propose a variance-reduced Greedy-GQ (VR-Greedy-GQ) algorithm for off-policy optimal control. In particular, the algorithm applies the SVRG-based variance reduction scheme to reduce the stochastic variance of the two time-scale updates. We study the finite-time convergence of VR-Greedy-GQ under linear function approximation and Markovian sampling and show that the algorithm achieves a much smaller bias and variance error than the original Greedy-GQ. In particular, we prove that VR-Greedy-GQ achieves an improved sample complexity that is in the order of O( −2). We further compare the performance of VR-Greedy-GQ with that of Greedy-GQ in various RL experiments to corroborate our theoretical findings",

    "abstract": "Contrastive learning has been shown to produce generalizable representations of audio and visual data by maximizing the lower bound on the mutual information (MI) between different views of an instance. However, obtaining a tight lower bound requires a sample size exponential in MI and thus a large set of negative samples. We can incorporate more samples by building a large queue-based dictionary, but there are theoretical limits to performance improvements even with a large number of negative samples. We hypothesize that random negative sampling leads to a highly redundant dictionary that results in suboptimal representations for downstream tasks. In this paper, we propose an active contrastive learning approach that builds an actively sampled dictionary with diverse and informative items, which improves the quality of negative samples and improves performances on tasks where there is high mutual information in the data, e.g., video classification.

    "abstract": "A common approach for compressing NLP networks is to encode the embedding layer as a matrix $A\\in\\mathbb{R}^{n\\times d}$, compute its rank-$j$ approximation $A_j$ via SVD, and then factor $A_j$ into a pair of matrices that correspond to smaller fully-connected layers to replace the original embedding layer. Geometrically, the rows of $A$ represent points in $\\mathbb{R}^d$, and the rows of $A_j$ represent their projections onto the $j$-dimensional subspace that minimizes the sum of squared distances (\"errors\") to the points. In practice, these rows of $A$ may be spread around $k>1$ subspaces, so factoring $A$ based on a single subspace may lead to large errors that turn into large drops in accuracy.   Inspired by \\emph{projective clustering} from computational geometry, we suggest replacing this subspace by a set of $k$ subspaces, each of dimension $j$, that minimizes the sum of squared distances over every point (row in $A$) to its \\emph{closest} subspace. Based on this approach, we provide a novel architecture that replaces the original embedding layer by a set of $k$ small layers that operate in parallel and are then recombined with a single fully-connected layer.   Extensive experimental results on the GLUE benchmark yield networks that are both more accurate and smaller compared to the standard matrix factorization (SVD). For example, we further compress DistilBERT by reducing the size of the embedding layer by $40\\%$ while incurring only a $0.5\\%$ average drop in accuracy over all nine GLUE tasks, compared to a $2.8\\%$ drop using the existing SVD approach. On RoBERTa we achieve $43\\%$ compression of the embedding layer with less than a $0.8\\%$ average drop in accuracy as compared to a $3\\%$ drop previously.

    "abstract": "Decomposing knowledge into interchangeable pieces promises a generalization advantage when there are changes in distribution. A learning agent interacting with its environment is likely to be faced with situations requiring novel combinations of existing pieces of knowledge. We hypothesize that such a decomposition of knowledge is particularly relevant for being able to generalize in a systematic manner to out-of-distribution changes. To study these ideas, we propose a particular training framework in which we assume that the pieces of knowledge an agent needs and its reward function are stationary and can be re-used across tasks. An attention mechanism dynamically selects which modules can be adapted to the current task, and the parameters of the selected modules are allowed to change quickly as the learner is confronted with variations in what it experiences, while the parameters of the attention mechanisms act as stable, slowly changing, meta-parameters. We focus on pieces of knowledge captured by an ensemble of modules sparsely communicating with each other via a bottleneck of attention. We find that meta-learning the modular aspects of the proposed system greatly helps in achieving faster adaptation in a reinforcement learning setup involving navigation in a partially observed grid world with image-level input. We also find that reversing the role of parameters and meta-parameters does not work nearly as well, suggesting a particular role for fast adaptation of the dynamically selected modules",

Since such models are general-purpose feature extractors, many of these features are inevitably irrelevant for a given target task. We propose to use Variational Information Bottleneck (VIB) to suppress irrelevant features when fine-tuning on low-resource target tasks, and show that our method successfully reduces overfitting. Moreover, we show that our VIB model finds sentence representations that are more robust to biases in natural language inference datasets, and thereby obtains better generalization to out-of-domain datasets. Evaluation on seven low-resource datasets in different tasks shows that our method significantly improves transfer learning in low-resource scenarios, surpassing prior work.

A score is defined to be the gradient of the log density with respect to the input data. Our methodology is completely unsupervised and follows a straight forward training scheme. First, we train a deep network to estimate scores for levels of noise. Once trained, we calculate the noisy score estimates for N in-distribution samples and take the L2-norms across the input dimensions (resulting in an NxL matrix). Then we train an auxiliary model (such as a Gaussian Mixture Model) to learn the in-distribution spatial regions in this L-dimensional space. This auxiliary model can now be used to identify points that reside outside the learned space. Despite its simplicity, our experiments show that this methodology significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art in detecting out-of-distribution images. For example, our method can effectively separate CIFAR-10 (inlier) and SVHN (OOD) images, a setting which has been previously shown to be difficult for deep likelihood models",

In this work, we construct explicitly multi-timescale language models by manipulating the input and forget gate biases in a long short-term memory (LSTM) network. The distribution of timescales is selected to approximate power law statistics of natural language through a combination of exponentially decaying memory cells. We then empirically analyze the timescale of information routed through each part of the model using word ablation experiments and forget gate visualizations. These experiments show that the multi-timescale model successfully learns representations at the desired timescales, and that the distribution includes longer timescales than a standard LSTM. Further, information about high-,mid-, and low-frequency words is routed preferentially through units with the appropriate timescales.

    "title": "Dataset Inference: Ownership Resolution in Machine Learning",
    "abstract": "With increasingly more data and computation involved in their training, machine learning models constitute valuable intellectual property. This has spurred interest in model stealing, which is made more practical by advances in learning with partial, little, or no supervision. Existing defenses focus on inserting unique watermarks in a model's decision surface, but this is insufficient: the watermarks are not sampled from the training distribution and thus are not always preserved during model stealing. In this paper, we make the key observation that knowledge contained in the stolen model's training set is what is common to all stolen copies. The adversary's goal, irrespective of the attack employed, is always to extract this knowledge or its by-products. This gives the original model's owner a strong advantage over the adversary: model owners have access to the original training data. We thus introduce dataset inference, the process of identifying whether a suspected model copy has private knowledge from the original model's dataset, as a defense against model stealing. We develop an approach for dataset inference that combines statistical testing with the ability to estimate the distance of multiple data points to the decision boundary. Our experiments on CIFAR10, SVHN, CIFAR100 and ImageNet show that model owners can claim with confidence greater than 99% that their model (or dataset as a matter of fact) was stolen, despite only exposing 50 of the stolen model's training points. Dataset inference defends against state-of-the-art attacks even when the adversary is adaptive. Unlike prior work, it does not require retraining or overfitting the defended model.1",

While gradient boosting classification models return a distribution over class labels, regressions models typically yield only point predictions. However, for many practical, high-risk applications, it is also important to be able to quantify uncertainty in the predictions to avoid costly mistakes. In this work, we examine a probabilistic ensemble-based framework for deriving uncertainty estimates in the predictions of gradient boosting classification and regression models. Crucially, the proposed approach allows the total uncertainty to be decomposed into \\textit{data uncertainty}, which comes from the complexity and noise in data distribution, and \\textit{knowledge uncertainty}, coming from the lack of information about a given region of the feature space. Two approaches for generating ensembles are considered: Stochastic Gradient Boosting (SGB) and Stochastic Gradient Langevin Boosting (SGLB). Notably, SGLB also enables the generation of a \\emph{virtual} ensemble via only one gradient boosting model, which significantly reduces complexity. Experiments on a range of regression and classification datasets show that ensembles of gradient boosting models yield improved predictive performance, and measures of uncertainty successfully enable detection of out-of-domain inputs",

We propose Graph Traversal via Tensor Functionals (GTTF), a unifying meta-algorithm framework for easing the implementation of diverse graph algorithms and enabling transparent and efficient scaling to large graphs. GTTF is founded upon a data structure (stored as a sparse tensor) and a stochastic graph traversal algorithm (described using tensor operations). The algorithm is a functional that accept two functions, and can be specialized to obtain a variety of GRL models and objectives, simply by changing those two functions. We show for a wide class of methods, our algorithm learns in an unbiased fashion and, in expectation, approximates the learning as if the specialized implementations were run directly.

We propose a novel model-based algorithm, Behavior-Regularized Model-ENsemble (BREMEN) that can effectively optimize a policy offline using 10-20 times fewer data than prior works. Furthermore, the recursive application of BREMEN is able to achieve impressive deployment efficiency while maintaining the same or better sample efficiency, learning successful policies from scratch on simulated robotic environments with only 5-10 deployments, compared to typical values of hundreds to millions in standard RL baselines.

However, the bottleneck of indexing a large number of dense vectors and performing an NNS hurts the query time and accuracy of these models. In this paper, we argue that high-dimensional and ultra-sparse embedding is a significantly superior alternative to dense low-dimensional embedding for both query efficiency and accuracy. Extreme sparsity eliminates the need for NNS by replacing them with simple lookups, while its high dimensionality ensures that the embeddings are informative even when sparse. However, learning extremely high dimensional embeddings leads to blow up in the model size. To make the training feasible, we propose a partitioning algorithm that learns such high dimensional embeddings across multiple GPUs without any communication. This is facilitated by our novel asymmetric mixture of Sparse, Orthogonal, Learned and Random (SOLAR) Embeddings. The label vectors are random, sparse, and near-orthogonal by design, while the query vectors are learned and sparse. We theoretically prove that our way of one-sided learning is equivalent to learning both query and label embeddings. With these unique properties, we can successfully train 500K dimensional SOLAR embeddings for the tasks of searching through 1.6M books and multi-label classification on the three largest public datasets.

    "abstract": "Powered by innovations in novel architecture design, noise tolerance techniques and increasing model capacity, Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) has made giant strides in reducing word-error-rate over the past decade. ASR models are often trained with tens of thousand hours of high quality speech data to produce state-of-the-art (SOTA) results. Industry-scale ASR model training thus remains computationally heavy and time-consuming, and consequently has attracted little attention in adopting automatic techniques. On the other hand, Neural Architecture Search (NAS) has gained a lot of interest in the recent years thanks to its successes in discovering efficient architectures, often outperforming handcrafted alternatives. However, by changing the standard training process into a bi-level optimisation problem, NAS approaches often require significantly more time and computational power compared to single-model training, and at the same time increase complexity of the overall process. As a result, NAS has been predominately applied to problems which do not require as extensive training as ASR, and even then reproducibility of NAS algorithms is often problematic. Lately, a number of benchmark datasets has been introduced to address reproducibility issues by providing NAS researchers with information about performance of different models obtained through exhaustive evaluation. However, these datasets focus mainly on computer vision and NLP tasks and thus suffer from limited coverage of application domains. In order to increase diversity in the existing NAS benchmarks, and at the same time provide systematic study of the effects of architectural choices for ASR, we release NAS-Bench-ASR – the first NAS benchmark for ASR models.

    "abstract": "We construct an experimental setup in which changing the scale of initialization strongly impacts the implicit regularization induced by SGD, interpolating from good generalization performance to completely memorizing the training set while making little progress on the test set. Moreover, we find that the extent and manner in which generalization ability is affected depends on the activation and loss function used, with $\\sin$ activation being the most extreme. In the case of the homogeneous ReLU activation, we show that this behavior can be attributed to the loss function. Our empirical investigation reveals that increasing the scale of initialization could cause the representations and gradients to be increasingly misaligned across examples in the same class. We further demonstrate that a similar misalignment phenomenon occurs in other scenarios affecting generalization performance, such as changes to the architecture or data distribution",

Learning such compositional structures has been a significant challenge for artificial systems, due to the combinatorial nature of the underlying search problem. To date, research into compositional learning has largely proceeded separately from work on lifelong or continual learning. We integrate these two lines of work to present a general-purpose framework for lifelong learning of compositional structures that can be used for solving a stream of related tasks. Our framework separates the learning process into two broad stages: learning how to best combine existing components in order to assimilate a novel problem, and learning how to adapt the set of existing components to accommodate the new problem. This separation explicitly handles the trade-off between the stability required to remember how to solve earlier tasks and the flexibility required to solve new tasks, as we show empirically in an extensive evaluation",

Unrolling is believed to incorporate the model-based prior with the learning capacity of deep learning. This paper revisits the role of unrolling as a design approach for deep networks: to what extent its resulting special architecture is superior, and can we find better? Using LISTA for sparse recovery as a representative example, we conduct the first thorough design space study for the unrolled models. Among all possible variations, we focus on extensively varying the connectivity patterns and neuron types, leading to a gigantic design space arising from LISTA. To efficiently explore this space and identify top performers, we leverage the emerging tool of neural architecture search (NAS). We carefully examine the searched top architectures in a number of settings, and are able to discover networks that are consistently better than LISTA. We further present more visualization and analysis to \"open the black box\", and find that the searched top architectures demonstrate highly consistent and potentially transferable patterns. We hope our study to spark more reflections and explorations on how to better mingle model-based optimization prior and data-driven learning",

While understanding temporal information can improve recognition accuracy for dynamic actions, removing temporal redundancy and reusing past features can significantly save computation leading to efficient action recognition. In this paper, we introduce an adaptive temporal fusion network, called AdaFuse, that dynamically fuses channels from current and past feature maps for strong temporal modelling. Specifically, the necessary information from the historical convolution feature maps is fused with current pruned feature maps with the goal of improving both recognition accuracy and efficiency. In addition, we use a skipping operation to further reduce the computation cost of action recognition. Extensive experiments on Something V1&V2, Jester and Mini-Kinetics show that our approach can achieve about 40% computation savings with comparable accuracy to state-of-the-art methods.

Real Time Recurrent Learning (RTRL) eliminates the need for history storage and allows for online weight updates, but does so at the expense of computational costs that are quartic in the state size. This renders RTRL training intractable for all but the smallest networks, even ones that are made highly sparse. We introduce the Sparse n-step Approximation (SnAp) to the RTRL influence matrix. SnAp only tracks the influence of a parameter on hidden units that are reached by the computation graph within n timesteps of the recurrent core. SnAp with n = 1 is no more expensive than backpropagation but allows training on arbitrarily long sequences. We find that it substantially outperforms other RTRL approximations with comparable costs such as Unbiased Online Recurrent Optimization. For highly sparse networks, SnAp with n = 2 remains tractable and can outperform backpropagation through time in terms of learning speed when updates are done online",

Our techniques revisit the classic idea of logit adjustment based on the label frequencies, either applied post-hoc to a trained model, or enforced in the loss during training.

In this paper, we show that in certain settings, overparameterised models' performance on under-represented subgroups may be improved via post-hoc processing. Specifically, such models' bias can be restricted to their classification layers, and manifest as structured prediction shifts for rare subgroups. We detail two post-hoc correction techniques to mitigate this bias, which operate purely on the outputs of standard model training. We empirically verify that with such post-hoc correction, overparameterisation can improve average and worst-case performance",

The observer is completely agnostic about any particular task being solved; it cares only about measurement locations and their values. This perspective leads to a machine learning framework in which seemingly unrelated tasks can be solved by a single model, by embedding their input and output variables into a shared space. An implementation of the framework is developed in which these variable embeddings are learned jointly with internal model parameters. In experiments, the approach is shown to (1) recover intuitive locations of variables in space and time, (2) exploit regularities across related datasets with completely disjoint input and output spaces, and (3) exploit regularities across seemingly unrelated tasks, outperforming task-specific single-task models and multi-task learning alternatives. The results suggest that even seemingly unrelated tasks may originate from similar underlying processes, a fact that the traveling observer model can use to make better predictions",

    "abstract": "We address the problem of learning on large sets of features, motivated by the need of performing pooling operations in long biological sequences of varying sizes, with long-range dependencies, and possibly few labeled data. To address this challenging task, we introduce a parametrized embedding that aggregates the features from a given set according to the optimal transport plan between the set and a trainable reference. Our approach scales to large datasets and allows end-to-end training of the reference, while also providing a simple unsupervised learning mechanism with small computational cost. Our aggregation technique admits two useful interpretations: it may be seen as a mechanism related to attention layers in neural networks, yet that requires less data, or it may be seen as a scalable surrogate of a classical optimal transport-based kernel. We experimentally demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on biological sequences, achieving state-of-the-art results for protein fold recognition and detection of chromatin profiles tasks, and, as a proof of concept, we show promising results for processing natural language sequences.

    "abstract": "Distributionally robust optimization (DRO) provides a framework for training machine learning models that are able to perform well on a collection of related data distributions (the \"uncertainty set\"). This is done by solving a min-max game: the model is trained to minimize its maximum expected loss among all distributions in the uncertainty set. While careful design of the uncertainty set is critical to the success of the DRO procedure, previous work has been limited to relatively simple alternatives that keep the min-max optimization problem exactly tractable, such as f -divergence balls. In this paper, we argue instead for the use of neural generative models to characterize the worst-case distribution, allowing for more flexible and problem-specific selection of the uncertainty set. However, while simple conceptually, this approach poses a number of implementation and optimization challenges. To circumvent these issues, we propose a relaxation of the KL-constrained inner maximization objective that makes the DRO problem more amenable to gradient-based optimization of large scale generative models, and develop model selection heuristics to guide hyper-parameter search. On both toy settings and realistic NLP tasks, we find that the proposed approach yields models that are more robust than comparable baselines1",

We introduce a novel neural network for building image generators (decoders) and apply it to variational autoencoders (VAEs). In our spatial dependency networks (SDNs), feature maps at each level of a deep neural net are computed in a spatially coherent way, using a sequential gating-based mechanism that distributes contextual information across 2-D space. We show that augmenting the decoder of a hierarchical VAE by spatial dependency layers considerably improves density estimation over baseline convolutional architectures and the state-of-the-art among the models within the same class. Furthermore, we demonstrate that SDN can be applied to large images by synthesizing samples of high quality and coherence. In a vanilla VAE setting, we find that a powerful SDN decoder also improves learning disentangled representations, indicating that neural architectures play an important role in this task. Our results suggest favoring spatial dependency over convolutional layers in various VAE settings. The accompanying source code is given at: https://github.com/djordjemila/sdn",

The main difference is in the training regimes, where continual learning can only have access to one task at a time, which for neural networks typically leads to catastrophic forgetting. That is, the solution found for a subsequent task does not perform well on the previous ones anymore. However, the relationship between the different minima that the two training regimes arrive at is not well understood. What sets them apart? Is there a local structure that could explain the difference in performance achieved by the two different schemes? Motivated by recent work showing that different minima of the same task are typically connected by very simple curves of low error, we investigate whether multitask and continual solutions are similarly connected. We empirically find that indeed such connectivity can be reliably achieved and, more interestingly, it can be done by a linear path, conditioned on having the same initialization for both. We thoroughly analyze this observation and discuss its significance for the continual learning process. Furthermore, we exploit this finding to propose an effective algorithm that constrains the sequentially learned minima to behave as the multitask solution.

Further, using causality we generalize contrastive learning, a particular kind of self-supervised method, and provide an alternative theoretical explanation for the success of these methods.

In this work we propose to move uncertainty from the weights (which are deterministic) to the activation function. Specifically, the activations are modelled with simple 1D Gaussian Processes (GP), for which a triangular kernel inspired by the ReLu non-linearity is explored. Our experiments show that activation-level stochasticity provides more reliable uncertainty estimates than BNN and fBNN, whereas it performs competitively in standard prediction tasks. We also study the connection with deep GPs, both theoretically and empirically.

Despite the strong empirical performance of fine-tuned models, fine-tuning is an unstable process: training the same model with multiple random seeds can result in a large variance of the task performance. Previous literature (Devlin et al., 2019; Lee et al., 2020; Dodge et al., 2020) identified two potential reasons for the observed instability: catastrophic forgetting and a small size of the fine-tuning datasets. In this paper, we show that both hypotheses fail to explain the fine-tuning instability. We analyze BERT, RoBERTa, and ALBERT, fine-tuned on three commonly used datasets from the GLUE benchmark and show that the observed instability is caused by optimization difficulties that lead to vanishing gradients. Additionally, we show that the remaining variance of the downstream task performance can be attributed to differences in generalization where fine-tuned models with the same training loss exhibit noticeably different test performance. Based on our analysis, we present a simple but strong baseline that makes fine-tuning BERT-based models significantly more stable than previously proposed approaches.

To reduce the need for labeled data, we propose to learn simultaneously keypoint heatmaps and pose invariant keypoint representations in a semi-supervised manner using a small set of labeled images along with a larger set of unlabeled images. Keypoint representations are learnt with a semantic keypoint consistency constraint that forces the keypoint detection network to learn similar features for the same keypoint across the dataset. Pose invariance is achieved by making keypoint representations for the image and its augmented copies closer together in feature space.

In order to endow neural networks with the ability to extrapolate over group transformations, we introduce a learning framework counterfactually-guided by the learning hypothesis that any group invariance to (known) transformation groups is mandatory even without evidence, unless the learner deems it inconsistent with the training data.

    "title": "Does enhanced shape bias improve neural network robustness to common corruptions?",
    "abstract": "Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) learn to extract representations of complex features, such as object shapes and textures to solve image recognition tasks. Recent work indicates that CNNs trained on ImageNet are biased towards features that encode textures and that these alone are sufficient to generalize to unseen test data from the same distribution as the training data but often fail to generalize to out-of-distribution data. It has been shown that augmenting the training data with different image styles decreases this texture bias in favor of increased shape bias while at the same time improving robustness to common corruptions, such as noise and blur. Commonly, this is interpreted as shape bias increasing corruption robustness. However, this relationship is only hypothesized. We perform a systematic study of different ways of composing inputs based on natural images, explicit edge information, and stylization. While stylization is essential for achieving high corruption robustness, we do not find a clear correlation between shape bias and robustness. We conclude that the data augmentation caused by style-variation accounts for the improved corruption robustness and increased shape bias is only a byproduct",

Current solutions require precise 3D labels which are labor-intensive to gather, and infeasible to create for many systems such as deformable solids or cloth. We present ∇Sim, a framework that overcomes the dependence on 3D supervision by leveraging differentiable multiphysics simulation and differentiable rendering to jointly model the evolution of scene dynamics and image formation. This novel combination enables backpropagation from pixels in a video sequence through to the underlying physical attributes that generated them. Moreover, our unified computation graph – spanning from the dynamics and through the rendering process – enables learning in challenging visuomotor control tasks, without relying on state-based (3D) supervision, while obtaining performance competitive to or better than techniques that rely on precise 3D labels",

Despite recent advances in this field, current algorithms suffer from three major challenges: high sample complexity, learning only a single way of reaching the goals, and difficulties in solving complex motion planning tasks. In order to address these limitations, we introduce the concept of cumulative accessibility functions, which measure the reachability of a goal from a given state within a specified horizon. We show that these functions obey a recurrence relation, which enables learning from offline interactions. We also prove that optimal cumulative accessibility functions are monotonic in the planning horizon. Additionally, our method can trade off speed and reliability in goal-reaching by suggesting multiple paths to a single goal depending on the provided horizon. We evaluate our approach on a set of multi-goal discrete and continuous control tasks.

In this work, we study whether the double-descent phenomenon can be avoided by using optimal regularization. Theoretically, we prove that for certain linear regression models with isotropic data distribution, optimally-tuned $\\ell_2$ regularization achieves monotonic test performance as we grow either the sample size or the model size.

    "abstract": "Recent research has proposed neural architectures for solving combinatorial problems in structured output spaces. In many such problems, there may exist multiple solutions for a given input, e.g. a partially filled Sudoku puzzle may have many completions satisfying all constraints. Further, we are often interested in finding {\\em any one} of the possible solutions, without any preference between them. Existing approaches completely ignore this solution multiplicity. In this paper, we argue that being oblivious to the presence of multiple solutions can severely hamper their training ability. Our contribution is two fold. First, we formally define the task of learning one-of-many solutions for combinatorial problems in structured output spaces, which is applicable for solving several problems of interest such as N-Queens, and Sudoku. Second, we present a generic learning framework that adapts an existing prediction network for a combinatorial problem to handle solution multiplicity. Our framework uses a selection module, whose goal is to dynamically determine, for every input, the solution that is most effective for training the network parameters in any given learning iteration. We propose an RL based approach to jointly train the selection module with the prediction network. Experiments on three different domains, and using two different prediction networks, demonstrate that our framework significantly improves the accuracy in our setting, obtaining up to $21$ pt gain over the baselines",

    "abstract": "Multi-objective optimization problems are prevalent in machine learning. These problems have a set of optimal solutions, called the Pareto front, where each point on the front represents a different trade-off between possibly conflicting objectives. Recent optimization algorithms can target a specific desired ray in loss space, but still face two grave limitations: (i) A separate model has to be trained for each point on the front; and (ii) The exact trade-off must be known prior to the optimization process. Here, we tackle the problem of learning the entire Pareto front, with the capability of selecting a desired operating point on the front after training. We call this new setup Pareto-Front Learning (PFL).   We describe an approach to PFL implemented using HyperNetworks, which we term Pareto HyperNetworks (PHNs). PHN learns the entire Pareto front simultaneously using a single hypernetwork, which receives as input a desired preference vector and returns a Pareto-optimal model whose loss vector is in the desired ray. The unified model is runtime efficient compared to training multiple models, and generalizes to new operating points not used during training. We evaluate our method on a wide set of problems, from multi-task regression and classification to fairness. PHNs learns the entire Pareto front in roughly the same time as learning a single point on the front, and also reaches a better solution set. PFL opens the door to new applications where models are selected based on preferences that are only available at run time",

    "abstract": "By learning to predict trajectories of dynamical systems, model-based methods can make extensive use of all observations from past experience. However, due to partial observability, stochasticity, compounding errors, and irrelevant dynamics, training to predict observations explicitly often results in poor models. Model-free techniques try to side-step the problem by learning to predict values directly. While breaking the explicit dependency on future observations can result in strong performance, this usually comes at the cost of low sample efficiency, as the abundant information about the dynamics contained in future observations goes unused. Here we take a step back from both approaches: Instead of hand-designing how trajectories should be incorporated, a teacher network learns to extract relevant information from the trajectories and to distill it into target activations which guide a student model that can only observe the present. The teacher is trained with meta-gradients to maximize the student's performance on a validation set. Our approach performs well on tasks that are difficult for model-free and model-based methods, and we study the role of every component through ablation studies",

We propose Private post-GAN boosting (Private PGB), a differentially private method that combines samples produced by the sequence of generators obtained during GAN training to create a high-quality synthetic dataset. Our method leverages the Private Multiplicative Weights method (Hardt and Rothblum, 2010) and the discriminator rejection sampling technique (Azadi et al., 2019) for reweighting generated samples, to obtain high quality synthetic data even in cases where GAN training does not converge. We evaluate Private PGB on a Gaussian mixture dataset and two US Census datasets, and demonstrate that Private PGB improves upon the standard private GAN approach across a collection of quality measures. Finally, we provide a non-private variant of PGB that improves the data quality of standard GAN training",

    "abstract": "This paper targets at visual counting, where the setup is to estimate the total number of occurrences in a natural image given an input query (e.g. a question or a category). Most existing work for counting focuses on explicit, symbolic models that iteratively examine relevant regions to arrive at the final number, mimicking the intuitive process specifically for counting. However, such models can be computationally expensive, and more importantly place a limit on their generalization to other reasoning tasks. In this paper, we propose a simple and effective alternative for visual counting by revisiting modulated convolutions that fuse query and image locally. The modulation is performed on a per-bottleneck basis by fusing query representations with input convolutional feature maps of that residual bottleneck. Therefore, we call our method MoVie, short for Modulated conVolutional bottleneck. Notably, MoVie reasons implicitly and holistically for counting and only needs a single forward-pass during inference. Nevertheless, MoVie showcases strong empirical performance. First, it significantly advances the state-of-the-art accuracies on multiple counting-specific Visual Question Answering (VQA) datasets (i.e., HowMany-QA and TallyQA). Moreover, it also works on common object counting, outperforming prior-art on difficult benchmarks like COCO. Third, integrated as a module, MoVie can be used to improve number-related questions for generic VQA models. Finally, we find MoVie achieves similar, near-perfect results on CLEVR and competitive ones on GQA, suggesting modulated convolutions as a mechanism can be useful for more general reasoning tasks beyond counting",

However, these distances still have their weakness, SWD requires a lot of projection samples because it uses the uniform distribution to sample projecting directions, Max-SWD uses only one projection, causing it to lose a large amount of information. In this paper, we propose a novel distance that finds optimal penalized probability measure over the slices, which is named Distributional Sliced-Wasserstein distance (DSWD). We show that the DSWD is a generalization of both SWD and Max-SWD, and the proposed distance could be found by searching for the push-forward measure over a set of measures satisfying some certain constraints. Moreover, similar to SWD, we can extend Generalized Sliced-Wasserstein distance (GSWD) to Distributional Generalized Sliced-Wasserstein distance (DGSWD). Finally, we carry out extensive experiments to demonstrate the favorable generative modeling performances of our distances over the previous sliced-based distances in large-scale real datasets",

A recent attempt to reduce the inner discrepancy between the prior and aggregated posterior distributions is to incorporate sliced fused Gromov-Wasserstein (SFG) between these distributions. That approach has a weakness since it treats every slicing direction similarly, meanwhile several directions are not useful for the discriminative task. To improve the discrepancy and consequently the relational regularization, we propose a new relational discrepancy, named spherical sliced fused Gromov Wasserstein (SSFG), that can find an important area of projections characterized by a von Mises-Fisher distribution. Then, we introduce two variants of SSFG to improve its performance. The first variant, named mixture spherical sliced fused Gromov Wasserstein (MSSFG), replaces the vMF distribution by a mixture of von Mises-Fisher distributions to capture multiple important areas of directions that are far from each other. The second variant, named power spherical sliced fused Gromov Wasserstein (PSSFG), replaces the vMF distribution by a power spherical distribution to improve the sampling time in high dimension settings. We then apply the new discrepancies to the RAE framework to achieve its new variants. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments to show that the new proposed autoencoders have favorable performance in learning latent manifold structure, image generation, and reconstruction",

This simple property of neural network design has resulted in highly effective architectures for a variety of tasks. Nevertheless, there is limited understanding of effects of depth and width on the learned representations. In this paper, we study this fundamental question. We begin by investigating how varying depth and width affects model hidden representations, finding a characteristic block structure in the hidden representations of larger capacity (wider or deeper) models. We demonstrate that this block structure arises when model capacity is large relative to the size of the training set, and is indicative of the underlying layers preserving and propagating the dominant principal component of their representations. This discovery has important ramifications for features learned by different models, namely, representations outside the block structure are often similar across architectures with varying widths and depths, but the block structure is unique to each model. We analyze the output predictions of different model architectures, finding that even when the overall accuracy is similar, wide and deep models exhibit distinctive error patterns and variations across classes",

The proposed backdoor outperforms the previous methods in a human inspection test by a wide margin, proving its stealthiness. To make such models undetectable by machine defenders, we propose a novel training mode, called the \"noise\" mode. The trained networks successfully attack and bypass the state of the art defense methods on standard classification datasets, including MNIST, CIFAR-10, GTSRB, and CelebA.

Second, time-series are often composed of a sparse set of measurements that could be explained by many possible underlying dynamics. NODEs do not capture this uncertainty. In contrast, Neural Processes (NPs) are a new class of stochastic processes providing uncertainty estimation and fast data-adaptation, but lack an explicit treatment of the flow of time. To address these problems, we introduce Neural ODE Processes (NDPs), a new class of stochastic processes determined by a distribution over Neural ODEs.

We take inspiration from the technique of abstract interpretation, in which an approximate execution model is used to determine if an unfinished program will eventually satisfy a goal specification. Here we learn an approximate execution model implemented as a modular neural network. By constructing compositional program representations that implicitly encode the interpretation semantics of the underlying programming language, we can represent partial programs using a flexible combination of concrete execution state and learned neural representations, using the learned approximate semantics when concrete semantics are not known (in unfinished parts of the program). We show that these hybrid neuro-symbolic representations enable execution-guided synthesizers to use more powerful language constructs, such as loops and higher-order functions, and can be used to synthesize programs more accurately for a given search budget than pure neural approaches in several domains",

    "abstract": "Program synthesis is challenging largely because of the difficulty of search in a large space of programs. Human programmers routinely tackle the task of writing complex programs by writing sub-programs and then analysing their intermediate results to compose them in appropriate ways. Motivated by this intuition, we present a new synthesis approach that leverages learning to guide a bottom-up search over programs. In particular, we train a model to prioritize compositions of intermediate values during search conditioned on a given set of input-output examples. This is a powerful combination because of several emergent properties: First, in bottom-up search, intermediate programs can be executed, providing semantic information to the neural network. Second, given the concrete values from those executions, we can exploit rich features based on recent work on property signatures. Finally, bottom-up search allows the system substantial flexibility in what order to generate the solution, allowing the synthesizer to build up a program from multiple smaller sub-programs. Overall, our empirical evaluation finds that the combination of learning and bottom-up search is remarkably effective, even with simple supervised learning approaches. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our technique on a new data set for synthesis of string transformation programs",

    "title": "Learning to Sample with Local and Global Contexts in Experience Replay Buffer",
    "abstract": "Experience replay, which enables the agents to remember and reuse experience from the past, plays a significant role in the success of off-policy reinforcement learning (RL). To utilize the experience replay efficiently, experience transitions should be sampled with consideration of their significance, such that the known prioritized experience replay (PER) further allows to sample more important experience. Yet, the conventional PER may result in generating highly biased samples due to considering a single metric such as TD-error and computing the sampling rate independently for each experience. To tackle this issue, we propose a Neural Experience Replay Sampler (NERS), which adaptively evaluates the relative importance of a sampled transition by obtaining context from not only its (local) values that characterize itself such as TD-error or the raw features but also other (global) transitions. We validate our framework on multiple benchmark tasks for both continuous and discrete controls and show that the proposed framework significantly improves the performance of various off-policy RL methods. Further analysis confirms that the improvements indeed come from the use of diverse features and the consideration of the relative importance of experiences",

    "abstract": "We consider the novel task of learning disentangled representations of object shape and appearance across multiple domains (e.g., dogs and cars). The goal is to learn a generative model that learns an intermediate distribution, which borrows a subset of properties from each domain, enabling the generation of images that did not exist in any domain exclusively. This challenging problem requires an accurate disentanglement of object shape, appearance, and background from each domain, so that the appearance and shape factors from the two domains can be interchanged. We augment an existing approach that can disentangle factors within a single domain but struggles to do so across domains. Our key technical contribution is to represent object appearance with a differentiable histogram of visual features, and to optimize the generator so that two images with the same latent appearance factor but different latent shape factors produce similar histograms. On multiple multi-domain datasets, we demonstrate our method leads to accurate and consistent appearance and shape transfer across domains",

The AD techniques underlying these tools were designed to compute exact gradients to numerical precision, but modern machine learning models are almost always trained with stochastic gradient descent. Why spend computation and memory on exact (minibatch) gradients only to use them for stochastic optimization? We develop a general framework and approach for randomized automatic differentiation (RAD), which allows unbiased gradient estimates to be computed with reduced memory in return for variance. We examine limitations of the general approach, and argue that we must leverage problem specific structure to realize benefits. We develop RAD techniques for a variety of simple neural network architectures, and show that for a fixed memory budget, RAD converges in fewer iterations than using a small batch size for feedforward networks, and in a similar number for recurrent networks. We also show that RAD can be applied to scientific computing, and use it to develop a low-memory stochastic gradient method for optimizing the control parameters of a linear reaction-diffusion PDE representing a fission reactor",

To avoid incurring increased computational costs, we investigate a family of low-dimensional late-phase weight models which interact multiplicatively with the remaining parameters. Our results show that augmenting standard models with late-phase weights improves generalization in established benchmarks such as CIFAR-10/100, ImageNet and enwik8. These findings are complemented with a theoretical analysis of a noisy quadratic problem which provides a simplified picture of the late phases of neural network learning",

    "title": "ResNet After All: Neural ODEs and Their Numerical Solution",
    "abstract": "A key appeal of the recently proposed Neural Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) framework is that it seems to provide a continuous-time extension of discrete residual neural networks. As we show herein, though, trained Neural ODE models actually depend on the specific numerical method used during training. If the trained model is supposed to be a flow generated from an ODE, it should be possible to choose another numerical solver with equal or smaller numerical error without loss of performance. We observe that if training relies on a solver with overly coarse discretization, then testing with another solver of equal or smaller numerical error results in a sharp drop in accuracy. In such cases, the combination of vector field and numerical method cannot be interpreted as a flow generated from an ODE, which arguably poses a fatal breakdown of the Neural ODE concept. We observe, however, that there exists a critical step size beyond which the training yields a valid ODE vector field. We propose a method that monitors the behavior of the ODE solver during training to adapt its step size, aiming to ensure a valid ODE without unnecessarily increasing computational cost. We verify this adaptation algorithm on a common bench mark dataset as well as a synthetic dataset",

    "title": "Differentiable Trust Region Layers for Deep Reinforcement Learning",
    "abstract": "Trust region methods are a popular tool in reinforcement learning as they yield robust policy updates in continuous and discrete action spaces. However, enforcing such trust regions in deep reinforcement learning is difficult. Hence, many approaches, such as Trust Region Policy Optimization (TRPO) and Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), are based on approximations. Due to those approximations, they violate the constraints or fail to find the optimal solution within the trust region. Moreover, they are difficult to implement, lack sufficient exploration, and have been shown to depend on seemingly unrelated implementation choices. In this work, we propose differentiable neural network layers to enforce trust regions for deep Gaussian policies via closed-form projections. Unlike existing methods, those layers formalize trust regions for each state individually and can complement existing reinforcement learning algorithms. We derive trust region projections based on the Kullback-Leibler divergence, the Wasserstein L2 distance, and the Frobenius norm for Gaussian distributions. We empirically demonstrate that those projection layers achieve similar or better results than existing methods while being almost agnostic to specific implementation choices.

    "abstract": "Adiabatic quantum computation is a form of computation that acts by slowly interpolating a quantum system between an easy to prepare initial state and a final state that represents a solution to a given computational problem. The choice of the interpolation schedule is critical to the performance: if at a certain time point, the evolution is too rapid, the system has a high probability to transfer to a higher energy state, which does not represent a solution to the problem. On the other hand, an evolution that is too slow leads to a loss of computation time and increases the probability of failure due to decoherence. In this work, we train deep neural models to produce optimal schedules that are conditioned on the problem at hand. We consider two types of problem representation: the Hamiltonian form, and the Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) form. A novel loss function that scores schedules according to their approximated success probability is introduced. We benchmark our approach on random QUBO problems, Grover search, 3-SAT, and MAX-CUT problems and show that our approach outperforms, by a sizable margin, the linear schedules as well as alternative approaches that were very recently proposed",

    "abstract": "While graph neural networks have made impressive progress in classification and regression, few approaches to date perform time series prediction on graphs, and those that do are mostly limited to edge changes. We suggest that graph edits are a more natural interface for graph-to-graph learning. In particular, graph edits are general enough to describe any graph-to-graph change, not only edge changes; they are sparse, making them easier to understand for humans and more efficient computationally; and they are local, avoiding the need for pooling layers in graph neural networks. In this paper, we propose a novel output layer the graph edit network which takes node embeddings as input and generates a sequence of graph edits that transform the input graph to the output graph. We prove that a mapping between the node sets of two graphs is sufficient to construct training data for a graph edit network and that an optimal mapping yields edit scripts that are almost as short as the graph edit distance between the graphs. We further provide a proof-of-concept empirical evaluation on several graph dynamical systems, which are difficult to learn for baselines from the literature",

    "title": "Estimating Lipschitz constants of monotone deep equilibrium models",
    "abstract": "Several methods have been proposed in recent years to provide bounds on the Lipschitz constants of deep networks, which can be used to provide robustness guarantees, generalization bounds, and characterize the smoothness of decision boundaries. However, existing bounds get substantially weaker with increasing depth of the network, which makes it unclear how to apply such bounds to recently proposed models such as the deep equilibrium (DEQ) model, which can be viewed as representing an infinitely-deep network. In this paper, we show that monotone DEQs, a recently-proposed subclass of DEQs, have Lipschitz constants that can be bounded as a simple function of the strong monotonicity parameter of the network. We derive simple-yet-tight bounds on both the input-output mapping and the weight-output mapping defined by these networks, and demonstrate that they are small relative to those for comparable standard DNNs. We show that one can use these bounds to design monotone DEQ models, even with e.g. multi-scale convolutional structure, that still have constraints on the Lipschitz constant. We also highlight how to use these bounds to develop PAC-Bayes generalization bounds that do not depend on any depth of the network, and which avoid the exponential depth-dependence of comparable DNN bounds",

In this paper, we provide empirical evidence that suggests that -- instead of hard-coding road rules into self-driving algorithms -- a scalable alternative may be to design multi-agent environments in which road rules emerge as optimal solutions to the problem of maximizing traffic flow. We analyze what ingredients in driving environments cause the emergence of these road rules and find that two crucial factors are noisy perception and agents' spatial density. We provide qualitative and quantitative evidence of the emergence of seven social driving behaviors, ranging from obeying traffic signals to following lanes, all of which emerge from training agents to drive quickly to destinations without colliding. Our results add empirical support for the social road rules that countries worldwide have agreed on for safe, efficient driving",

    "title": "Fuzzy Tiling Activations: A Simple Approach to Learning Sparse Representations Online",
    "abstract": "Interference is a known problem when learning in online settings, such as continual learning or reinforcement learning. Interference occurs when updates, to improve performance for some inputs, degrades performance for others. Recent work has shown that sparse representations---where only a small percentage of units are active---can significantly reduce interference. Those works, however, relied on relatively complex regularization or meta-learning approaches, that have only been used offline in a pre-training phase. In our approach, we design an activation function that naturally produces sparse representations, and so is much more amenable to online training. The idea relies on the simple approach of binning, but overcomes the two key limitations of binning: zero gradients for the flat regions almost everywhere, and lost precision---reduced discrimination---due to coarse aggregation. We introduce a Leaky Tiling Activation (LTA) that provides non-negligible gradients and produces overlap between bins that improves discrimination. We empirically investigate both value-based and policy gradient reinforcement learning algorithms that use neural networks with LTAs, in classic discrete-action control environments and Mujoco continuous-action environments. We show that, with LTAs, learning is faster, with more stable policies, without needing target networks",

Furthermore, spatio-temporal graph neural networks lack theoretical interpretation. To address these issues, we put forth a novel mathematically designed framework to analyze spatio-temporal data. Our proposed spatio-temporal graph scattering transform (ST-GST) extends traditional scattering transforms to the spatio-temporal domain. It performs iterative applications of spatio-temporal graph wavelets and nonlinear activation functions, which can be viewed as a forward pass of spatio-temporal graph convolutional networks without training. Since all the filter coefficients in ST-GST are mathematically designed, it is promising for the real-world scenarios with limited training data, and also allows for a theoretical analysis, which shows that the proposed ST-GST is stable to small perturbations of input signals and structures. Finally, our experiments show that i) ST-GST outperforms spatio-temporal graph convolutional networks by an increase of 35% in accuracy for MSR Action3D dataset; ii) it is better and computationally more efficient to design the transform based on separable spatio-temporal graphs than the joint ones; and iii) the nonlinearity in ST-GST is critical to empirical performance",

While state-of-the-art 2D generative models like GANs show unprecedented quality in modeling the natural image manifold, it is unclear whether they implicitly capture the underlying 3D object structures. And if so, how could we exploit such knowledge to recover the 3D shapes of objects in the images? To answer these questions, in this work, we present the first attempt to directly mine 3D geometric clues from an off-the-shelf 2D GAN that is trained on RGB images only. Through our investigation, we found that such a pre-trained GAN indeed contains rich 3D knowledge and thus can be used to recover 3D shape from a single 2D image in an unsupervised manner. The core of our framework is an iterative strategy that explores and exploits diverse viewpoint and lighting variations in the GAN image manifold. The framework does not require 2D keypoint or 3D annotations, or strong assumptions on object shapes (e.g. shapes are symmetric), yet it successfully recovers 3D shapes with high precision for human faces, cats, cars, and buildings. The recovered 3D shapes immediately allow high-quality image editing like relighting and object rotation. We quantitatively demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach compared to previous methods in both 3D shape reconstruction and face rotation.

    "title": "VA-RED2: Video Adaptive Redundancy Reduction",
    "abstract": "Performing inference on deep learning models for videos remains a challenge due to the large amount of computational resources required to achieve robust recognition. An inherent property of real-world videos is the high correlation of information across frames which can translate into redundancy in either temporal or spatial feature maps of the models, or both. The type of redundant features depends on the dynamics and type of events in the video: static videos have more temporal redundancy while videos focusing on objects tend to have more channel redundancy. Here we present a redundancy reduction framework, termed VA-RED, which is input-dependent. Specifically, our VA-RED framework uses an input-dependent policy to decide how many features need to be computed for temporal and channel dimensions. To keep the capacity of the original model, after fully computing the necessary features, we reconstruct the remaining redundant features from those using cheap linear operations. We learn the adaptive policy jointly with the network weights in a differentiable way with a shared-weight mechanism, making it highly efficient. Extensive experiments on multiple video datasets and different visual tasks show that our framework achieves 20% − 40% reduction in computation (FLOPs) when compared to state-of-the-art methods without any performance loss.

Surprisingly, we find that the basic training settings (e.g., weight decay, learning rate schedule, etc.) used in these methods are highly inconsistent, which could largely affect the model performance as shown in our experiments. For example, a slightly different value of weight decay can reduce the model robust accuracy by more than 7%, which is probable to override the potential promotion induced by the proposed methods.

To inspect this, we first formalize a notion of consistency for minima of the loss surface, which measures to what extent a minimum appears only when examples are pooled. We then propose and experimentally validate a simple alternative algorithm based on a logical AND, that focuses on invariances and prevents memorization in a set of real-world tasks.

Similarly, in many distributed RL settings, acting is done on unaccelerated hardware such as CPUs, which likewise restricts model size to prevent intractable experiment run times. These \"actor-latency\" constrained settings present a major obstruction to the scaling up of model complexity that has recently been extremely successful in supervised learning. To be able to utilize large model capacity while still operating within the limits imposed by the system during acting, we develop an \"Actor-Learner Distillation\" (ALD) procedure that leverages a continual form of distillation that transfers learning progress from a large capacity learner model to a small capacity actor model. As a case study, we develop this procedure in the context of partially-observable environments, where transformer models have had large improvements over LSTMs recently, at the cost of significantly higher computational complexity. With transformer models as the learner and LSTMs as the actor, we demonstrate in several challenging memory environments that using Actor-Learner Distillation recovers the clear sample-efficiency gains of the transformer learner model while maintaining the fast inference and reduced total training time of the LSTM actor model",

    "title": "Multi-Class Uncertainty Calibration via Mutual Information Maximization-based Binning",
    "abstract": "Post-hoc calibration is a common approach for providing high-quality confidence estimates of deep neural network predictions. Recent work has shown that widely used scaling methods underestimate their calibration error, while alternative Histogram Binning (HB) methods with verifiable calibration performance often fail to preserve classification accuracy. In the case of multi-class calibration with a large number of classes K, HB also faces the issue of severe sample-inefficiency due to a large class imbalance resulting from the conversion into K one-vs-rest class-wise calibration problems. The goal of this paper is to resolve the identified issues of HB in order to provide verified and calibrated confidence estimates using only a small holdout calibration dataset for bin optimization while preserving multi-class ranking accuracy. From an information-theoretic perspective, we derive the I-Max concept for binning, which maximizes the mutual information between labels and binned (quantized) logits. This concept mitigates potential loss in ranking performance due to lossy quantization, and by disentangling the optimization of bin edges and representatives allows simultaneous improvement of ranking and calibration performance. In addition, we propose a shared class-wise (sCW) binning strategy that fits a single calibrator on the merged training sets of all K class-wise problems, yielding reliable estimates from a small calibration set. The combination of sCW and I-Max binning outperforms the state of the art calibration methods on various evaluation metrics across different benchmark datasets and models, even when using only a small set of calibration data, e.g. 1k samples for ImageNet",

    "abstract": "The dominant paradigm for learning video-text representations -- noise contrastive learning -- increases the similarity of the representations of pairs of samples that are known to be related, such as text and video from the same sample, and pushes away the representations of all other pairs. We posit that this last behaviour is too strict, enforcing dissimilar representations even for samples that are semantically-related -- for example, visually similar videos or ones that share the same depicted action. In this paper, we propose a novel method that alleviates this by leveraging a generative model to naturally push these related samples together: each sample's caption must be reconstructed as a weighted combination of other support samples' visual representations. This simple idea ensures that representations are not overly-specialized to individual samples, are reusable across the dataset, and results in representations that explicitly encode semantics shared between samples, unlike noise contrastive learning. Our proposed method outperforms others by a large margin on MSR-VTT, VATEX and ActivityNet, for video-to-text and text-to-video retrieval",

    "title": "Rao-Blackwellizing the Straight-Through Gumbel-Softmax Gradient Estimator",
    "abstract": "Gradient estimation in models with discrete latent variables is a challenging problem, because the simplest unbiased estimators tend to have high variance. To counteract this, modern estimators either introduce bias, rely on multiple function evaluations, or use learned, input-dependent baselines. Thus, there is a need for estimators that require minimal tuning, are computationally cheap, and have low mean squared error. In this paper, we show that the variance of the straight-through variant of the popular Gumbel-Softmax estimator can be reduced through Rao-Blackwellization without increasing the number of function evaluations. This provably reduces the mean squared error. We empirically demonstrate that this leads to variance reduction, faster convergence, and generally improved performance in two unsupervised latent variable models",

    "abstract": "Transformers are state-of-the-art models for a variety of sequence modeling tasks. At their core is an attention function which models pairwise interactions between the inputs at every timestep. While attention is powerful, it does not scale efficiently to long sequences due to its quadratic time and space complexity in the sequence length. We propose RFA, a linear time and space attention that uses random feature methods to approximate the softmax function, and explore its application in transformers. RFA can be used as a drop-in replacement for conventional softmax attention and offers a straightforward way of learning with recency bias through an optional gating mechanism. Experiments on language modeling and machine translation demonstrate that RFA achieves similar or better performance compared to strong transformer baselines. In the machine translation experiment, RFA decodes twice as fast as a vanilla transformer. Compared to existing efficient transformer variants, RFA is competitive in terms of both accuracy and efficiency on three long text classification datasets. Our analysis shows that RFA's efficiency gains are especially notable on long sequences, suggesting that RFA will be particularly useful in tasks that require working with large inputs, fast decoding speed, or low memory footprints",

This is the problem of $\\textit{symbolic}$ $\\textit{regression.}$ Despite recent advances in training neural networks to solve complex tasks, deep learning approaches to symbolic regression are underexplored. We propose a framework that combines deep learning with symbolic regression via a simple idea: use a large model to search the space of small models. More specifically, we use a recurrent neural network to emit a distribution over tractable mathematical expressions, and employ reinforcement learning to train the network to generate better-fitting expressions. Our algorithm significantly outperforms standard genetic programming-based symbolic regression in its ability to exactly recover symbolic expressions on a series of benchmark problems, both with and without added noise. More broadly, our contributions include a framework that can be applied to optimize hierarchical, variable-length objects under a black-box performance metric, with the ability to incorporate a priori constraints in situ, and a risk-seeking policy gradient formulation that optimizes for best-case performance instead of expected performance",

Mesh representations support powerful numerical integration methods and their resolution can be adapted to strike favorable trade-offs between accuracy and efficiency. However, high-dimensional scientific simulations are very expensive to run, and solvers and parameters must often be tuned individually to each system studied. Here we introduce MeshGraphNets, a framework for learning mesh-based simulations using graph neural networks. Our model can be trained to pass messages on a mesh graph and to adapt the mesh discretization during forward simulation. Our results show it can accurately predict the dynamics of a wide range of physical systems, including aerodynamics, structural mechanics, and cloth. The model's adaptivity supports learning resolution-independent dynamics and can scale to more complex state spaces at test time. Our method is also highly efficient, running 1-2 orders of magnitude faster than the simulation on which it is trained.

    "title": "Global Convergence of Three-layer Neural Networks in the Mean Field Regime",
    "abstract": "In the mean field regime, neural networks are appropriately scaled so that as the width tends to infinity, the learning dynamics tends to a nonlinear and nontrivial dynamical limit, known as the mean field limit. This lends a way to study large-width neural networks via analyzing the mean field limit. Recent works have successfully applied such analysis to two-layer networks and provided global convergence guarantees. The extension to multilayer ones however has been a highly challenging puzzle, and little is known about the optimization efficiency in the mean field regime when there are more than two layers. In this work, we prove a global convergence result for unregularized feedforward three-layer networks in the mean field regime. We first develop a rigorous framework to establish the mean field limit of three-layer networks under stochastic gradient descent training. To that end, we propose the idea of a neuronal embedding, which comprises of a fixed probability space that encapsulates neural networks of arbitrary sizes. The identified mean field limit is then used to prove a global convergence guarantee under suitable regularity and convergence mode assumptions, which – unlike previous works on two-layer networks – does not rely critically on convexity. Underlying the result is a universal approximation property, natural of neural networks, which importantly is shown to hold at any finite training time (not necessarily at convergence) via an algebraic topology argument",

In this paper, we propose a novel method to generate pseudo-parallel data from a pre-trained back-translation model. Our method is a meta-learning algorithm which adapts a pre-trained back-translation model so that the pseudoparallel data it generates would train a forward-translation model to do well on a validation set.

Traditional few-shot and transfer learning techniques fail in the presence of such extreme differences between the source and target tasks. In this paper, we present a simple and effective solution to tackle this extreme domain gap: self-training a source domain representation on unlabeled data from the target domain.

    "title": "Conditionally Adaptive Multi-Task Learning: Improving Transfer Learning in NLP Using Fewer Parameters & Less Data",
    "abstract": "Multi-Task Learning (MTL) has emerged as a promising approach for transferring learned knowledge across different tasks. However, multi-task learning must deal with challenges such as: overfitting to low resource tasks, catastrophic forgetting, and negative task transfer, or learning interference. Additionally, in Natural Language Processing (NLP), MTL alone has typically not reached the performance level possible through per-task fine-tuning of pretrained models. However, many fine-tuning approaches are both parameter inefficient, e.g. potentially involving one new model per task, and highly susceptible to losing knowledge acquired during pretraining. We propose a novel transformer based architecture consisting of a new conditional attention mechanism as well as a set of task conditioned modules that facilitate weight sharing. Through this construction we achieve more efficient parameter sharing and mitigate forgetting by keeping half of the weights of a pretrained model fixed. We also use a new multi-task data sampling strategy to mitigate the negative effects of data imbalance across tasks. Using this approach we are able to surpass single-task fine-tuning methods while being parameter and data efficient. With our base model, we attain 2.2% higher performance compared to a full fine-tuned BERT large model on the GLUE benchmark, adding only 5.6% more trained parameters per task (whereas naive fine-tuning potentially adds 100% of the trained parameters per task) and needing only 64.6% of the data. We show that a larger variant of our single multi-task model approach performs competitively across 26 NLP tasks and yields state-of-the-art results on a number of test and development sets",

We show semi-analytically in simple controlled scenarios that these two measures correlate strongly with each other and with generalization. Then, we extend the analysis to the deep learning scenario by extensive numerical validations. We study two algorithms, entropy-stochastic gradient descent and replicated-stochastic gradient descent, that explicitly include the local entropy in the optimization objective.

However, it remains unclear whether these lower bounds are tight enough to provide a useful approximation for the intrinsic robustness of a dataset. To gain a deeper understanding of the concentration of measure phenomenon, we first extend the Gaussian Isoperimetric Inequality to non-spherical Gaussian measures and arbitrary `p-norms (p ≥ 2). We leverage these theoretical insights to design a method that uses half-spaces to estimate the concentration of any empirical dataset under `p-norm distance metrics. Our proposed algorithm is more efficient than Mahloujifar et al.

    "abstract": "Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have advanced existing medical systems for automatic disease diagnosis. However, a threat to these systems arises that adversarial attacks make CNNs vulnerable. Inaccurate diagnosis results make a negative influence on human healthcare. There is a need to investigate potential adversarial attacks to robustify deep medical diagnosis systems. On the other side, there are several modalities of medical images (e.g., CT, fundus, and endoscopic image) of which each type is significantly different from others. It is more challenging to generate adversarial perturbations for different types of medical images. In this paper, we propose an image-based medical adversarial attack method to consistently produce adversarial perturbations on medical images. The objective function of our method consists of a loss deviation term and a loss stabilization term. The loss deviation term increases the divergence between the CNN prediction of an adversarial example and its ground truth label. Meanwhile, the loss stabilization term ensures similar CNN predictions of this example and its smoothed input. From the perspective of the whole iterations for perturbation generation, the proposed loss stabilization term exhaustively searches the perturbation space to smooth the single spot for local optimum escape. We further analyze the KL-divergence of the proposed loss function and find that the loss stabilization term makes the perturbations updated towards a fixed objective spot while deviating from the ground truth. This stabilization ensures the proposed medical attack effective for different types of medical images while producing perturbations in small variance. Experiments on several medical image analysis benchmarks including the recent COVID-19 dataset show the stability of the proposed method",

In this paper, we aim to leverage the ideas from success stories in visual recognition tasks to build object representations that can capture inter-object and object-environment interactions over a long-range. To this end, we propose Region Proposal Interaction Networks (RPIN), which reason about each object's trajectory in a latent region-proposal feature space.

Existing methods combine hyperprior with local context in the entropy estimation function. This greatly limits their performance due to the absence of a global vision. In this work, we propose a novel Global Reference Model for image compression to effectively leverage both the local and the global context information, leading to an enhanced compression rate. The proposed method scans decoded latents and then finds the most relevant latent to assist the distribution estimating of the current latent. A by-product of this work is the innovation of a mean-shifting GDN module that further improves the performance. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms the rate-distortion performance of most of the state-of-the-art methods in the industry",

    "abstract": "To alleviate the resource constraint for real-time point clouds applications that run on edge devices, we present BiPointNet, the first model binarization approach for efficient deep learning on point clouds. In this work, we discover that the immense performance drop of binarized models for point clouds is caused by two main challenges: aggregation-induced feature homogenization that leads to a degradation of information entropy, and scale distortion that hinders optimization and invalidates scale-sensitive structures. With theoretical justifications and in-depth analysis, we propose Entropy-Maximizing Aggregation(EMA) to modulate the distribution before aggregation for the maximum information entropy, andLayer-wise Scale Recovery(LSR) to efficiently restore feature scales. Extensive experiments show that our BiPointNet outperforms existing binarization methods by convincing margins, at the level even comparable with the full precision counterpart. We highlight that our techniques are generic which show significant improvements on various fundamental tasks and mainstream backbones. BiPoint-Net gives an impressive 14.7 times speedup and 18.9 times storage saving on real-world resource-constrained devices",

    "abstract": "We study the multi-agent safe control problem where agents should avoid collisions to static obstacles and collisions with each other while reaching their goals. Our core idea is to learn the multi-agent control policy jointly with learning the control barrier functions as safety certificates. We propose a novel joint-learning framework that can be implemented in a decentralized fashion, with generalization guarantees for certain function classes. Such a decentralized framework can adapt to an arbitrarily large number of agents. Building upon this framework, we further improve the scalability by incorporating neural network architectures that are invariant to the quantity and permutation of neighboring agents. In addition, we propose a new spontaneous policy refinement method to further enforce the certificate condition during testing. We provide extensive experiments to demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms other leading multi-agent control approaches in terms of maintaining safety and completing original tasks. Our approach also shows exceptional generalization capability in that the control policy can be trained with 8 agents in one scenario, while being used on other scenarios with up to 1024 agents in complex multi-agent environments and dynamics",

    "abstract": "This paper studies learning logic rules for reasoning on knowledge graphs. Logic rules provide interpretable explanations when used for prediction as well as being able to generalize to other tasks, and hence are critical to learn. Existing methods either suffer from the problem of searching in a large search space (e.g., neural logic programming) or ineffective optimization due to sparse rewards (e.g., techniques based on reinforcement learning). To address these limitations, this paper proposes a probabilistic model called RNNLogic. RNNLogic treats logic rules as a latent variable, and simultaneously trains a rule generator as well as a reasoning predictor with logic rules. We develop an EM-based algorithm for optimization. In each iteration, the reasoning predictor is first updated to explore some generated logic rules for reasoning. Then in the E-step, we select a set of high-quality rules from all generated rules with both the rule generator and reasoning predictor via posterior inference; and in the M-step, the rule generator is updated with the rules selected in the E-step. Experiments on four datasets prove the effectiveness of RNNLogic",

However, due to the discrete nature of natural language, designing label-preserving transformations for text data tends to be more challenging. In this paper, we propose a novel data augmentation framework dubbed CoDA, which synthesizes diverse and informative augmented examples by integrating multiple transformations organically. Moreover, a contrastive regularization objective is introduced to capture the global relationship among all the data samples. A momentum encoder along with a memory bank is further leveraged to better estimate the contrastive loss. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed framework, we apply CoDA to Transformer-based models on a wide range of natural language understanding tasks. On the GLUE benchmark, CoDA gives rise to an average improvement of 2.2% while applied to the RoBERTa-large model. More importantly, it consistently exhibits stronger results relative to several competitive data augmentation and adversarial training base-lines (including the low-resource settings). Extensive experiments show that the proposed contrastive objective can be flexibly combined with various data augmentation approaches to further boost their performance, highlighting the wide applicability of the CoDA framework",

While methods that harness spatial and temporal structures find broad application, recent work has demonstrated the potential of models that leverage sparse and modular structure using an ensemble of sparingly interacting modules. In this work, we take a step towards dynamic models that are capable of simultaneously exploiting both modular and spatiotemporal structures. To this end, we model the dynamical system as a collection of autonomous but sparsely interacting sub-systems that interact according to a learned topology which is informed by the spatial structure of the underlying system. This gives rise to a class of models that are well suited for capturing the dynamics of systems that only offer local views into their state, along with corresponding spatial locations of those views. On the tasks of video prediction from cropped frames and multi-agent world modeling from partial observations in the challenging Starcraft2 domain, we find our models to be more robust to the number of available views and capable of better generalization to novel tasks without additional training than strong baselines that perform equally well or better on the training distribution",

While theoretical approaches to the problem have hit some limits, a recent research direction initiated by Duetting et al.

First, we use recent results in theoretical auction design (Rubinstein and Weinberg, 2018) to introduce a time-independent Lagrangian. This not only circumvents the need for an expensive hyper-parameter search (as in prior work), but also provides a principled metric to compare the performance of two auctions (absent from prior work). Second, the optimization procedure in previous work uses an inner maximization loop to compute optimal misreports. We amortize this process through the introduction of an additional neural network. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by learning competitive or strictly improved auctions compared to prior work. Both results together further imply a novel formulation of Auction Design as a two-player game with stationary utility functions",

The theory of complementary learning systems (McClelland et al., 1995) suggests that the compressed representation produced by a serial event (episodic memory) is later restructured to build a more generalized form of reusable knowledge (semantic memory). In this work we develop a new principled Bayesian memory allocation scheme that bridges the gap between episodic and semantic memory via a hierarchical latent variable model. We take inspiration from traditional heap allocation and extend the idea of locally contiguous memory to the Kanerva Machine, enabling a novel differentiable block allocated latent memory. In contrast to the Kanerva Machine, we simplify the process of memory writing by treating it as a fully feed forward deterministic process, relying on the stochasticity of the read key distribution to disperse information within the memory. We demonstrate that this allocation scheme improves performance in memory conditional image generation, resulting in new state-of-the-art conditional likelihood values on binarized MNIST (≤41.58 nats/image) , binarized Omniglot (≤66.24 nats/image), as well as presenting competitive performance on CIFAR10, DMLab Mazes, Celeb-A and ImageNet32×32",

Despite the ubiquity of catastrophic forgetting, there is limited understanding of the underlying process and its causes.

Through representational analysis techniques, we find that deeper layers are disproportionately the source of forgetting. Supporting this, a study of methods to mitigate forgetting illustrates that they act to stabilize deeper layers. These insights enable the development of an analytic argument and empirical picture relating the degree of forgetting to representational similarity between tasks. Consistent with this picture, we observe maximal forgetting occurs for task sequences with intermediate similarity.

Recent approaches regularize predictions to increase diversity; however, they also drastically decrease individual members' performances. In this paper, we argue that learning strategies for deep ensembles need to tackle the trade-off between ensemble diversity and individual accuracies. Motivated by arguments from information theory and leveraging recent advances in neural estimation of conditional mutual information, we introduce a novel training criterion called DICE: it increases diversity by reducing spurious correlations among features. The main idea is that features extracted from pairs of members should only share information useful for target class prediction without being conditionally redundant. Therefore, besides the classification loss with information bottleneck, we adversarially prevent features from being conditionally predictable from each other. We manage to reduce simultaneous errors while protecting class information. We obtain state-of-the-art accuracy results on CIFAR-10/100: for example, an ensemble of 5 networks trained with DICE matches an ensemble of 7 networks trained independently.

    "abstract": "We show that the transformer attention mechanism is the update rule of a modern Hopfield network with continuous states. This new Hopfield network can store exponentially (with the dimension) many patterns, converges with one update, and has exponentially small retrieval errors. The number of stored patterns is traded off against convergence speed and retrieval error. The new Hopfield network has three types of energy minima (fixed points of the update): (1) global fixed point averaging over all patterns, (2) metastable states averaging over a subset of patterns, and (3) fixed points which store a single pattern. Transformer and BERT models operate in their first layers preferably in the global averaging regime, while they operate in higher layers in metastable states. The gradient in transformers is maximal for metastable states, is uniformly distributed for global averaging, and vanishes for a fixed point near a stored pattern. Using the Hopfield network interpretation, we analyzed learning of transformer and BERT models. Learning starts with attention heads that average and then most of them switch to metastable states. However, the majority of heads in the first layers still averages and can be replaced by averaging, e.g. our proposed Gaussian weighting. In contrast, heads in the last layers steadily learn and seem to use metastable states to collect information created in lower layers. These heads seem to be a promising target for improving transformers. Neural networks with Hopfield networks outperform other methods on immune repertoire classification, where the Hopfield net stores several hundreds of thousands of patterns. We provide a new PyTorch layer called \"Hopfield\", which allows to equip deep learning architectures with modern Hopfield networks as a new powerful concept comprising pooling, memory, and attention.

In this work we model the multi-variate temporal dynamics of time series via an autoregressive deep learning model, where the data distribution is represented by a conditioned normalizing flow. This combination retains the power of autoregressive models, such as good performance in extrapolation into the future, with the flexibility of flows as a general purpose high-dimensional distribution model, while remaining computationally tractable.

We argue that PL underperforms due to the erroneous high confidence predictions from poorly calibrated models; these predictions generate many incorrect pseudo-labels, leading to noisy training. We propose an uncertainty-aware pseudo-label selection (UPS) framework which improves pseudo labeling accuracy by drastically reducing the amount of noise encountered in the training process. Furthermore, UPS generalizes the pseudo-labeling process, allowing for the creation of negative pseudo-labels; these negative pseudo-labels can be used for multi-label classification as well as negative learning to improve the single-label classification.

In response, we develop a new family of unsupervised sampling methods for selecting hard negative samples where the user can control the hardness. A limiting case of this sampling results in a representation that tightly clusters each class, and pushes different classes as far apart as possible.

Our batch selection algorithm, which we call FairBatch, implements this optimization and supports prominent fairness measures: equal opportunity, equalized odds, and demographic parity. FairBatch comes with a significant implementation benefit -- it does not require any modification to data preprocessing or model training. For instance, a single-line change of PyTorch code for replacing batch selection part of model training suffices to employ FairBatch. Our experiments conducted both on synthetic and benchmark real data demonstrate that FairBatch can provide such functionalities while achieving comparable (or even greater) performances against the state of the arts.

    "title": "The Risks of Invariant Risk Minimization",
    "abstract": "Invariant Causal Prediction (Peters et al., 2016) is a technique for out-of-distribution generalization which assumes that some aspects of the data distribution vary across the training set but that the underlying causal mechanisms remain constant. Recently, Arjovsky et al. (2019) proposed Invariant Risk Minimization (IRM), an objective based on this idea for learning deep, invariant features of data which are a complex function of latent variables; many alternatives have subsequently been suggested. However, formal guarantees for all of these works are severely lacking. In this paper, we present the first analysis of classification under the IRM objective$-$as well as these recently proposed alternatives$-$under a fairly natural and general model. In the linear case, we show simple conditions under which the optimal solution succeeds or, more often, fails to recover the optimal invariant predictor. We furthermore present the very first results in the non-linear regime: we demonstrate that IRM can fail catastrophically unless the test data are sufficiently similar to the training distribution$-$this is precisely the issue that it was intended to solve. Thus, in this setting we find that IRM and its alternatives fundamentally do not improve over standard Empirical Risk Minimization",

    "title": "Overfitting for Fun and Profit: Instance-Adaptive Data Compression",
    "abstract": "Neural data compression has been shown to outperform classical methods in terms of rate-distortion (RD) performance, with results still improving rapidly. At a high level, neural compression is based on an autoencoder that tries to reconstruct the input instance from a (quantized) latent representation, coupled with a prior that is used to losslessly compress these latents. Due to limitations on model capacity and imperfect optimization and generalization, such models will suboptimally compress test data in general. However, one of the great strengths of learned compression is that if the test-time data distribution is known and relatively lowentropy (e.g. a camera watching a static scene, a dash cam in an autonomous car, etc.), the model can easily be finetuned or adapted to this distribution, leading to improved RD performance. In this paper we take this concept to the extreme, adapting the full model to a single video, and sending model updates (quantized and compressed using a parameter-space prior) along with the latent representation. Unlike previous work, we finetune not only the encoder/latents but the entire model, and during finetuning take into account both the effect of model quantization and the additional costs incurred by sending the model updates. We evaluate an image compression model on I-frames (sampled at 2 fps) from videos of the Xiph dataset, and demonstrate that full-model adaptation improves RD performance by ∼ 1 dB, with respect to encoder-only finetuning",

    "title": "Filtered Inner Product Projection for Crosslingual Embedding Alignment",
    "abstract": "Due to widespread interest in machine translation and transfer learning, there are numerous algorithms for mapping multiple embeddings to a shared representation space. Recently, these algorithms have been studied in the setting of bilingual lexicon induction where one seeks to align the embeddings of a source and a target language such that translated word pairs lie close to one another in a common representation space. In this paper, we propose a method, Filtered Inner Product Projection (FIPP), for mapping embeddings to a common representation space. As semantic shifts are pervasive across languages and domains, FIPP first identifies the common geometric structure in both embeddings and then, only on the common structure, aligns the Gram matrices of these embeddings. FIPP aligns embeddings to isomorphic vector spaces even when the source and target embeddings are of differing dimensionalities. Additionally, FIPP provides computational benefits in ease of implementation and is faster to compute than current approaches. Following the baselines in Glavaš et al. (2019), we evaluate FIPP in the context of bilingual lexicon induction and downstream language tasks. We show that FIPP outperforms existing methods on the XLING (5K) BLI dataset and the XLING (1K) BLI dataset, when using a self-learning approach, while also providing robust performance across downstream tasks",

We find the bases of these subspaces by analyzing network representations (activations) after learning each task with Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) in a single shot manner and store them in the memory as Gradient Projection Memory (GPM). With qualitative and quantitative analyses, we show that such orthogonal gradient descent induces minimum to no interference with the past tasks, thereby mitigates forgetting.

This semi-infinite dual admits a finite dimensional representation, but its support is over a convex set which is difficult to characterize. In particular, we demonstrate that the non-convex neural network training problem is equivalent to a finite-dimensional convex copositive program. Our work is the first to identify this strong connection between the global optima of neural networks and those of copositive programs. We thus demonstrate how neural networks implicitly attempt to solve copositive programs via semi-nonnegative matrix factorization, and draw key insights from this formulation. We describe the first algorithms for provably finding the global minimum of the vector output neural network training problem, which are polynomial in the number of samples for a fixed data rank, yet exponential in the dimension. However, in the case of convolutional architectures, the computational complexity is exponential in only the filter size and polynomial in all other parameters. We describe the circumstances in which we can find the global optimum of this neural network training problem exactly with soft-thresholded SVD, and provide a copositive relaxation which is guaranteed to be exact for certain classes of problems, and which corresponds with the solution of Stochastic Gradient Descent in practice",

To scale these resource-intensive tasks with an increasing number of deployment targets, Once-For-All (OFA) proposed an approach to jointly train several models at once with a constant training cost. However, this cost remains as high as 40-50 GPU days and also suffers from a combinatorial explosion of sub-optimal model configurations. We seek to reduce this search space – and hence the training budget – by constraining search to models close to the accuracy-latency Pareto frontier. We incorporate insights of compound relationships between model dimensions to build CompOFA, a design space smaller by several orders of magnitude. Through experiments on ImageNet, we demonstrate that even with simple heuristics we can achieve a 2x reduction in training time1 and 216x speedup in model search/extraction time compared to the state of the art, without loss of Pareto optimality!

    "abstract": "Symbolic techniques based on Satisfiability Modulo Theory (SMT) solvers have been proposed for analyzing and verifying neural network properties, but their usage has been fairly limited owing to their poor scalability with larger networks. In this work, we propose a technique for combining gradient-based methods with symbolic techniques to scale such analyses and demonstrate its application for model explanation. In particular, we apply this technique to identify minimal regions in an input that are most relevant for a neural network's prediction. Our approach uses gradient information (based on Integrated Gradients) to focus on a subset of neurons in the first layer, which allows our technique to scale to large networks. The corresponding SMT constraints encode the minimal input mask discovery problem such that after masking the input, the activations of the selected neurons are still above a threshold. After solving for the minimal masks, our approach scores the mask regions to generate a relative ordering of the features within the mask. This produces a saliency map which explains \"where a model is looking\" when making a prediction. We evaluate our technique on three datasets - MNIST, ImageNet, and Beer Reviews, and demonstrate both quantitatively and qualitatively that the regions generated by our approach are sparser and achieve higher saliency scores compared to the gradient-based methods alone",

Our approach relies on the observation that models with limited capacity primarily learn to exploit biases in the dataset. We can leverage the errors of such limited capacity models to train a more robust model in a product of experts, thus bypassing the need to hand-craft a biased model.

    "title": "How Benign is Benign Overfitting?",
    "abstract": "We investigate two causes for adversarial vulnerability in deep neural networks: bad data and (poorly) trained models. When trained with SGD, deep neural networks essentially achieve zero training error, even in the presence of label noise, while also exhibiting good generalization on natural test data, something referred to as benign overfitting [2, 10]. However, these models are vulnerable to adversarial attacks. We identify label noise as one of the causes for adversarial vulnerability, and provide theoretical and empirical evidence in support of this. Surprisingly, we find several instances of label noise in datasets such as MNIST and CIFAR, and that robustly trained models incur training error on some of these, i.e. they don't fit the noise. However, removing noisy labels alone does not suffice to achieve adversarial robustness. Standard training procedures bias neural networks towards learning \"simple\" classification boundaries, which may be less robust than more complex ones. We observe that adversarial training does produce more complex decision boundaries. We conjecture that in part the need for complex decision boundaries arises from sub-optimal representation learning. By means of simple toy examples, we show theoretically how the choice of representation can drastically affect adversarial robustness",

In this work, we take a step towards more robust and interpretable classifiers that explicitly expose the task's causal structure. Building on current advances in deep generative modeling, we propose to decompose the image generation process into independent causal mechanisms that we train without direct supervision. By exploiting appropriate inductive biases, these mechanisms disentangle object shape, object texture, and background; hence, they allow for generating counterfactual images. We demonstrate the ability of our model to generate such images on MNIST and ImageNet. Further, we show that the counterfactual images can improve out-of-distribution robustness with a marginal drop in performance on the original classification task, despite being synthetic. Lastly, our generative model can be trained efficiently on a single GPU, exploiting common pre-trained models as inductive biases",

The dependence on non-standard algorithms makes it hard to integrate segmented models in state-of-the-art deep learning architectures that critically depend on gradient-based optimization techniques. In this work, we formulate a relaxed variant of segmented models that enables joint estimation of all model parameters, including the segmentation, with gradient descent. We build on recent advances in learning continuous warping functions and propose a novel family of warping functions based on the two-sided power (TSP) distribution. TSP-based warping functions are differentiable, have simple closed-form expressions, and can represent segmentation functions exactly. Our formulation includes the important class of segmented generalized linear models as a special case, which makes it highly versatile.

Here we address this issue by suggesting a simple regularization scheme for vanilla RNNs with ReLU activation which enables them to solve long-range dependency problems and express slow time scales, while retaining a simple mathematical structure which makes their DS properties partly analytically accessible. We prove two theorems that establish a tight connection between the regularized RNN dynamics and its gradients, illustrate on DS benchmarks that our regularization approach strongly eases the reconstruction of DS which harbor widely differing time scales, and show that our method is also en par with other long-range architectures like LSTMs on several tasks",

Historically, additionally employing the VGG-based perceptual loss has helped to overcome this issue, significantly improving the synthesis quality, but at the same time limiting the progress of GAN models for semantic image synthesis. In this work, we propose a novel, simplified GAN model, which needs only adversarial supervision to achieve high quality results. We re-design the discriminator as a semantic segmentation network, directly using the given semantic label maps as the ground truth for training. By providing stronger supervision to the discriminator as well as to the generator through spatially- and semantically-aware discriminator feedback, we are able to synthesize images of higher fidelity with better alignment to their input label maps, making the use of the perceptual loss superfluous. Moreover, we enable high-quality multi-modal image synthesis through global and local sampling of a 3D noise tensor injected into the generator, which allows complete or partial image change. We show that images synthesized by our model are more diverse and follow the color and texture distributions of real images more closely.

We posit that an agent can learn more efficiently if we augment reward maximization with self-supervised objectives based on structure in its visual input and sequential interaction with the environment. Our method, Self-Predictive Representations (SPR), trains an agent to predict its own latent state representations multiple steps into the future. We compute target representations for future states using an encoder which is an exponential moving average of the agent's parameters and we make predictions using a learned transition model. On its own, this future prediction objective outperforms prior methods for sample-efficient deep RL from pixels. We further improve performance by adding data augmentation to the future prediction loss, which forces the agent's representations to be consistent across multiple views of an observation. Our full self-supervised objective, which combines future prediction and data augmentation, achieves a median human-normalized score of 0.415 on Atari in a setting limited to 100k steps of environment interaction, which represents a 55% relative improvement over the previous state-of-the-art. Notably, even in this limited data regime, SPR exceeds expert human scores on 7 out of 26 games. We've made the code associated with this work available at https://github.com/mila-iqia/spr",

    "title": "SSD: A Unified Framework for Self-Supervised Outlier Detection",
    "abstract": "We ask the following question: what training information is required to design an effective outlier / out-of-distribution (OOD) detector, i.e, detecting samples that lie far away from training distribution? Since unlabeled data is easily accessible for many applications, the most compelling approach is to develop detectors based on only unlabeled in-distribution data. However, we observe that existing detectors based on unlabeled data perform poorly, often equivalent to a random prediction. In contrast, existing state-of-the-art OOD detectors achieve impressive performance but require access to fine-grained data labels for supervised training. We propose SSD, an outlier detector based on only unlabeled training data. We use self-supervised representation learning followed by a Mahalanobis distance based detection in the feature space. We demonstrate that SSD outperforms existing detectors based on unlabeled data by a large margin. Additionally, SSD even achieves performance on par, and sometimes even better, with supervised training based detectors. Finally, we expand our detection framework with two key extensions. First, we formulate few-shot OOD detection, in which the detector has access to only one to five samples from each class of the targeted OOD dataset. Second, we extend our framework to incorporate training data labels, if available. We find that our novel detection framework based on SSD displays enhanced performance with these extensions, and achieves state-of-the-art performance 1",

    "abstract": "We accelerate deep reinforcement learning-based training in visually complex 3D environments by two orders of magnitude over prior work, realizing end-to-end training speeds of over 19,000 frames of experience per second on a single GPU and up to 72,000 frames per second on a single eight-GPU machine. The key idea of our approach is to design a 3D renderer and embodied navigation simulator around the principle of \"batch simulation\": accepting and executing large batches of requests simultaneously. Beyond exposing large amounts of work at once, batch simulation allows implementations to amortize in-memory storage of scene assets, rendering work, data loading, and synchronization costs across many simulation requests, dramatically improving the number of simulated agents per GPU and overall simulation throughput. To balance DNN inference and training costs with faster simulation, we also build a computationally efficient policy DNN that maintains high task performance, and modify training algorithms to maintain sample efficiency when training with large mini-batches. By combining batch simulation and DNN performance optimizations, we demonstrate that PointGoal navigation agents can be trained in complex 3D environments on a single GPU in 1.5 days to 97% of the accuracy of agents trained on a prior state-of-the-art system using a 64-GPU cluster over three days. We provide open-source reference implementations of our batch 3D renderer and simulator to facilitate incorporation of these ideas into RL systems",

    "abstract": "Time series forecasting is an extensively studied subject in statistics, economics, and computer science. Exploration of the correlation and causation among the variables in a multivariate time series shows promise in enhancing the performance of a time series model. When using deep neural networks as forecasting models, we hypothesize that exploiting the pairwise information among multiple (multivariate) time series also improves their forecast. If an explicit graph structure is known, graph neural networks (GNNs) have been demonstrated as powerful tools to exploit the structure. In this work, we propose learning the structure simultaneously with the GNN if the graph is unknown. We cast the problem as learning a probabilistic graph model through optimizing the mean performance over the graph distribution. The distribution is parameterized by a neural network so that discrete graphs can be sampled differentiably through reparameterization. Empirical evaluations show that our method is simpler, more efficient, and better performing than a recently proposed bilevel learning approach for graph structure learning, as well as a broad array of forecasting models, either deep or non-deep learning based, and graph or non-graph based",

Although it may intuitively seem easier to simply detect attacks rather than build a robust classiﬁer, this has not bourne out in practice even empirically, as most detection methods have subsequently been broken by adaptive attacks, thus necessitating veriﬁable performance for detection mechanisms. In this paper, we propose a new method for jointly training a provably robust classiﬁer and detector. Speciﬁcally, we show that by introducing an additional \"abstain/detection\" into a classiﬁer, we can modify existing certiﬁed defense mechanisms to allow the classiﬁer to either robustly classify or detect adversarial attacks.

    "abstract": "Solving continuous minimax optimization is of extensive practical interest, yet notoriously unstable and difficult. This paper introduces the learning to optimize (L2O) methodology to the minimax problems for the first time and addresses its accompanying unique challenges. We first present Twin-L2O, the first dedicated minimax L2O framework consisting of two LSTMs for updating min and max variables separately. The decoupled design is found to facilitate learning, particularly when the min and max variables are highly asymmetric. Empirical experiments on a variety of minimax problems corroborate the effectiveness of Twin-L2O. We then discuss a crucial concern of Twin-L2O, i.e., its inevitably limited generalizability to unseen optimizees. To address this issue, we present two complementary strategies. Our first solution, Enhanced Twin-L2O, is empirically applicable for general minimax problems, by improving L2O training via leveraging curriculum learning. Our second alternative, called Safeguarded Twin-L2O, is a preliminary theoretical exploration stating that under some strong assumptions, it is possible to theoretically establish the convergence of Twin-L2O. We benchmark our algorithms on several testbed problems and compare against state-of-the-art minimax solvers. The code is available at: https://github.com/VITA-Group/L2O-Minimax",

Then we propose a metric to quantitatively measure the degree of erased information in sample's representation. After that, we study its one-sidedness and imperfection of the incompatibility view through massive analyses, visualizations and comprehensive experiments on Image Classification, Binary Networks, and Neural Machine Translation.

More specifically, we prove that when the hyper-parameter β2 is close enough to 1, RMSprop and its random shuffling version converge to a bounded region in general, and to critical points in the interpolation regime. It is worth mentioning that our results do not depend on \"bounded gradient\" assumption, which is often the key assumption utilized by existing theoretical work for Adam-type adaptive gradient method. Removing this assumption allows us to establish a phase transition from divergence to non-divergence for RMSprop. Finally, based on our theory, we conjecture that in practice there is a critical threshold β∗ 2 , such that RMSprop generates reasonably good results only if 1 > β2 ≥ β∗ 2 .

To mitigate this, we develop a novel contrastive framework for generative model learning, allowing us to train the model not just by the commonality between modalities, but by the distinction between \"related\" and \"unrelated\" multimodal data. We show in experiments that our method enables data-efficient multimodal learning on challenging datasets for various multimodal VAE models.

    "abstract": "Humans can quickly adapt to new partners in collaborative tasks (e.g. playing basketball), because they understand which fundamental skills of the task (e.g. how to dribble, how to shoot) carry over across new partners. Humans can also quickly adapt to similar tasks with the same partners by carrying over conventions that they have developed (e.g. raising hand signals pass the ball), without learning to coordinate from scratch. To collaborate seamlessly with humans, AI agents should adapt quickly to new partners and new tasks as well. However, current approaches have not attempted to distinguish between the complexities intrinsic to a task and the conventions used by a partner, and more generally there has been little focus on leveraging conventions for adapting to new settings. In this work, we propose a learning framework that teases apart rule-dependent representation from convention-dependent representation in a principled way. We show that, under some assumptions, our rule-dependent representation is a sufficient statistic of the distribution over best-response strategies across partners. Using this separation of representations, our agents are able to adapt quickly to new partners, and to coordinate with old partners on new tasks in a zero-shot manner.

Embodied agents require the same abilities, but existing work does not yet provide the infrastructure necessary for both reasoning abstractly and executing concretely.

ALFWorld enables the creation of a new BUTLER agent whose abstract knowledge, learned in TextWorld, corresponds directly to concrete, visually grounded actions. In turn, as we demonstrate empirically, this fosters better agent generalization than training only in the visually grounded environment.

Our approach, Diverse Video Generator, uses a Gaussian Process (GP) to learn priors on future states given the past and maintains a probability distribution over possible futures given a particular sample. In addition, we leverage the changes in this distribution overtime to control the sampling of diverse future states by estimating the end of on-going sequences. That is, we use the variance of GP over the output function space to trigger a change in an action sequence.

Empirically, models trained with our method achieve improved conditional/unconditional image generation along with improved anomaly detection capabilities. Further, we incorporate the same negative data augmentation strategy in a contrastive learning framework for self-supervised representation learning on images and videos, achieving improved performance on downstream image classification, object detection, and action recognition tasks.

However, in the zero-shot learning (ZSL) world, these ideas have received only marginal attention. This work studies normalization in ZSL scenario from both theoretical and practical perspectives. First, we give a theoretical explanation to two popular tricks used in zero-shot learning: normalize+scale and attributes normalization and show that they help training by preserving variance during a forward pass. Next, we demonstrate that they are insufficient to normalize a deep ZSL model and propose Class Normalization (CN): a normalization scheme, which alleviates this issue both provably and in practice. Third, we show that ZSL models typically have more irregular loss surface compared to traditional classifiers and that the proposed method partially remedies this problem. Then, we test our approach on 4 standard ZSL datasets and outperform sophisticated modern SotA with a simple MLP optimized without any bells and whistles and having ≈50 times faster training speed. Finally, we generalize ZSL to a broader problem — continual ZSL, and introduce some principled metrics and rigorous baselines for this new setup.

For this, we define a measure of separation between correct and incorrect classes that is independent of the number of classes: the reversed ROC (rROC), which is obtained by replacing the roles of classes and data-points in the common ROC. We show that the classification accuracy is a function of the rROC in multiclass classifiers, for which the learned representation of data from the initial class sample remains unchanged when new classes are added. Using these results we formulate a robust neural-network-based algorithm, CleaneX, which learns to estimate the accuracy of such classifiers on arbitrarily large sets of classes. Our method achieves remarkably better predictions than current state-of-the-art methods on both simulations and real datasets of object detection, face recognition, and brain decoding",

    "abstract": "Hopfield networks (HNs) and Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs) are two important models at the interface of statistical physics, machine learning, and neuroscience. Recently, there has been interest in the relationship between HNs and RBMs, due to their similarity under the statistical mechanics formalism. An exact mapping between HNs and RBMs has been previously noted for the special case of orthogonal (uncorrelated) encoded patterns. We present here an exact mapping in the general case of correlated pattern HNs, which are more broadly applicable to existing datasets. Specifically, we show that any HN with $N$ binary variables and $p<N$ arbitrary binary patterns can be transformed into an RBM with $N$ binary visible variables and $p$ gaussian hidden variables. We outline the conditions under which the reverse mapping exists, and conduct experiments on the MNIST dataset which suggest the mapping provides a useful initialization to the RBM weights. We discuss extensions, the potential importance of this correspondence for the training of RBMs, and for understanding the performance of deep architectures which utilize RBMs",

    "abstract": "Policy-Space Response Oracles (PSRO) is a general algorithmic framework for learning policies in multiagent systems by interleaving empirical game analysis with deep reinforcement learning (Deep RL). At each iteration, Deep RL is invoked to train a best response to a mixture of opponent policies. The repeated application of Deep RL poses an expensive computational burden as we look to apply this algorithm to more complex domains. We introduce two variations of PSRO designed to reduce the amount of simulation required during Deep RL training. Both algorithms modify how PSRO adds new policies to the empirical game, based on learned responses to a single opponent policy. The first, Mixed-Oracles, transfers knowledge from previous iterations of Deep RL, requiring training only against the opponent's newest policy. The second, Mixed-Opponents, constructs a pure-strategy opponent by mixing existing strategy's action-value estimates, instead of their policies. Learning against a single policy mitigates variance in state outcomes that is induced by an unobserved distribution of opponents. We empirically demonstrate that these algorithms substantially reduce the amount of simulation during training required by PSRO, while producing equivalent or better solutions to the game",

    "title": "On the Origin of Implicit Regularization in Stochastic Gradient Descent",
    "abstract": "For infinitesimal learning rates, stochastic gradient descent (SGD) follows the path of gradient flow on the full batch loss function. However moderately large learning rates can achieve higher test accuracies, and this generalization benefit is not explained by convergence bounds, since the learning rate which maximizes test accuracy is often larger than the learning rate which minimizes training loss. To interpret this phenomenon we prove that for SGD with random shuffling, the mean SGD iterate also stays close to the path of gradient flow if the learning rate is small and finite, but on a modified loss. This modified loss is composed of the original loss function and an implicit regularizer, which penalizes the norms of the minibatch gradients. Under mild assumptions, when the batch size is small the scale of the implicit regularization term is proportional to the ratio of the learning rate to the batch size. We verify empirically that explicitly including the implicit regularizer in the loss can enhance the test accuracy when the learning rate is small",

Bayesian methods are well-suited to tackling the fundamental issue of overfitting in the few-shot scenario because they allow practitioners to specify prior beliefs and update those beliefs in light of observed data. Contemporary approaches to Bayesian few-shot classification maintain a posterior distribution over model parameters, which is slow and requires storage that scales with model size. Instead, we propose a Gaussian process classifier based on a novel combination of Polya-gamma augmentation and the one-vs-each softmax approximation that allows us to efficiently marginalize over functions rather than model parameters.

Concurrently, neural models are continuously expanding from grid-like tensor data into structured representations, such as various attributed graphs and relational databases. To address the irregular structure of the data, the models typically extrapolate on the idea of convolution, effectively introducing parameter sharing in their, dynamically unfolded, computation graphs. The computation graphs themselves then reflect the symmetries of the underlying data, similarly to the lifted graphical models. Inspired by lifting, we introduce a simple and efficient technique to detect the symmetries and compress the neural models without loss of any information.

These directions correspond to semantically meaningful image transformations e.g., shift, zoom, color manipulations), and have similar interpretable effects across all categories that the GAN can generate. Some methods focus on user-specified transformations, while others discover transformations in an unsupervised manner. However, all existing techniques rely on an optimization procedure to expose those directions, and offer no control over the degree of allowed interaction between different transformations. In this paper, we show that \"steering\" trajectories can be computed in closed form directly from the generator's weights without any form of training or optimization. This applies to user-prescribed geometric transformations, as well as to unsupervised discovery of more complex effects. Our approach allows determining both linear and nonlinear trajectories, and has many advantages over previous methods. In particular, we can control whether one transformation is allowed to come on the expense of another (e.g. zoom-in with or without allowing translation to keep the object centered). Moreover, we can determine the natural end-point of the trajectory, which corresponds to the largest extent to which a transformation can be applied without incurring degradation. Finally, we show how transferring attributes between images can be achieved without optimization, even across different categories",

In this work, we investigate principled ways to adversarially perturb a computer program to fool such learned models, and thus determine their adversarial robustness. We use program obfuscations, which have conventionally been used to avoid attempts at reverse engineering programs, as adversarial perturbations. These perturbations modify programs in ways that do not alter their functionality but can be crafted to deceive an ML model when making a decision. We provide a general formulation for an adversarial program that allows applying multiple obfuscation transformations to a program in any language. We develop first-order optimization algorithms to efficiently determine two key aspects – which parts of the program to transform, and what transformations to use. We show that it is important to optimize both these aspects to generate the best adversarially perturbed program. Due to the discrete nature of this problem, we also propose using randomized smoothing to improve the attack loss landscape to ease optimization. We evaluate our work on Python and Java programs on the problem of program summarization.1 We show that our best attack proposal achieves a 52% improvement over a state-of-the-art attack generation approach for programs trained on a SEQ2SEQ model.

    "abstract": "Understanding how large neural networks avoid memorizing training data is key to explaining their high generalization performance. To examine the structure of when and where memorization occurs in a deep network, we use a recently developed replica-based mean field theoretic geometric analysis method. We find that all layers preferentially learn from examples which share features, and link this behavior to generalization performance. Memorization predominately occurs in the deeper layers, due to decreasing object manifolds' radius and dimension, whereas early layers are minimally affected. This predicts that generalization can be restored by reverting the final few layer weights to earlier epochs before significant memorization occurred, which is confirmed by the experiments. Additionally, by studying generalization under different model sizes, we reveal the connection between the double descent phenomenon and the underlying model geometry. Finally, analytical analysis shows that networks avoid memorization early in training because close to initialization, the gradient contribution from permuted examples are small. These findings provide quantitative evidence for the structure of memorization across layers of a deep neural network, the drivers for such structure, and its connection to manifold geometric properties",

A standard solution is to train networks with Quantization Aware Training, where the weights are quantized during training and the gradients approximated with the Straight-Through Estimator. In this paper, we extend this approach to work beyond int8 fixed-point quantization with extreme compression methods where the approximations introduced by STE are severe, such as Product Quantization. Our proposal is to only quantize a different random subset of weights during each forward, allowing for unbiased gradients to flow through the other weights. Controlling the amount of noise and its form allows for extreme compression rates while maintaining the performance of the original model. As a result we establish new state-of-the-art compromises between accuracy and model size both in natural language processing and image classification. For example, applying our method to state-of-the-art Transformer and ConvNet architectures, we can achieve 82.5% accuracy on MNLI by compressing RoBERTa to 14MB and 80.0 top-1 accuracy on ImageNet by compressing an EfficientNet-B3 to 3.3MB",

    "abstract": "Searching for network width is an effective way to slim deep neural networks with hardware budgets. With this aim, a one-shot supernet is usually leveraged as a performance evaluator to rank the performance w.r.t. different width. Nevertheless, current methods mainly follow a manually fixed weight sharing pattern, which is limited to distinguish the performance gap of different width. In this paper, to better evaluate each width, we propose a loCAlly FrEe weight sharing strategy (CafeNet) accordingly. In CafeNet, weights are more freely shared, and each width is jointly indicated by its base channels and free channels, where free channels are supposed to locate freely in a local zone to better represent each width. Besides, we propose to further reduce the search space by leveraging our introduced FLOPs-sensitive bins. As a result, our CafeNet can be trained stochastically and get optimized within a min-min strategy. Extensive experiments on ImageNet, CIFAR-10, CelebA and MS COCO dataset have verified our superiority comparing to other state-of-the-art baselines. For example, our method can further boost the benchmark NAS network EfficientNet-B0 by 0.41% via searching its width more delicately",

Without any prior knowledge of the MDP, we propose a strategic poisoning algorithm called Vulnerability-Aware Adversarial Critic Poison (VA2C-P), which works for most policy-based deep RL agents, using a novel metric, stability radius in RL, that measures the vulnerability of RL algorithms. Experiments on multiple deep RL agents and multiple environments show that our poisoning algorithm successfully prevents agents from learning a good policy, with a limited attacking budget.

Towards answering this question, we evaluate excess risk of a deep learning estimator trained by a noisy gradient descent with ridge regularization on a mildly overparameterized neural network, and discuss its superiority to a class of linear estimators that includes neural tangent kernel approach, random feature model, other kernel methods, $k$-NN estimator and so on. We consider a teacher-student regression model, and eventually show that any linear estimator can be outperformed by deep learning in a sense of the minimax optimal rate especially for a high dimension setting. The obtained excess bounds are so-called fast learning rate which is faster than $O(1/\\sqrt{n})$ that is obtained by usual Rademacher complexity analysis. This discrepancy is induced by the non-convex geometry of the model and the noisy gradient descent used for neural network training provably reaches a near global optimal solution even though the loss landscape is highly non-convex. Although the noisy gradient descent does not employ any explicit or implicit sparsity inducing regularization, it shows a preferable generalization performance that dominates linear estimators",

Many activation functions used in practice satisfy this assumption, exactly or approximately, and we show this property to be sufficient for an adequately deep neural network with n + 1 neurons per layer to approximate arbitrarily well, on a compact set and with respect to the supremum norm, any continuous function from R to R. We further show this result to hold for very simple architectures for which the weights only need to assume two values. The first key technical contribution consists of relating the universal approximation problem to controllability of an ensemble of control systems corresponding to a residual network and to leverage classical Lie algebraic techniques to characterize controllability.

Furthermore, with the set of diverse strategies from RPG, we can (1) achieve higher payoffs by fine-tuning the best policy from the set; and (2) obtain an adaptive agent by using this set of strategies as its training opponents.

    "title": "The Role of Momentum Parameters in the Optimal Convergence of Adaptive Polyak's Heavy-ball Methods",
    "abstract": "The adaptive stochastic gradient descent (SGD) with momentum has been widely adopted in deep learning as well as convex optimization. In practice, the last iterate is commonly used as the final solution. However, the available regret analysis and the setting of constant momentum parameters only guarantee the optimal convergence of the averaged solution. In this paper, we fill this theory-practice gap by investigating the convergence of the last iterate (referred to as individual convergence), which is a more difficult task than convergence analysis of the averaged solution. Specifically, in the constrained convex cases, we prove that the adaptive Polyak's Heavy-ball (HB) method, in which the step size is only updated using the exponential moving average strategy, attains an individual convergence rate of O( 1 √ t ), as opposed to that of O( log t √ t ) of SGD, where t is the number of iterations. Our new analysis not only shows how the HB momentum and its timevarying weight help us to achieve the acceleration in convex optimization but also gives valuable hints how the momentum parameters should be scheduled in deep learning. Empirical results validate the correctness of our convergence analysis in optimizing convex functions and demonstrate the improved performance of the adaptive HB methods in training deep networks",

    "title": "Clustering-friendly Representation Learning via Instance Discrimination and Feature Decorrelation",
    "abstract": "Clustering is one of the most fundamental tasks in machine learning. Recently, deep clustering has become a major trend in clustering techniques. Representation learning often plays an important role in the effectiveness of deep clustering, and thus can be a principal cause of performance degradation. In this paper, we propose a clustering-friendly representation learning method using instance discrimination and feature decorrelation. Our deep-learning-based representation learning method is motivated by the properties of classical spectral clustering. Instance discrimination learns similarities among data and feature decorrelation removes redundant correlation among features. We utilize an instance discrimination method in which learning individual instance classes leads to learning similarity among instances. Through detailed experiments and examination, we show that the approach can be adapted to learning a latent space for clustering. We design novel softmax-formulated decorrelation constraints for learning. In evaluations of image clustering using CIFAR-10 and ImageNet-10, our method achieves accuracy of 81.5% and 95.4%, respectively. We also show that the softmax-formulated constraints are compatible with various neural networks",

    "title": "Learning to Represent Action Values as a Hypergraph on the Action Vertices",
    "abstract": "Action-value estimation is a critical component of many reinforcement learning (RL) methods whereby sample complexity relies heavily on how fast a good estimator for action value can be learned. By viewing this problem through the lens of representation learning, good representations of both state and action can facilitate action-value estimation. While advances in deep learning have seamlessly driven progress in learning state representations, given the specificity of the notion of agency to RL, little attention has been paid to learning action representations. We conjecture that leveraging the combinatorial structure of multi-dimensional action spaces is a key ingredient for learning good representations of action. To test this, we set forth the action hypergraph networks framework---a class of functions for learning action representations with a relational inductive bias. Using this framework we realise an agent class based on a combination with deep Q-networks, which we dub hypergraph Q-networks. We show the effectiveness of our approach on a myriad of domains: illustrative prediction problems under minimal confounding effects, Atari 2600 games, and physical control benchmarks",

    "abstract": "Transformers do not scale very well to long sequence lengths largely because of quadratic self-attention complexity. In the recent months, a wide spectrum of efficient, fast Transformers have been proposed to tackle this problem, more often than not claiming superior or comparable model quality to vanilla Transformer models. To this date, there is no well-established consensus on how to evaluate this class of models. Moreover, inconsistent benchmarking on a wide spectrum of tasks and datasets makes it difficult to assess relative model quality amongst many models. This paper proposes a systematic and unified benchmark, LRA, specifically focused on evaluating model quality under long-context scenarios. Our benchmark is a suite of tasks consisting of sequences ranging from $1K$ to $16K$ tokens, encompassing a wide range of data types and modalities such as text, natural, synthetic images, and mathematical expressions requiring similarity, structural, and visual-spatial reasoning. We systematically evaluate ten well-established long-range Transformer models (Reformers, Linformers, Linear Transformers, Sinkhorn Transformers, Performers, Synthesizers, Sparse Transformers, and Longformers) on our newly proposed benchmark suite. LRA paves the way towards better understanding this class of efficient Transformer models, facilitates more research in this direction, and presents new challenging tasks to tackle.

    "abstract": "Achieving state-of-the-art performance on natural language understanding tasks typically relies on fine-tuning a fresh model for every task. Consequently, this approach leads to a higher overall parameter cost, along with higher technical maintenance for serving multiple models. Learning a single multi-task model that is able to do well for all the tasks has been a challenging and yet attractive proposition. In this paper, we propose HyperGrid Transformers, a new Transformer architecture that leverages task-conditioned hyper networks for controlling its feed-forward layers. Specifically, we propose a decomposable hypernetwork that learns grid-wise projections that help to specialize regions in weight matrices for different tasks. In order to construct the proposed hypernetwork, our method learns the interactions and composition between a global (task-agnostic) state and a local task-specific state. We conduct an extensive set of experiments on GLUE/SuperGLUE. On the SuperGLUE test set, we match the performance of the state-of-the-art while being 16 times more parameter efficient.

    "title": "Influence Estimation for Generative Adversarial Networks",
    "abstract": "Identifying harmful instances, whose absence in a training dataset improves model performance, is important for building better machine learning models. Although previous studies have succeeded in estimating harmful instances under supervised settings, they cannot be trivially extended to generative adversarial networks (GANs). This is because previous approaches require that (i) the absence of a training instance directly affects the loss value and that (ii) the change in the loss directly measures the harmfulness of the instance for the performance of a model. In GAN training, however, neither of the requirements is satisﬁed. This is because, (i) the generator's loss is not directly affected by the training instances as they are not part of the generator's training steps, and (ii) the values of GAN's losses normally do not capture the generative performance of a model. To this end, (i) we propose an inﬂuence estimation method that uses the Jacobian of the gradient of the generator's loss with respect to the discriminator's parameters (and vice versa) to trace how the absence of an instance in the discriminator's training affects the generator's parameters, and (ii) we propose a novel evaluation scheme, in which we assess harmfulness of each training instance on the basis of how GAN evaluation metric (e.g., inception score) is expected to change due to the removal of the instance. We experimentally veriﬁed that our inﬂuence estimation method correctly inferred the changes in GAN evaluation metrics. We also demonstrated that the removal of the identiﬁed harmful instances effectively improved the model's generative performance with respect to various GAN evaluation metrics",

In this work, we highlight the importance of a data-dependent feature extraction step that is key to the obtain good performance in convolutional kernel methods. This step typically corresponds to a whitened dictionary of patches, and gives rise to a data-driven convolutional kernel methods. We extensively study its effect, demonstrating it is the key ingredient for high performance of these methods. Specifically, we show that one of the simplest instances of such kernel methods, based on a single layer of image patches followed by a linear classifier is already obtaining classification accuracies on CIFAR-10 in the same range as previous more sophisticated convolutional kernel methods. We scale this method to the challenging ImageNet dataset, showing such a simple approach can exceed all existing non-learned representation methods. This is a new baseline for object recognition without representation learning methods, that initiates the investigation of convolutional kernel models on ImageNet.

Graph neural networks (GNNs) are designed to exploit the relational inductive bias exhibited in graphs; they have been shown to outperform other forms of neural networks in scenarios where structure information supplements node features. The most common GNN architecture aggregates information from neighborhoods based on message passing. Its generality has made it broadly applicable. In this paper, we focus on a special, yet widely used, type of graphs—DAGs—and inject a stronger inductive bias—partial ordering—into the neural network design. We propose the directed acyclic graph neural network, DAGNN, an architecture that processes information according to the flow defined by the partial order. DAGNN can be considered a framework that entails earlier works as special cases (e.g., models for trees and models updating node representations recurrently), but we identify several crucial components that prior architectures lack. We perform comprehensive experiments, including ablation studies, on representative DAG datasets (i.e., source code, neural architectures, and probabilistic graphical models) and demonstrate the superiority of DAGNN over simpler DAG architectures as well as general graph architectures",

    "abstract": "A generalist robot must be able to complete a variety of tasks in its environment. One appealing way to specify each task is in terms of a goal observation. However, learning goal-reaching policies with reinforcement learning remains a challenging problem, particularly when hand-engineered reward functions are not available. Learned dynamics models are a promising approach for learning about the environment without rewards or task-directed data, but planning to reach goals with such a model requires a notion of functional similarity between observations and goal states. We present a self-supervised method for model-based visual goal reaching, which uses both a visual dynamics model as well as a dynamical distance function learned using model-free reinforcement learning. Our approach learns entirely using offline, unlabeled data, making it practical to scale to large and diverse datasets. In our experiments, we find that our method can successfully learn models that perform a variety of tasks at test-time, moving objects amid distractors with a simulated robotic arm and even learning to open and close a drawer using a real-world robot.

    "abstract": "Image and video synthesis are closely related areas aiming at generating content from noise. While rapid progress has been demonstrated in improving image-based models to handle large resolutions, high-quality renderings, and wide variations in image content, achieving comparable video generation results remains problematic. We present a framework that leverages contemporary image generators to render high-resolution videos. We frame the video synthesis problem as discovering a trajectory in the latent space of a pre-trained and fixed image generator. Not only does such a framework render high-resolution videos, but it also is an order of magnitude more computationally efficient. We introduce a motion generator that discovers the desired trajectory, in which content and motion are disentangled. With such a representation, our framework allows for a broad range of applications, including content and motion manipulation. Furthermore, we introduce a new task, which we call cross-domain video synthesis, in which the image and motion generators are trained on disjoint datasets belonging to different domains. This allows for generating moving objects for which the desired video data is not available. Extensive experiments on various datasets demonstrate the advantages of our methods over existing video generation techniques. Code will be released at https://github.com/snap-research/MoCoGAN-HD",

    "title": "ChipNet: Budget-Aware Pruning with Heaviside Continuous Approximations",
    "abstract": "Structured pruning methods are among the effective strategies for extracting small resource-efficient convolutional neural networks from their dense counterparts with minimal loss in accuracy. However, most existing methods still suffer from one or more limitations, that include 1) the need for training the dense model from scratch with pruning-related parameters embedded in the architecture, 2) requiring model-specific hyperparameter settings, 3) inability to include budget-related constraint in the training process, and 4) instability under scenarios of extreme pruning. In this paper, we present ChipNet, a deterministic pruning strategy that employs continuous Heaviside function and a novel crispness loss to identify a highly sparse network out of an existing dense network. Our choice of continuous Heaviside function is inspired by the field of design optimization, where the material distribution task is posed as a continuous optimization problem, but only discrete values (0 or 1) are practically feasible and expected as final outcomes. Our approach's flexible design facilitates its use with different choices of budget constraints while maintaining stability for very low target budgets. Experimental results show that ChipNet outperforms state-of-the-art structured pruning methods by remarkable margins of up to 16.1% in terms of accuracy. Further, we show that the masks obtained with ChipNet are transferable across datasets. For certain cases, it was observed that masks transferred from a model trained on featurerich teacher dataset provide better performance on the student dataset than those obtained by directly pruning on the student data itself. 1",

Using a debiased contrastive objective, our framework learns time series representations by ensuring that in the encoding space, the distribution of signals from within a neighborhood is distinguishable from the distribution of non-neighboring signals. Our motivation stems from the medical field, where the ability to model the dynamic nature of time series data is especially valuable for identifying, tracking, and predicting the underlying patients' latent states in settings where labeling data is practically impossible.

Although numerous methods exist for enforcing the orthogonality of fully-connected layers, those for convolutional layers are more heuristic in nature, often focusing on penalty methods or limited classes of convolutions. In this work, we propose and evaluate an alternative approach to directly parameterize convolutional layers that are constrained to be orthogonal. Specifically, we propose to apply the Cayley transform to a skew-symmetric convolution in the Fourier domain, so that the inverse convolution needed by the Cayley transform can be computed efficiently. We compare our method to previous Lipschitz-constrained and orthogonal convolutional layers and show that it indeed preserves orthogonality to a high degree even for large convolutions.

Many proposed approaches for self-supervised learning follow naturally a multi-view perspective, where the input (e.g., original images) and the self-supervised signals (e.g., augmented images) can be seen as two redundant views of the data. Building from this multi-view perspective, this paper provides an information-theoretical framework to better understand the properties that encourage successful self-supervised learning. Specifically, we demonstrate that self-supervised learned representations can extract task-relevant information and discard task-irrelevant information. Our theoretical framework paves the way to a larger space of self-supervised learning objective design. In particular, we propose a composite objective that bridges the gap between prior contrastive and predictive learning objectives, and introduce an additional objective term to discard task-irrelevant information. To verify our analysis, we conduct controlled experiments to evaluate the impact of the composite objectives.

However, extracting sound sources which are apparent in natural videos remains an open problem. In this work, we present AudioScope, a novel audio-visual sound separation framework that can be trained without supervision to isolate on-screen sound sources from real in-the-wild videos. Prior audio-visual separation work assumed artificial limitations on the domain of sound classes (e.g., to speech or music), constrained the number of sources, and required strong sound separation or visual segmentation labels. AudioScope overcomes these limitations, operating on an open domain of sounds, with variable numbers of sources, and without labels or prior visual segmentation. The training procedure for AudioScope uses mixture invariant training (MixIT) to separate synthetic mixtures of mixtures (MoMs) into individual sources, where noisy labels for mixtures are provided by an unsupervised audio-visual coincidence model. Using the noisy labels, along with attention between video and audio features, AudioScope learns to identify audio-visual similarity and to suppress off-screen sounds. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach using a dataset of video clips extracted from open-domain YFCC100m video data. This dataset contains a wide diversity of sound classes recorded in unconstrained conditions, making the application of previous methods unsuitable.

    "title": "SaliencyMix: A Saliency Guided Data Augmentation Strategy for Better Regularization",
    "abstract": "Advanced data augmentation strategies have widely been studied to improve the generalization ability of deep learning models. Regional dropout is one of the popular solutions that guides the model to focus on less discriminative parts by randomly removing image regions, resulting in improved regularization. However, such information removal is undesirable. On the other hand, recent strategies suggest to randomly cut and mix patches and their labels among training images, to enjoy the advantages of regional dropout without having any pointless pixel in the augmented images. We argue that the random selection of the patch may not necessarily represent any information about the corresponding object and thereby mixing the labels according to that uninformative patch enables the model to learn unexpected feature representation. Therefore, we propose SaliencyMix that carefully selects a representative image patch with the help of a saliency map and mixes this indicative patch with the target image that leads the model to learn more appropriate feature representation. SaliencyMix achieves a new state-of-the-art top-1 error of 20.09% on ImageNet classification using ResNet-101 architecture and also improves the model robustness against adversarial perturbations. Furthermore, SaliencyMix trained model helps to improve the object detection performance",

Thus, the agent can only use data previously collected by safe policies. While previous work considers optimizing the average performance using offline data, we focus on optimizing a risk-averse criterion. In particular, we present the Offline RiskAverse Actor-Critic (O-RAAC), a model-free RL algorithm that is able to learn risk-averse policies in a fully offline setting. We show that O-RAAC learns policies with higher risk-averse performance than risk-neutral approaches in different robot control tasks. Furthermore, considering risk-averse criteria guarantees distributional robustness of the average performance with respect to particular distribution shifts. We demonstrate empirically that in the presence of natural distribution-shifts, O-RAAC learns policies with good average performance",

    "title": "Adversarially-Trained Deep Nets Transfer Better: Illustration on Image Classification",
    "abstract": "Transfer learning has emerged as a powerful methodology for adapting pre-trained deep neural networks on image recognition tasks to new domains. This process consists of taking a neural network pre-trained on a large feature-rich source dataset, freezing the early layers that encode essential generic image properties, and then fine-tuning the last few layers in order to capture specific information related to the target situation. This approach is particularly useful when only limited or weakly labeled data are available for the new task. In this work, we demonstrate that adversarially-trained models transfer better than non-adversarially-trained models, especially if only limited data are available for the new domain task. Further, we observe that adversarial training biases the learnt representations to retaining shapes, as opposed to textures, which impacts the transferability of the source models. Finally, through the lens of influence functions, we discover that transferred adversarially-trained models contain more human-identifiable semantic information, which explains – at least partly – why adversarially-trained models transfer better",

We propose to address this problem using iterated learning, a cognitive science theory of the emergence of compositional languages in nature that has primarily been applied to simple referential games in machine learning. Considering the layouts of module networks as samples from an emergent language, we use iterated learning to encourage the development of structure within this language. We show that the resulting layouts support systematic generalization in neural agents solving the more complex task of visual question-answering. Our regularized iterated learning method can outperform baselines without iterated learning on SHAPES-SyGeT (SHAPES Systematic Generalization Test), a new split of the SHAPES dataset we introduce to evaluate systematic generalization, and on CLOSURE, an extension of CLEVR also designed to test systematic generalization.

There are however other desirable properties of a CL system, such as the ability to transfer knowledge from previous tasks and to scale memory and compute sub-linearly with the number of tasks. Since most current benchmarks focus only on forgetting using short streams of tasks, we first propose a new suite of benchmarks to probe CL algorithms across these new axes. Finally, we introduce a new modular architecture, whose modules represent atomic skills that can be composed to perform a certain task. Learning a task reduces to figuring out which past modules to re-use, and which new modules to instantiate to solve the current task. Our learning algorithm leverages a task-driven prior over the exponential search space of all possible ways to combine modules, enabling efficient learning on long streams of tasks. Our experiments show that this modular architecture and learning algorithm perform competitively on widely used CL benchmarks while yielding superior performance on the more challenging benchmarks we introduce in this work",

    "abstract": "Poor generalization is one symptom of models that learn to predict target variables using spuriously-correlated image features present only in the training distribution instead of the true image features that denote a class. It is often thought that this can be diagnosed visually using attribution (aka saliency) maps. We study if this assumption is correct. In some prediction tasks, such as for medical images, one may have some images with masks drawn by a human expert, indicating a region of the image containing relevant information to make the prediction. We study multiple methods that take advantage of such auxiliary labels, by training networks to ignore distracting features which may be found outside of the region of interest. This mask information is only used during training and has an impact on generalization accuracy depending on the severity of the shift between the training and test distributions. Surprisingly, while these methods improve generalization performance in the presence of a covariate shift, there is no strong correspondence between the correction of attribution towards the features a human expert has labelled as important and generalization performance. These results suggest that the root cause of poor generalization may not always be spatially defined, and raise questions about the utility of masks as \"attribution priors\" as well as saliency maps for explainable predictions",

Recently, casting probabilistic regression as a multi-task learning problem in terms of conditional latent variable (CLV) models such as the Neural Process (NP) has shown promising results. In this paper, we focus on context aggregation, a central component of such architectures, which fuses information from multiple context data points. So far, this aggregation operation has been treated separately from the inference of a latent representation of the target function in CLV models. Our key contribution is to combine these steps into one holistic mechanism by phrasing context aggregation as a Bayesian inference problem. The resulting Bayesian Aggregation (BA) mechanism enables principled handling of task ambiguity, which is key for efficiently processing context information. We demonstrate on a range of challenging experiments that BA consistently improves upon the performance of traditional mean aggregation while remaining computationally efficient and fully compatible with existing NP-based models",

However, solving the partial differential equations of incompressible fluids is a challenging task and traditional numerical approximation schemes come at high computational costs. Recent deep learning based approaches promise vast speed-ups but do not generalize to new fluid domains, require fluid simulation data for training, or rely on complex pipelines that outsource major parts of the fluid simulation to traditional methods. In this work, we propose a novel physics-constrained training approach that generalizes to new fluid domains, requires no fluid simulation data, and allows convolutional neural networks to map a fluid state from time-point t to a subsequent state at time t + dt in a single forward pass. This simplifies the pipeline to train and evaluate neural fluid models. After training, the framework yields models that are capable of fast fluid simulations and can handle various fluid phenomena including the Magnus effect and Karman vortex streets. We present an interactive real-time demo to show the speed and generalization capabilities of our trained models. Moreover, the trained neural networks are efficient differentiable fluid solvers as they offer a differentiable update step to advance the fluid simulation in time.

While much has been discussed about the supernet's optimization, the architecture selection process has received little attention. We provide empirical and theoretical analysis to show that the magnitude of architecture parameters does not necessarily indicate how much the operation contributes to the supernet's performance. We propose an alternative perturbation-based architecture selection that directly measures each operation's influence on the supernet. We re-evaluate several differentiable NAS methods with the proposed architecture selection and find that it is able to extract significantly improved architectures from the underlying supernets consistently.

    "abstract": "Temporal networks serve as abstractions of many real-world dynamic systems. These networks typically evolve according to certain laws, such as the law of triadic closure, which is universal in social networks. Inductive representation learning of temporal networks should be able to capture such laws and further be applied to systems that follow the same laws but have not been unseen during the training stage. Previous works in this area depend on either network node identities or rich edge attributes and typically fail to extract these laws. Here, we propose Causal Anonymous Walks (CAWs) to inductively represent a temporal network. CAWs are extracted by temporal random walks and work as automatic retrieval of temporal network motifs to represent network dynamics while avoiding the time-consuming selection and counting of those motifs. CAWs adopt a novel anonymization strategy that replaces node identities with the hitting counts of the nodes based on a set of sampled walks to keep the method inductive, and simultaneously establish the correlation between motifs. We further propose a neural-network model CAW-N to encode CAWs, and pair it with a CAW sampling strategy with constant memory and time cost to support online training and inference. CAW-N is evaluated to predict links over 6 real temporal networks and outperforms previous SOTA methods in the inductive setting. CAW-N also outperforms previous methods in 4 out of the 6 networks in the transductive setting. Alg.1 only. It well aligns with our theoretical analysis (Thm.

    "abstract": "3D pose estimation is a challenging but important task in computer vision. In this work, we show that standard deep learning approaches to 3D pose estimation are not robust when objects are partially occluded or viewed from a previously unseen pose. Inspired by the robustness of generative vision models to partial occlusion, we propose to integrate deep neural networks with 3D generative representations of objects into a unified neural architecture that we term NeMo. In particular, NeMo learns a generative model of neural feature activations at each vertex on a dense 3D mesh. Using differentiable rendering we estimate the 3D object pose by minimizing the reconstruction error between NeMo and the feature representation of the target image. To avoid local optima in the reconstruction loss, we train the feature extractor to maximize the distance between the individual feature representations on the mesh using contrastive learning. Our extensive experiments on PASCAL3D+, occluded-PASCAL3D+ and ObjectNet3D show that NeMo is much more robust to partial occlusion and unseen pose compared to standard deep networks, while retaining competitive performance on regular data. Interestingly, our experiments also show that NeMo performs reasonably well even when the mesh representation only crudely approximates the true object geometry with a cuboid, hence revealing that the detailed 3D geometry is not needed for accurate 3D pose estimation.

We experimentally show that simply training local modules with E2E loss tends to collapse task-relevant information at early layers, and hence hurts the performance of the full model. To avoid this issue, we propose an information propagation (InfoPro) loss, which encourages local modules to preserve as much useful information as possible, while progressively discard task-irrelevant information. As InfoPro loss is difficult to compute in its original form, we derive a feasible upper bound as a surrogate optimization objective, yielding a simple but effective algorithm. In fact, we show that the proposed method boils down to minimizing the combination of a reconstruction loss and a normal cross-entropy/contrastive term. Extensive empirical results on five datasets (i.e., CIFAR, SVHN, STL-10, ImageNet and Cityscapes) validate that InfoPro is capable of achieving competitive performance with less than 40% memory footprint compared to E2E training, while allowing using training data with higher-resolution or larger batch sizes under the same GPU memory constraint. Our method also enables training local modules asynchronously for potential training acceleration. Code is available at: https://github.com/blackfeather-wang/InfoPro-Pytorch",

    "title": "Neural Pruning via Growing Regularization",
    "abstract": "Regularization has long been utilized to learn sparsity in deep neural network pruning. However, its role is mainly explored in the small penalty strength regime. In this work, we extend its application to a new scenario where the regularization grows large gradually to tackle two central problems of pruning: pruning schedule and weight importance scoring. (1) The former topic is newly brought up in this work, which we find critical to the pruning performance while receives little research attention. Specifically, we propose an L2 regularization variant with rising penalty factors and show it can bring significant accuracy gains compared with its one-shot counterpart, even when the same weights are removed. (2) The growing penalty scheme also brings us an approach to exploit the Hessian information for more accurate pruning without knowing their specific values, thus not bothered by the common Hessian approximation problems. Empirically, the proposed algorithms are easy to implement and scalable to large datasets and networks in both structured and unstructured pruning. Their effectiveness is demonstrated with modern deep neural networks on the CIFAR and ImageNet datasets, achieving competitive results compared to many state-of-the-art algorithms.

    "title": "QPLEX: Duplex Dueling Multi-Agent Q-Learning",
    "abstract": "We explore value-based multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) in the popular paradigm of centralized training with decentralized execution (CTDE). CTDE has an important concept, Individual-Global-Max (IGM) principle, which requires the consistency between joint and local action selections to support efficient local decision-making. However, in order to achieve scalability, existing MARL methods either limit representation expressiveness of their value function classes or relax the IGM consistency, which may suffer from instability risk or lead to poor performance. This paper presents a novel MARL approach, called duPLEX dueling multi-agent Q-learning (QPLEX), which takes a duplex dueling network architecture to factorize the joint value function. This duplex dueling structure encodes the IGM principle into the neural network architecture and thus enables efficient value function learning. Theoretical analysis shows that QPLEX achieves a complete IGM function class. Empirical experiments on StarCraft II micromanagement tasks demonstrate that QPLEX significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both online and offline data collection settings, and also reveal that QPLEX achieves high sample efficiency and can benefit from offline datasets without additional online exploration",

While it is a common practice to apply a language-agnostic procedure optimizing a joint multilingual task objective, how to properly characterize and take advantage of its underlying problem structure for improving optimization efficiency remains under-explored. In this paper, we attempt to peek into the black-box of multilingual optimization through the lens of loss function geometry. We find that gradient similarity measured along the optimization trajectory is an important signal, which correlates well with not only language proximity but also the overall model performance. Such observation helps us to identify a critical limitation of existing gradient-based multi-task learning methods, and thus we derive a simple and scalable optimization procedure, named Gradient Vaccine, which encourages more geometrically aligned parameter updates for close tasks. Empirically, our method obtains significant model performance gains on multilingual machine translation and XTREME benchmark tasks for multilingual language models. Our work reveals the importance of properly measuring and utilizing language proximity in multilingual optimization, and has broader implications for multi-task learning beyond multilingual modeling",

However, most prior work has focused on post-hoc Shapley explanations, which can be computationally demanding due to its exponential time complexity and preclude model regularization based on Shapley explanations during training. Thus, we propose to incorporate Shapley values themselves as latent representations in deep models—thereby making Shapley explanations first-class citizens in the modeling paradigm. This intrinsic explanation approach enables layer-wise explanations, explanation regularization of the model during training, and fast explanation computation at test time. We define the Shapley transform that transforms the input into a Shapley representation given a specific function. We operationalize the Shapley transform as a neural network module and construct both shallow and deep networks, called SHAPNETs, by composing Shapley modules. We prove that our Shallow SHAPNETs compute the exact Shapley values and our Deep SHAPNETs maintain the missingness and accuracy properties of Shapley values. We demonstrate on synthetic and real-world datasets that our SHAPNETs enable layer-wise Shapley explanations, novel Shapley regularizations during training, and fast computation while maintaining reasonable performance.

An information-laundered model consists of probabilistic components that deliberately maneuver the intended input and output for queries to the model, so the model's adversarial acquisition is less likely.

Many previous works trained end-to-end (E2E) models with supervised learning (SL), however, the bias in annotated system utterances remains as a bottleneck. Reinforcement learning (RL) deals with the problem through using non-differentiable evaluation metrics (e.g., the success rate) as rewards. Nonetheless, existing works with RL showed that the comprehensibility of generated system utterances could be corrupted when improving the performance on fulfilling user requests. In o gur work, we (1) propose modelling the hierarchical structure between dialogue policy and natural language generator (NLG) with the option framework, called HDNO, where the latent dialogue act is applied to avoid designing specific dialogue act representations; (2) train HDNO via hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL), as well as suggest the asynchronous updates between dialogue policy and NLG during training to theoretically guarantee their convergence to a local maximizer; and (3) propose using a discriminator modelled with language models as an additional reward to further improve the comprehensibility. We test HDNO on MultiWoz 2.0 and MultiWoz 2.1, the datasets on multi-domain dialogues, in comparison with word-level E2E model trained with RL, LaRL and HDSA, showing improvements on the performance evaluated by automatic evaluation metrics and human evaluation.

    "abstract": "A key aspect of human intelligence is the ability to infer abstract rules directly from high-dimensional sensory data, and to do so given only a limited amount of training experience. Deep neural network algorithms have proven to be a powerful tool for learning directly from high-dimensional data, but currently lack this capacity for data-efficient induction of abstract rules, leading some to argue that symbol-processing mechanisms will be necessary to account for this capacity. In this work, we take a step toward bridging this gap by introducing the Emergent Symbol Binding Network (ESBN), a recurrent network augmented with an external memory that enables a form of variable-binding and indirection. This binding mechanism allows symbol-like representations to emerge through the learning process without the need to explicitly incorporate symbol-processing machinery, enabling the ESBN to learn rules in a manner that is abstracted away from the particular entities to which those rules apply. Across a series of tasks, we show that this architecture displays nearly perfect generalization of learned rules to novel entities given only a limited number of training examples, and outperforms a number of other competitive neural network architectures",

The above derivation helps us analyze the robustness of this measure for different $f$-divergence functions. With established robustness, this family of $f$-divergence functions arises as useful metrics for the problem of learning with noisy labels, which do not require the specification of the labels' noise rate.

However, their behaviors for simple bilinear games over the probability simplex are still not fully understood -- previous analysis lacks explicit convergence rates, only applies to an exponentially small learning rate, or requires additional assumptions such as the uniqueness of the optimal solution.   In this work, we significantly expand the understanding of last-iterate convergence for OGDA and OMWU in the constrained setting. Specifically, for OMWU in bilinear games over the simplex, we show that when the equilibrium is unique, linear last-iterate convergence is achievable with a constant learning rate, which improves the result of (Daskalakis & Panageas, 2019) under the same assumption. We then significantly extend the results to more general objectives and feasible sets for the projected OGDA algorithm, by introducing a sufficient condition under which OGDA exhibits concrete last-iterate convergence rates with a constant learning rate. We show that bilinear games over any polytope satisfy this condition and OGDA converges exponentially fast even without the unique equilibrium assumption. Our condition also holds for strongly-convex-strongly-concave functions, recovering the result of (Hsieh et al., 2019). Finally, we provide experimental results to further support our theory",

This work provides a unified theoretical analysis of self-training with deep networks for semi-supervised learning, unsupervised domain adaptation, and unsupervised learning. At the core of our analysis is a simple but realistic \"expansion\" assumption, which states that a low-probability subset of the data must expand to a neighborhood with large probability relative to the subset. We also assume that neighborhoods of examples in different classes have minimal overlap. We prove that under these assumptions, the minimizers of population objectives based on self-training and input-consistency regularization will achieve high accuracy with respect to ground-truth labels. By using off-the-shelf generalization bounds, we immediately convert this result to sample complexity guarantees for neural nets that are polynomial in the margin and Lipschitzness.

On the other hand, selecting only one of the techniques ensures good uncertainty estimates at the expense of accuracy. We investigate this pathology and identify a compounding under-confidence among methods which marginalize over sets of weights and data augmentation techniques which soften labels.

Calibrated models guarantee that the probabilistic predictions are neither over- nor under-confident. In the machine learning literature, different measures and statistical tests have been proposed and studied for evaluating the calibration of classification models. For regression problems, however, research has been focused on a weaker condition of calibration based on predicted quantiles for real-valued targets. In this paper, we propose the first framework that unifies calibration evaluation and tests for probabilistic predictive models. It applies to any such model, including classification and regression models of arbitrary dimension. Furthermore, the framework generalizes existing measures and provides a more intuitive reformulation of a recently proposed framework for calibration in multi-class classification",

We first investigate the \\emph{implicit curricula} resulting from architectural and optimization bias and find that samples are learned in a highly consistent order. Next, to quantify the benefit of \\emph{explicit curricula}, we conduct extensive experiments over thousands of orderings spanning three kinds of learning: curriculum, anti-curriculum, and random-curriculum -- in which the size of the training dataset is dynamically increased over time, but the examples are randomly ordered. We find that for standard benchmark datasets, curricula have only marginal benefits, and that randomly ordered samples perform as well or better than curricula and anti-curricula, suggesting that any benefit is entirely due to the dynamic training set size. Inspired by common use cases of curriculum learning in practice, we investigate the role of limited training time budget and noisy data in the success of curriculum learning.

    "abstract": "In learning-assisted theorem proving, one of the most critical challenges is to generalize to theorems unlike those seen at training time. In this paper, we introduce INT, an INequality Theorem proving benchmark, specifically designed to test agents' generalization ability. INT is based on a procedure for generating theorems and proofs; this procedure's knobs allow us to measure 6 different types of generalization, each reflecting a distinct challenge characteristic to automated theorem proving. In addition, unlike prior benchmarks for learning-assisted theorem proving, INT provides a lightweight and user-friendly theorem proving environment with fast simulations, conducive to performing learning-based and search-based research. We introduce learning-based baselines and evaluate them across 6 dimensions of generalization with the benchmark. We then evaluate the same agents augmented with Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) at test time, and show that MCTS can help to prove new theorems",

    "abstract": "Recent methods for learning unsupervised visual representations, dubbed contrastive learning, optimize the noise-contrastive estimation (NCE) bound on mutual information between two views of an image. NCE uses randomly sampled negative examples to normalize the objective. In this paper, we show that choosing difficult negatives, or those more similar to the current instance, can yield stronger representations. To do this, we introduce a family of mutual information estimators that sample negatives conditionally -- in a \"ring\" around each positive. We prove that these estimators lower-bound mutual information, with higher bias but lower variance than NCE. Experimentally, we find our approach, applied on top of existing models (IR, CMC, and MoCo) improves accuracy by 2-5% points in each case, measured by linear evaluation on four standard image datasets. Moreover, we find continued benefits when transferring features to a variety of new image distributions from the Meta-Dataset collection and to a variety of downstream tasks such as object detection, instance segmentation, and keypoint detection",

Most of the existing works, however, focus on \\emph{very small or even infinitesimal} learning rate regime, and fail to cover practical scenarios where the learning rate is \\emph{moderate and annealing}. In this paper, we make an initial attempt to characterize the particular regularization effect of SGD in the moderate learning rate regime by studying its behavior for optimizing an overparameterized linear regression problem. In this case, SGD and GD are known to converge to the unique minimum-norm solution; however, with the moderate and annealing learning rate, we show that they exhibit different \\emph{directional bias}: SGD converges along the large eigenvalue directions of the data matrix, while GD goes after the small eigenvalue directions. Furthermore, we show that such directional bias does matter when early stopping is adopted, where the SGD output is nearly optimal but the GD output is suboptimal. Finally, our theory explains several folk arts in practice used for SGD hyperparameter tuning, such as (1) linearly scaling the initial learning rate with batch size; and (2) overrunning SGD with high learning rate even when the loss stops decreasing",

The early stopping method therefore can be exploited for learning with noisy labels. However, the side effect brought by noisy labels will influence the memorization of clean labels before early stopping. In this paper, motivated by the lottery ticket hypothesis which shows that only partial parameters are important for generalization, we find that only partial parameters are important for fitting clean labels and generalize well, which we term as critical parameters; while the other parameters tend to fit noisy labels and cannot generalize well, which we term as non-critical parameters. Based on this, we propose robust early-learning to reduce the side effect of noisy labels before early stopping and thus enhance the memorization of clean labels. Specifically, in each iteration, we divide all parameters into the critical and non-critical ones, and then perform different update rules for different types of parameters. Extensive experiments on benchmark-simulated and real-world label-noise datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method over the state-of-the-art label-noise learning methods",

We introduce a contrastive learning framework which does not require prior knowledge of specific, task-dependent invariances. Our model learns to capture varying and invariant factors for visual representations by constructing separate embedding spaces, each of which is invariant to all but one augmentation. We use a multi-head network with a shared backbone which captures information across each augmentation and alone outperforms all baselines on downstream tasks.

    "abstract": "Energy-based models (EBMs) have recently been successful in representing complex distributions of small images. However, sampling from them requires expensive Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) iterations that mix slowly in high dimensional pixel space. Unlike EBMs, variational autoencoders (VAEs) generate samples quickly and are equipped with a latent space that enables fast traversal of the data manifold. However, VAEs tend to assign high probability density to regions in data space outside the actual data distribution and often fail at generating sharp images. In this paper, we propose VAEBM, a symbiotic composition of a VAE and an EBM that offers the best of both worlds. VAEBM captures the overall mode structure of the data distribution using a state-of-the-art VAE and it relies on its EBM component to explicitly exclude non-data-like regions from the model and refine the image samples. Moreover, the VAE component in VAEBM allows us to speed up MCMC updates by reparameterizing them in the VAE's latent space. Our experimental results show that VAEBM outperforms state-of-the-art VAEs and EBMs in generative quality on several benchmark image datasets by a large margin. It can generate high-quality images as large as 256$\\times$256 pixels with short MCMC chains. We also demonstrate that VAEBM provides complete mode coverage and performs well in out-of-distribution detection",

To get the best of both worlds, we introduce In-N-Out, which first trains a model with auxiliary inputs and uses it to pseudolabel all the in-distribution inputs, then pre-trains a model on OOD auxiliary outputs and fine-tunes this model with the pseudolabels (self-training).

    "abstract": "We consider a regression problem, where the correspondence between input and output data is not available. Such shuffled data is commonly observed in many real world problems. Taking flow cytometry as an example, the measuring instruments are unable to preserve the correspondence between the samples and the measurements. Due to the combinatorial nature, most of existing methods are only applicable when the sample size is small, and limited to linear regression models. To overcome such bottlenecks, we propose a new computational framework - ROBOT- for the shuffled regression problem, which is applicable to large data and complex models. Specifically, we propose to formulate the regression without correspondence as a continuous optimization problem. Then by exploiting the interaction between the regression model and the data correspondence, we propose to develop a hypergradient approach based on differentiable programming techniques. Such a hypergradient approach essentially views the data correspondence as an operator of the regression, and therefore allows us to find a better descent direction for the model parameter by differentiating through the data correspondence. ROBOT is quite general, and can be further extended to the inexact correspondence setting, where the input and output data are not necessarily exactly aligned. Thorough numerical experiments show that ROBOT achieves better performance than existing methods in both linear and nonlinear regression tasks, including real-world applications such as flow cytometry and multi-object tracking",

However, it is mathematically unclear how deep learning can select a flat minimum among so many minima. To answer the question quantitatively, we develop a density diffusion theory (DDT) to reveal how minima selection quantitatively depends on the minima sharpness and the hyperparameters. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to theoretically and empirically prove that, benefited from the Hessian-dependent covariance of stochastic gradient noise, SGD favors flat minima exponentially more than sharp minima, while Gradient Descent (GD) with injected white noise favors flat minima only polynomially more than sharp minima. We also reveal that either a small learning rate or large-batch training requires exponentially many iterations to escape from minima in terms of the ratio of the batch size and learning rate.

MARS is based on the idea of generating the chemical candidates by iteratively editing fragments of molecular graphs. To search for high-quality candidates, it employs Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling (MCMC) on molecules with an annealing scheme and an adaptive proposal. To further improve sample efficiency, MARS uses a graph neural network (GNN) to represent and select candidate edits, where the GNN is trained on-the-fly with samples from MCMC.

The main computational challenge lies in the effective embedding of symplectic priors to describe the inherently coupled evolution of position and momentum, which typically exhibits intricate dynamics with many degrees of freedom. To solve the problem, we propose a novel neural network architecture, Nonseparable Symplectic Neural Networks (NSSNNs), to uncover and embed the symplectic structure of a nonseparable Hamiltonian system from limited observation data. The enabling mechanics of our approach is an augmented symplectic time integrator to decouple the position and momentum energy terms and facilitate their evolution. We demonstrated the efficacy and versatility of our method by predicting a wide range of Hamiltonian systems, both separable and nonseparable, including vortical flow and quantum system.

We propose a novel method, deep feature instrumental variable regression (DFIV), to address the case where relations between instruments, treatments, and outcomes may be nonlinear. In this case, deep neural nets are trained to define informative nonlinear features on the instruments and treatments. We propose an alternating training regime for these features to ensure good end-to-end performance when composing stages 1 and 2, thus obtaining highly flexible feature maps in a computationally efficient manner.

In this paper, we provide a principled way to characterize continuous-time systems using deep learning tools. Notably, the proposed approach applies to all the major deep learning architectures and requires little modifications to the implementation. The critical insight is to represent the continuous-time system by composing neural networks with a temporal kernel, where we gain our intuition from the recent advancements in understanding deep learning with Gaussian process and neural tangent kernel. To represent the temporal kernel, we introduce the random feature approach and convert the kernel learning problem to spectral density estimation under reparameterization. We further prove the convergence and consistency results even when the temporal kernel is non-stationary, and the spectral density is misspecified.

The sampling process of these models, however, does not allow interruptions and cannot adapt to real-time computational resources. This challenge impedes the deployment of powerful autoregressive models, which involve a slow sampling process that is sequential in nature and typically scales linearly with respect to the data dimension. To address this difficulty, we propose a new family of autoregressive models that enables anytime sampling. Inspired by Principal Component Analysis, we learn a structured representation space where dimensions are ordered based on their importance with respect to reconstruction. Using an autoregressive model in this latent space, we trade off sample quality for computational efficiency by truncating the generation process before decoding into the original data space. Experimentally, we demonstrate in several image and audio generation tasks that sample quality degrades gracefully as we reduce the computational budget for sampling.

    "title": "Understanding the role of importance weighting for deep learning",
    "abstract": "The recent paper by Byrd & Lipton (2019), based on empirical observations, raises a major concern on the impact of importance weighting for the over-parameterized deep learning models. They observe that as long as the model can separate the training data, the impact of importance weighting diminishes as the training proceeds. Nevertheless, there lacks a rigorous characterization of this phenomenon. In this paper, we provide formal characterizations and theoretical justifications on the role of importance weighting with respect to the implicit bias of gradient descent and margin-based learning theory. We reveal both the optimization dynamics and generalization performance under deep learning models. Our work not only explains the various novel phenomenons observed for importance weighting in deep learning, but also extends to the studies where the weights are being optimized as part of the model, which applies to a number of topics under active research",

    "title": "Fast and Complete: Enabling Complete Neural Network Verification with Rapid and Massively Parallel Incomplete Verifiers",
    "abstract": "Formal verification of neural networks (NNs) is a challenging and important problem. Existing efficient complete solvers typically require the branch-and-bound (BaB) process, which splits the problem domain into sub-domains and solves each sub-domain using faster but weaker incomplete verifiers, such as Linear Programming (LP) on linearly relaxed sub-domains. In this paper, we propose to use the backward mode linear relaxation based perturbation analysis (LiRPA) to replace LP during the BaB process, which can be efficiently implemented on the typical machine learning accelerators such as GPUs and TPUs. However, unlike LP, LiRPA when applied naively can produce much weaker bounds and even cannot check certain conflicts of sub-domains during splitting, making the entire procedure incomplete after BaB. To address these challenges, we apply a fast gradient based bound tightening procedure combined with batch splits and the design of minimal usage of LP bound procedure, enabling us to effectively use LiRPA on the accelerator hardware for the challenging complete NN verification problem and significantly outperform LP-based approaches. On a single GPU, we demonstrate an order of magnitude speedup compared to existing LP-based approaches",

    "abstract": "We study how neural networks trained by gradient descent extrapolate, i.e., what they learn outside the support of the training distribution. Previous works report mixed empirical results when extrapolating with neural networks: while multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) do not extrapolate well in certain simple tasks, Graph Neural Network (GNN), a structured network with MLP modules, has shown some success in more complex tasks. Working towards a theoretical explanation, we identify conditions under which MLPs and GNNs extrapolate well. First, we quantify the observation that ReLU MLPs quickly converge to linear functions along any direction from the origin, which implies that ReLU MLPs do not extrapolate most non-linear functions. But, they can provably learn a linear target function when the training distribution is sufficiently \"diverse\". Second, in connection to analyzing successes and limitations of GNNs, these results suggest a hypothesis for which we provide theoretical and empirical evidence: the success of GNNs in extrapolating algorithmic tasks to new data (e.g., larger graphs or edge weights) relies on encoding task-specific non-linearities in the architecture or features",

Doing so requires modeling the background mutation rate, a highly non-stationary stochastic process, across regions of interest varying in size from one to millions of positions. Here, we present the splitPoisson-Gamma (SPG) distribution, an extension of the classical Poisson-Gamma formulation, to model a discrete stochastic process at multiple resolutions. We demonstrate that the probability model has a closed-form posterior, enabling efficient and accurate linear-time prediction over any length scale after the parameters of the model have been inferred a single time. We apply our framework to model mutation rates in tumors and show that model parameters can be accurately inferred from high-dimensional epigenetic data using a convolutional neural network, Gaussian process, and maximum-likelihood estimation. Our method is both more accurate and more efficient than existing models over a large range of length scales. We demonstrate the usefulness of multi-resolution modeling by detecting genomic elements that drive tumor emergence and are of vastly differing sizes",

    "abstract": "Contrastive divergence (CD) learning is a classical method for fitting unnormalized statistical models to data samples. Despite its wide-spread use, the convergence properties of this algorithm are still not well understood. The main source of difficulty is an unjustified approximation which has been used to derive the gradient of the loss. In this paper, we present an alternative derivation of CD that does not require any approximation and sheds new light on the objective that is actually being optimized by the algorithm. Specifically, we show that CD is an adversarial learning procedure, where a discriminator attempts to classify whether a Markov chain generated from the model has been time-reversed. Thus, although predating generative adversarial networks (GANs) by more than a decade, CD is, in fact, closely related to these techniques. Our derivation settles well with previous observations, which have concluded that CD's update steps cannot be expressed as the gradients of any fixed objective function. In addition, as a byproduct, our derivation reveals a simple correction that can be used as an alternative to Metropolis-Hastings rejection, which is required when the underlying Markov chain is inexact (e.g. when using Langevin dynamics with a large step)",

In this work, we investigate the principles behind representing and generating different RNA structural modalities, and propose a flexible framework to jointly embed and generate these molecular structures along with their sequence in a meaningful latent space. Equipped with a deep understanding of RNA molecular structures, our most sophisticated encoding and decoding methods operate on the molecular graph as well as the junction tree hierarchy, integrating strong inductive bias about RNA structural regularity and folding mechanism such that high structural validity, stability and diversity of generated RNAs are achieved.

However, while massively parallel computing is often used for training models, it is rarely used for searching solutions for combinatorial optimization problems. In this paper, we propose a novel massively parallel Monte-Carlo Tree Search (MP-MCTS) algorithm that works efficiently for 1,000 worker scale, and apply it to molecular design. This is the first work that applies distributed MCTS to a real-world and non-game problem. Existing work on large-scale parallel MCTS show efficient scalability in terms of the number of rollouts up to 100 workers, but suffer from the degradation in the quality of the solutions. MP-MCTS maintains the search quality at larger scale, and by running MP-MCTS on 256 CPU cores for only 10 minutes, we obtained candidate molecules having similar score to non-parallel MCTS running for 42 hours. Moreover, our results based on parallel MCTS (combined with a simple RNN model) significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art work. Our method is generic and is expected to speed up other applications of MCTS",

    "abstract": "Mixed-precision quantization can potentially achieve the optimal tradeoff between performance and compression rate of deep neural networks, and thus, have been widely investigated. However, it lacks a systematic method to determine the exact quantization scheme. Previous methods either examine only a small manuallydesigned search space or utilize a cumbersome neural architecture search to explore the vast search space. These approaches cannot lead to an optimal quantization scheme efficiently. This work proposes bit-level sparsity quantization (BSQ) to tackle the mixed-precision quantization from a new angle of inducing bit-level sparsity. We consider each bit of quantized weights as an independent trainable variable and introduce a differentiable bit-sparsity regularizer. BSQ can induce all-zero bits across a group of weight elements and realize the dynamic precision reduction, leading to a mixed-precision quantization scheme of the original model. Our method enables the exploration of the full mixed-precision space with a single gradient-based optimization process, with only one hyperparameter to tradeoff the performance and compression. BSQ achieves both higher accuracy and higher bit reduction on various model architectures on the CIFAR-10 and ImageNet datasets comparing to previous methods",

    "title": "Achieving Linear Speedup with Partial Worker Participation in Non-IID Federated Learning",
    "abstract": "Federated learning (FL) is a distributed machine learning architecture that leverages a large number of workers to jointly learn a model with decentralized data. FL has received increasing attention in recent years thanks to its data privacy protection, communication efficiency and a linear speedup for convergence in training (i.e., convergence performance increases linearly with respect to the number of workers). However, existing studies on linear speedup for convergence are only limited to the assumptions of i.i.d. datasets across workers and/or full worker participation, both of which rarely hold in practice. So far, it remains an open question whether or not the linear speedup for convergence is achievable under non-i.i.d. datasets with partial worker participation in FL. In this paper, we show that the answer is affirmative. Specifically, we show that the federated averaging (FedAvg) algorithm (with two-sided learning rates) on non-i.i.d. datasets in non-convex settings achieves a convergence rate O( 1 √ mKT + 1 T ) for full worker participation and a convergence rate O( 1 √ nKT + 1 T ) for partial worker participation, where K is the number of local steps, T is the number of total communication rounds, m is the total worker number and n is the worker number in one communication round if for partial worker participation. Our results also reveal that the local steps in FL could help the convergence and show that the maximum number of local steps can be improved to T/m. We conduct extensive experiments on MNIST and CIFAR-10 to verify our theoretical results",

    "abstract": "Learning from a limited number of samples is challenging since the learned model can easily become overfitted based on the biased distribution formed by only a few training examples. In this paper, we calibrate the distribution of these fewsample classes by transferring statistics from the classes with sufficient examples. Then an adequate number of examples can be sampled from the calibrated distribution to expand the inputs to the classifier. We assume every dimension in the feature representation follows a Gaussian distribution so that the mean and the variance of the distribution can borrow from that of similar classes whose statistics are better estimated with an adequate number of samples. Our method can be built on top of off-the-shelf pretrained feature extractors and classification models without extra parameters. We show that a simple logistic regression classifier trained using the features sampled from our calibrated distribution can outperform the state-of-the-art accuracy on three datasets (5% improvement on miniImageNet compared to the next best). The visualization of these generated features demonstrates that our calibrated distribution is an accurate estimation.

    "abstract": "While most neural generative models generate outputs in a single pass, the human creative process is usually one of iterative building and refinement. Recent work has proposed models of editing processes, but these mostly focus on editing sequential data and/or only model a single editing pass. In this paper, we present a generic model for incremental editing of structured data (i.e. ''structural edits''). Particularly, we focus on tree-structured data, taking abstract syntax trees of computer programs as our canonical example. Our editor learns to iteratively generate tree edits (e.g. deleting or adding a subtree) and applies them to the partially edited data, thereby the entire editing process can be formulated as consecutive, incremental tree transformations. To show the unique benefits of modeling tree edits directly, we further propose a novel edit encoder for learning to represent edits, as well as an imitation learning method that allows the editor to be more robust. We evaluate our proposed editor on two source code edit datasets, where results show that, with the proposed edit encoder, our editor significantly improves accuracy over previous approaches that generate the edited program directly in one pass. Finally, we demonstrate that training our editor to imitate experts and correct its mistakes dynamically can further improve its performance",

To address this, for the augmented samples from the same training example, we propose to assign different weights to them. We construct the maximal expected loss which is the supremum over any reweighted loss on augmented samples. Inspired by adversarial training, we minimize this maximal expected loss (MMEL) and obtain a simple and interpretable closed-form solution: more attention should be paid to augmented samples with large loss values (i.e., harder examples). Minimizing this maximal expected loss enables the model to perform well under any reweighting strategy. The proposed method can generally be applied on top of any data augmentation methods. Experiments are conducted on both natural language understanding tasks with token-level data augmentation, and image classification tasks with commonly-used image augmentation techniques like random crop and horizontal flip.

    "abstract": "Forecasting complex dynamical phenomena in settings where only partial knowledge of their dynamics is available is a prevalent problem across various scientific fields. While purely data-driven approaches are arguably insufficient in this context, standard physical modeling-based approaches tend to be over-simplistic, inducing non-negligible errors. In this work, we introduce the APHYNITY framework, a principled approach for augmenting incomplete physical dynamics described by differential equations with deep data-driven models. It consists of decomposing the dynamics into two components: a physical component accounting for the dynamics for which we have some prior knowledge, and a data-driven component accounting for errors of the physical model. The learning problem is carefully formulated such that the physical model explains as much of the data as possible, while the data-driven component only describes information that cannot be captured by the physical model; no more, no less. This not only provides the existence and uniqueness for this decomposition, but also ensures interpretability and benefit generalization. Experiments made on three important use cases, each representative of a different family of phenomena, i.e. reaction–diffusion equations, wave equations and the non-linear damped pendulum, show that APHYNITY can efficiently leverage approximate physical models to accurately forecast the evolution of the system and correctly identify relevant physical parameters.

Unlike existing approaches that encode I-frames and P-frames individually, we propose to jointly encode them by establishing bidirectional dynamic connections across streams. To enable self-supervised learning, we propose two pretext tasks that leverage the multimodal nature (RGB, motion vector, residuals) and the internal GOP structure of compressed videos. The first task asks our network to predict zeroth-order motion statistics in a spatio-temporal pyramid; the second task asks correspondence types between I-frames and P-frames after applying temporal transformations.

This subgraph shall be as informative as possible, yet contains less redundant and noisy structure. This problem setting is closely related to the well-known information bottleneck (IB) principle, which, however, has less been studied for the irregular graph data and graph neural networks (GNNs). In this paper, we propose a framework of Graph Information Bottleneck (GIB) for the subgraph recognition problem in deep graph learning. Under this framework, one can recognize the maximally informative yet compressive subgraph, named IB-subgraph. However, the GIB objective is notoriously hard to optimize, mostly due to the intractability of the mutual information of irregular graph data and the unstable optimization process. In order to tackle these challenges, we propose: i) a GIB objective based-on a mutual information estimator for the irregular graph data; ii) a bi-level optimization scheme to maximize the GIB objective; iii) a connectivity loss to stabilize the optimization process. We evaluate the properties of the IB-subgraph in three application scenarios: improvement of graph classification, graph interpretation and graph denoising.

However, for meaningful privacy parameters, a differentially private model degrades the utility drastically when the model comprises a large number of trainable parameters. In this paper, we propose an algorithm Gradient Embedding Perturbation (GEP) towards training differentially private deep models with decent accuracy. Specifically, in each gradient descent step, GEP first projects individual private gradient into a non-sensitive anchor subspace, producing a low-dimensional gradient embedding and a small-norm residual gradient. Then, GEP perturbs the low-dimensional embedding and the residual gradient separately according to the privacy budget. Such a decomposition permits a small perturbation variance, which greatly helps to break the dimensional barrier of private learning. With GEP, we achieve decent accuracy with reasonable computational cost and modest privacy guarantee for deep models. Especially, with privacy bound = 8, we achieve 74.9% test accuracy on CIFAR10 and 95.1% test accuracy on SVHN, significantly improving over existing results",

    "title": "Improving Zero-Shot Voice Style Transfer via Disentangled Representation Learning",
    "abstract": "Voice style transfer, also called voice conversion, seeks to modify one speaker's voice to generate speech as if it came from another (target) speaker. Previous works have made progress on voice conversion with parallel training data and pre-known speakers. However, zero-shot voice style transfer, which learns from non-parallel data and generates voices for previously unseen speakers, remains a challenging problem. We propose a novel zero-shot voice transfer method via disentangled representation learning. The proposed method first encodes speakerrelated style and voice content of each input voice into separated low-dimensional embedding spaces, and then transfers to a new voice by combining the source content embedding and target style embedding through a decoder. With informationtheoretic guidance, the style and content embedding spaces are representative and (ideally) independent of each other. On real-world VCTK datasets, our method outperforms other baselines and obtains state-of-the-art results in terms of transfer accuracy and voice naturalness for voice style transfer experiments under both many-to-many and zero-shot setups",

However, acquiring these skills using only a stream of high-dimensional, unstructured, and unlabeled observations is a tricky challenge for any autonomous agent. Previous methods have used variational autoencoders to encode a scene into a low-dimensional vector that can be used as a goal for an agent to discover new skills. Nevertheless, in compositional/multi-object environments it is difficult to disentangle all the factors of variation into such a fixed-length representation of the whole scene. We propose to use object-centric representations as a modular and structured observation space, which is learned with a compositional generative world model. We show that the structure in the representations in combination with goal-conditioned attention policies helps the autonomous agent to discover and learn useful skills.

Each task is a different reward function defined as a linear combination of known features. We consider a specific class of policy compositions which we call set improving policies (SIPs): given a set of policies and a set of tasks, a SIP is any composition of the former whose performance is at least as good as that of its constituents across all the tasks. We focus on the most conservative instantiation of SIPs, setmax policies (SMPs), so our analysis extends to any SIP. This includes known policy-composition operators like generalized policy improvement. Our main contribution is a policy iteration algorithm that builds a set of policies in order to maximize the worst-case performance of the resulting SMP on the set of tasks. The algorithm works by successively adding new policies to the set. We show that the worst-case performance of the resulting SMP strictly improves at each iteration, and the algorithm only stops when there does not exist a policy that leads to improved performance. We empirically evaluate our algorithm on a grid world and also on a set of domains from the DeepMind control suite. We confirm our theoretical results regarding the monotonically improving performance of our algorithm. Interestingly, we also show empirically that the sets of policies computed by the algorithm are diverse, leading to different trajectories in the grid world and very distinct locomotion skills in the control suite",

    "title": "Rank the Episodes: A Simple Approach for Exploration in Procedurally-Generated Environments",
    "abstract": "Exploration under sparse reward is a long-standing challenge of model-free reinforcement learning. The state-of-the-art methods address this challenge by introducing intrinsic rewards to encourage exploration in novel states or uncertain environment dynamics. Unfortunately, methods based on intrinsic rewards often fall short in procedurally-generated environments, where a different environment is generated in each episode so that the agent is not likely to visit the same state more than once. Motivated by how humans distinguish good exploration behaviors by looking into the entire episode, we introduce RAPID, a simple yet effective episode-level exploration method for procedurally-generated environments. RAPID regards each episode as a whole and gives an episodic exploration score from both per-episode and long-term views. Those highly scored episodes are treated as good exploration behaviors and are stored in a small ranking buffer. The agent then imitates the episodes in the buffer to reproduce the past good exploration behaviors. We demonstrate our method on several procedurally-generated MiniGrid environments, a first-person-view 3D Maze navigation task from MiniWorld, and several sparse MuJoCo tasks. The results show that RAPID significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art intrinsic reward strategies in terms of sample efficiency and final performance.

In this paper, we propose an alternative to training via set losses by viewing learning as conditional density estimation. Our learning framework fits deep energy-based models and approximates the intractable likelihood with gradient-guided sampling. Furthermore, we propose a stochastically augmented prediction algorithm that enables multiple predictions, reflecting the possible variations in the target set. We empirically demonstrate on a variety of datasets the capability to learn multi-modal densities and produce multiple plausible predictions.

    "abstract": "Using a mix of shared and language-specific (LS) parameters has shown promise in multilingual neural machine translation (MNMT), but the question of when and where LS capacity matters most is still under-studied. We offer such a study by proposing conditional language-specific routing (CLSR). CLSR employs hard binary gates conditioned on token representations to dynamically select LS or shared paths. By manipulating these gates, it can schedule LS capacity across sub-layers in MNMT subject to the guidance of translation signals and budget constraints. Moreover, CLSR can easily scale up to massively multilingual settings. Experiments with Transformer on OPUS-100 and WMT datasets show that: 1) MNMT is sensitive to both the amount and the position of LS modeling: distributing 10%-30% LS computation to the top and/or bottom encoder/decoder layers delivers the best performance; and 2) one-to-many translation benefits more from CLSR compared to many-to-one translation, particularly with unbalanced training data. Our study further verifies the trade-off between the shared capacity and LS capacity for multilingual translation. We corroborate our analysis by confirming the soundness of our findings as foundation of our improved multilingual Transformers. Source code and models will be released",

    "abstract": "We study the robustness of reinforcement learning (RL) with adversarially perturbed state observations, which aligns with the setting of many adversarial attacks to deep reinforcement learning (DRL) and is also important for rolling out real-world RL agent under unpredictable sensing noise. With a fixed agent policy, we demonstrate that an optimal adversary to perturb state observations can be found, which is guaranteed to obtain the worst case agent reward. For DRL settings, this leads to a novel empirical adversarial attack to RL agents via a learned adversary that is much stronger than previous ones. To enhance the robustness of an agent, we propose a framework of alternating training with learned adversaries (ATLA), which trains an adversary online together with the agent using policy gradient following the optimal adversarial attack framework. Additionally, inspired by the analysis of state-adversarial Markov decision process (SA-MDP), we show that past states and actions (history) can be useful for learning a robust agent, and we empirically find a LSTM based policy can be more robust under adversaries. Empirical evaluations on a few continuous control environments show that ATLA achieves state-of-the-art performance under strong adversaries.

Our progressive generation only focuses on the sparse set of occupied voxels and their neighborhood, thus enabling the utilization of an expressive sparse convolutional network.

    "abstract": "Differentiable rendering has paved the way to training neural networks to perform \"inverse graphics\" tasks such as predicting 3D geometry from monocular photographs. To train high performing models, most of the current approaches rely on multi-view imagery which are not readily available in practice. Recent Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) that synthesize images, in contrast, seem to acquire 3D knowledge implicitly during training: object viewpoints can be manipulated by simply manipulating the latent codes. However, these latent codes often lack further physical interpretation and thus GANs cannot easily be inverted to perform explicit 3D reasoning. In this paper, we aim to extract and disentangle 3D knowledge learned by generative models by utilizing differentiable renderers. Key to our approach is to exploit GANs as a multi-view data generator to train an inverse graphics network using an off-the-shelf differentiable renderer, and the trained inverse graphics network as a teacher to disentangle the GAN's latent code into interpretable 3D properties. The entire architecture is trained iteratively using cycle consistency losses. We show that our approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art inverse graphics networks trained on existing datasets, both quantitatively and via user studies.

This explains why models obtained by Mixup training exhibits robustness to several kinds of adversarial attacks such as Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM).

In particular, we consider a Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB) model for the tensor program optimization problem. We use UCB to handle the decision-making of time-slot-based optimization, and we devise a Bayesian belief model that allows predicting the potential performance gain of each operator with uncertainty quantification, which guides the optimization process.

In this paper, we challenge this conditional independence assumption and propose a family of expressive autoregressive dynamics models that generate different dimensions of the next state and reward sequentially conditioned on previous dimensions. We demonstrate that autoregressive dynamics models indeed outperform standard feedforward models in log-likelihood on heldout transitions.

Thus the length of the binary codes required to achieve a desired accuracy is quite small, and we show it can even be compressed further without compromising the accuracy.

    "abstract": "Recent works have demonstrated reasonable success of representation learning in hypercomplex space. Specifically, \"fully-connected layers with Quaternions\" (4D hypercomplex numbers), which replace real-valued matrix multiplications in fully-connected layers with Hamilton products of Quaternions, both enjoy parameter savings with only 1/4 learnable parameters and achieve comparable performance in various applications. However, one key caveat is that hypercomplex space only exists at very few predefined dimensions (4D, 8D, and 16D). This restricts the flexibility of models that leverage hypercomplex multiplications. To this end, we propose parameterizing hypercomplex multiplications, allowing models to learn multiplication rules from data regardless of whether such rules are predefined. As a result, our method not only subsumes the Hamilton product, but also learns to operate on any arbitrary nD hypercomplex space, providing more architectural flexibility using arbitrarily 1/n learnable parameters compared with the fully-connected layer counterpart. Experiments of applications to the LSTM and Transformer models on natural language inference, machine translation, text style transfer, and subject verb agreement demonstrate architectural flexibility and effectiveness of the proposed approach",

    "title": "Learning Cross-Domain Correspondence for Control with Dynamics Cycle-Consistency",
    "abstract": "At the heart of many robotics problems is the challenge of learning correspondences across domains. For instance, imitation learning requires obtaining correspondence between humans and robots; sim-to-real requires correspondence between physics simulators and the real world; transfer learning requires correspondences between different robotics environments. This paper aims to learn correspondence across domains differing in representation (vision vs. internal state), physics parameters (mass and friction), and morphology (number of limbs). Importantly, correspondences are learned using unpaired and randomly collected data from the two domains. We propose \\textit{dynamics cycles} that align dynamic robot behavior across two domains using a cycle-consistency constraint. Once this correspondence is found, we can directly transfer the policy trained on one domain to the other, without needing any additional fine-tuning on the second domain. We perform experiments across a variety of problem domains, both in simulation and on real robot. Our framework is able to align uncalibrated monocular video of a real robot arm to dynamic state-action trajectories of a simulated arm without paired data. Video demonstrations of our results are available at: this https URL ",

    "title": "Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning by Discovering Intrinsic Options",
    "abstract": "We propose a hierarchical reinforcement learning method, HIDIO, that can learn task-agnostic options in a self-supervised manner while jointly learning to utilize them to solve sparse-reward tasks. Unlike current hierarchical RL approaches that tend to formulate goal-reaching low-level tasks or pre-deﬁne ad hoc lower-level policies, HIDIO encourages lower-level option learning that is independent of the task at hand, requiring few assumptions or little knowledge about the task structure. These options are learned through an intrinsic entropy minimization objective conditioned on the option sub-trajectories. The learned options are diverse and task-agnostic. In experiments on sparse-reward robotic manipulation and navigation tasks, HIDIO achieves higher success rates with greater sample efﬁciency than regular RL baselines and two state-of-the-art hierarchical RL methods. Code available at https://www.github.com/jesbu1/hidio . We demonstrate the effectiveness of HIDIO compared against other reinforcement learning methods in achieving high rewards with better sample efﬁciency across a variety of robotic navigation and manipulation tasks",

    "title": "Geometry-aware Instance-reweighted Adversarial Training",
    "abstract": "In adversarial machine learning, there was a common belief that robustness and accuracy hurt each other. The belief was challenged by recent studies where we can maintain the robustness and improve the accuracy. However, the other direction, whether we can keep the accuracy while improving the robustness, is conceptually and practically more interesting, since robust accuracy should be lower than standard accuracy for any model. In this paper, we show this direction is also promising. Firstly, we find even over-parameterized deep networks may still have insufficient model capacity, because adversarial training has an overwhelming smoothing effect. Secondly, given limited model capacity, we argue adversarial data should have unequal importance: geometrically speaking, a natural data point closer to/farther from the class boundary is less/more robust, and the corresponding adversarial data point should be assigned with larger/smaller weight. Finally, to implement the idea, we propose geometry-aware instance-reweighted adversarial training, where the weights are based on how difficult it is to attack a natural data point. Experiments show that our proposal boosts the robustness of standard adversarial training; combining two directions, we improve both robustness and accuracy of standard adversarial training",

    "abstract": "Label noise is frequently observed in real-world large-scale datasets. The noise is introduced due to a variety of reasons; it is heterogeneous and feature-dependent. Most existing approaches to handling noisy labels fall into two categories: they either assume an ideal feature-independent noise, or remain heuristic without theoretical guarantees. In this paper, we propose to target a new family of featuredependent label noise, which is much more general than commonly used i.i.d. label noise and encompasses a broad spectrum of noise patterns. Focusing on this general noise family, we propose a progressive label correction algorithm that iteratively corrects labels and refines the model. We provide theoretical guarantees showing that for a wide variety of (unknown) noise patterns, a classifier trained with this strategy converges to be consistent with the Bayes classifier. In experiments, our method outperforms SOTA baselines and is robust to various noise types and levels",

    "abstract": "Numerous task-specific variants of conditional generative adversarial networks have been developed for image completion. Yet, a serious limitation remains that all existing algorithms tend to fail when handling large-scale missing regions. To overcome this challenge, we propose a generic new approach that bridges the gap between image-conditional and recent modulated unconditional generative architectures via co-modulation of both conditional and stochastic style representations. Also, due to the lack of good quantitative metrics for image completion, we propose the new Paired/Unpaired Inception Discriminative Score (P-IDS/U-IDS), which robustly measures the perceptual fidelity of inpainted images compared to real images via linear separability in a feature space. Experiments demonstrate superior performance in terms of both quality and diversity over state-of-the-art methods in free-form image completion and easy generalization to image-to-image translation.

    "abstract": "Reinforcement learning has been shown to be highly successful at many challenging tasks. However, success heavily relies on well-shaped rewards. Intrinsically motivated RL attempts to remove this constraint by defining an intrinsic reward function. Motivated by the self-consciousness concept in psychology, we make a natural assumption that the agent knows what constitutes itself, and propose a new intrinsic objective that encourages the agent to have maximum control on the environment. We mathematically formalize this reward as the mutual information between the agent state and the surrounding state under the current agent policy. With this new intrinsic motivation, we are able to outperform previous methods, including being able to complete the pick-and-place task for the first time without using any task reward.

    "abstract": "Recently, Neural Topic Models (NTMs) inspired by variational autoencoders have obtained increasingly research interest due to their promising results on text analysis. However, it is usually hard for existing NTMs to achieve good document representation and coherent/diverse topics at the same time. Moreover, they often degrade their performance severely on short documents. The requirement of reparameterisation could also comprise their training quality and model flexibility. To address these shortcomings, we present a new neural topic model via the theory of optimal transport (OT). Specifically, we propose to learn the topic distribution of a document by directly minimising its OT distance to the document's word distributions. Importantly, the cost matrix of the OT distance models the weights between topics and words, which is constructed by the distances between topics and words in an embedding space. Our proposed model can be trained efficiently with a differentiable loss. Extensive experiments show that our framework significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art NTMs on discovering more coherent and diverse topics and deriving better document representations for both regular and short texts",

Most existing pooling operations downsample the feature maps, which is a lossy process. Moreover, they are not invertible: upsampling a downscaled feature map can not recover the lost information in the downsampling. By adopting the philosophy of the classical Lifting Scheme from signal processing, we propose LiftPool for bidirectional pooling layers, including LiftDownPool and LiftUpPool. LiftDownPool decomposes a feature map into various downsized sub-bands, each of which contains information with different frequencies. As the pooling function in LiftDownPool is perfectly invertible, by performing LiftDownPool backward, a corresponding up-pooling layer LiftUpPool is able to generate a refined upsampled feature map using the detail sub-bands, which is useful for image-to-image translation challenges. Experiments show the proposed methods achieve better results on image classification and semantic segmentation, using various backbones. Moreover, LiftDownPool offers better robustness to input corruptions and perturbations",

    "abstract": "Unsupervised visual pretraining based on the instance discrimination pretext task has shown significant progress. Notably, in the recent work of MoCo, unsupervised pretraining has shown to surpass the supervised counterpart for finetuning downstream applications such as object detection on PASCAL VOC. It comes as a surprise that image annotations would be better left unused for transfer learning. In this work, we investigate the following problems: What makes instance discrimination pretraining good for transfer learning? What knowledge is actually learned and transferred from unsupervised pretraining? From this understanding of unsupervised pretraining, can we make supervised pretraining great again? Our findings are threefold. First, what truly matters for this detection transfer is low-level and mid-level representations, not high-level representations. Second, the intra-category invariance enforced by the traditional supervised model weakens transferability by increasing task misalignment. Finally, supervised pretraining can be strengthened by following an exemplar-based approach without explicit constraints among the instances within the same category",

Our goal is a general approach for learning equivariances from data, without needing prior knowledge of a task's symmetries or custom task-specific architectures. We present a method for learning and encoding equivariances into networks by learning corresponding parameter sharing patterns from data.

Existing deep learning based approaches often suffer from spatiotemporal biases when applied to video reasoning problems. We propose Hopper, which uses a Multi-hop Transformer for reasoning object permanence in videos. Given a video and a localization query, Hopper reasons over image and object tracks to automatically hop over critical frames in an iterative fashion to predict the final position of the object of interest. We demonstrate the effectiveness of using a contrastive loss to reduce spatiotemporal biases. We evaluate over CATER dataset and find that Hopper achieves 73.2% Top-1 accuracy using just 1 FPS by hopping through just a few critical frames. We also demonstrate Hopper can perform long-term reasoning by building a CATER-h dataset1 that requires multi-step reasoning to localize objects of interest correctly",

However, current pre-training objectives such as masked token prediction (for BERT-style PTLMs) and masked span infilling (for T5-style PTLMs) do not explicitly model the relational commonsense knowledge about everyday concepts, which is crucial to many downstream tasks that need common sense to understand or generate. To augment PTLMs with concept-centric commonsense knowledge, in this paper, we propose both generative and contrastive objectives for learning common sense from the text, and use them as intermediate self-supervised learning tasks for incrementally pre-training PTLMs (before task-specific fine-tuning on downstream datasets). Furthermore, we develop a joint pre-training framework to unify generative and contrastive objectives so that they can mutually reinforce each other. Extensive experimental results show that our method, concept-aware language model (CALM), can pack more commonsense knowledge into the parameters of a pre-trained text-to-text transformer without relying on external knowledge graphs, yielding better performance on both NLU and NLG tasks. We show that while only incrementally pre-trained on a relatively small corpus for a few steps, CALM outperforms baseline methods by a consistent margin and even comparable with some larger PTLMs, which suggests that CALM can serve as a general, plug-and-play method for improving the commonsense reasoning ability of a PTLM",

    "title": "Learning N: M Fine-grained Structured Sparse Neural Networks From Scratch",
    "abstract": "Sparsity in Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) has been widely studied to compress and accelerate the models on resource-constrained environments. It can be generally categorized into unstructured fine-grained sparsity that zeroes out multiple individual weights distributed across the neural network, and structured coarse-grained sparsity which prunes blocks of sub-networks of a neural network. Fine-grained sparsity can achieve a high compression ratio but is not hardware friendly and hence receives limited speed gains. On the other hand, coarse-grained sparsity cannot simultaneously achieve both apparent acceleration on modern GPUs and decent performance. In this paper, we are the first to study training from scratch an N:M fine-grained structured sparse network, which can maintain the advantages of both unstructured fine-grained sparsity and structured coarse-grained sparsity simultaneously on specifically designed GPUs. Specifically, a 2 : 4 sparse network could achieve 2× speed-up without performance drop on Nvidia A100 GPUs. Furthermore, we propose a novel and effective ingredient, sparse-refined straight-through estimator (SR-STE), to alleviate the negative influence of the approximated gradients computed by vanilla STE during optimization. We also define a metric, Sparse Architecture Divergence (SAD), to measure the sparse network's topology change during the training process. Finally, We justify SR-STE's advantages with SAD and demonstrate the effectiveness of SR-STE by performing comprehensive experiments on various tasks.

    "abstract": "Knowledge distillation is an effective approach to leverage a well-trained network or an ensemble of them, named as the teacher, to guide the training of a student network. The outputs from the teacher network are used as soft labels for supervising the training of a new network. Recent studies (Müller et al., 2019; Yuan et al., 2020) revealed an intriguing property of the soft labels that making labels soft serves as a good regularization to the student network. From the perspective of statistical learning, regularization aims to reduce the variance, however how bias and variance change is not clear for training with soft labels. In this paper, we investigate the bias-variance tradeoff brought by distillation with soft labels. Specifically, we observe that during training the bias-variance tradeoff varies sample-wisely. Further, under the same distillation temperature setting, we observe that the distillation performance is negatively associated with the number of some specific samples, which are named as regularization samples since these samples lead to bias increasing and variance decreasing. Nevertheless, we empirically find that completely filtering out regularization samples also deteriorates distillation performance. Our discoveries inspired us to propose the novel weighted soft labels to help the network adaptively handle the sample-wise biasvariance tradeoff. Experiments on standard evaluation benchmarks validate the effectiveness of our method. Our code is available at https://github.com/ bellymonster/Weighted-Soft-Label-Distillation",

    "abstract": "Differentially private SGD (DP-SGD) is one of the most popular methods for solving differentially private empirical risk minimization (ERM). Due to its noisy perturbation on each gradient update, the error rate of DP-SGD scales with the ambient dimension $p$, the number of parameters in the model. Such dependence can be problematic for over-parameterized models where $p \\gg n$, the number of training samples. Existing lower bounds on private ERM show that such dependence on $p$ is inevitable in the worst case. In this paper, we circumvent the dependence on the ambient dimension by leveraging a low-dimensional structure of gradient space in deep networks---that is, the stochastic gradients for deep nets usually stay in a low dimensional subspace in the training process. We propose Projected DP-SGD that performs noise reduction by projecting the noisy gradients to a low-dimensional subspace, which is given by the top gradient eigenspace on a small public dataset. We provide a general sample complexity analysis on the public dataset for the gradient subspace identification problem and demonstrate that under certain low-dimensional assumptions the public sample complexity only grows logarithmically in $p$. Finally, we provide a theoretical analysis and empirical evaluations to show that our method can substantially improve the accuracy of DP-SGD",

    "abstract": "Neural network training can easily overfit noisy labels resulting in poor generalization performance. Existing methods address this problem by (1) filtering out the noisy data and only using the clean data for training or (2) relabeling the noisy data by the model during training or by another model trained only on a clean dataset. However, the former does not leverage the features' information of wrongly-labeled data, while the latter may produce wrong pseudo-labels for some data and introduce extra noises. In this paper, we propose a smooth transition and interplay between these two strategies as a curriculum that selects training samples dynamically. In particular, we start with learning from clean data and then gradually move to learn noisy-labeled data with pseudo labels produced by a time-ensemble of the model and data augmentations. Instead of using the instantaneous loss computed at the current step, our data selection is based on the dynamics of both the loss and output consistency for each sample across historical steps and different data augmentations, resulting in more precise detection of both clean labels and correct pseudo labels. On multiple benchmarks of noisy labels, we show that our curriculum learning strategy can significantly improve the test accuracy without any auxiliary model or extra clean data",

However, as a double-looped optimization problem, MAML needs to differentiate through the whole inner-loop optimization path for every outer-loop training step, which may lead to both computational inefficiency and sub-optimal solutions. In this paper, we generalize MAML to allow meta-learning to be defined in function spaces, and propose the first meta-learning paradigm in the Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS) induced by the meta-model's Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK). Within this paradigm, we introduce two meta-learning algorithms in the RKHS, which no longer need a sub-optimal iterative inner-loop adaptation as in the MAML framework. We achieve this goal by 1) replacing the adaptation with a fast-adaptive regularizer in the RKHS; and 2) solving the adaptation analytically based on the NTK theory. Extensive experimental studies demonstrate advantages of our paradigm in both efficiency and quality of solutions compared to related meta-learning algorithms.

    "title": "Domain Generalization with MixStyle",
    "abstract": "Though convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have demonstrated remarkable ability in learning discriminative features, they often generalize poorly to unseen domains. Domain generalization aims to address this problem by learning from a set of source domains a model that is generalizable to any unseen domain. In this paper, a novel approach is proposed based on probabilistically mixing instancelevel feature statistics of training samples across source domains. Our method, termed MixStyle, is motivated by the observation that visual domain is closely related to image style (e.g., photo vs. sketch images). Such style information is captured by the bottom layers of a CNN where our proposed style-mixing takes place. Mixing styles of training instances results in novel domains being synthesized implicitly, which increase the domain diversity of the source domains, and hence the generalizability of the trained model. MixStyle fits into mini-batch training perfectly and is extremely easy to implement. The effectiveness of MixStyle is demonstrated on a wide range of tasks including category classification, instance retrieval and reinforcement learning",

    "title": "Evaluating the Disentanglement of Deep Generative Models through Manifold Topology",
    "abstract": "Learning disentangled representations is regarded as a fundamental task for improving the generalization, robustness, and interpretability of generative models. However, measuring disentanglement has been challenging and inconsistent, often dependent on an ad-hoc external model or specific to a certain dataset. To address this, we present a method for quantifying disentanglement that only uses the generative model, by measuring the topological similarity of conditional submanifolds in the learned representation. This method showcases both unsupervised and supervised variants. To illustrate the effectiveness and applicability of our method, we empirically evaluate several state-of-the-art models across multiple datasets. We find that our method ranks models similarly to existing methods",

    "title": "Efficient Inference of Flexible Interaction in Spiking-neuron Networks",
    "abstract": "Hawkes process provides an effective statistical framework for analyzing the time-dependent interaction of neuronal spiking activities. Although utilized in many real applications, the classic Hawkes process is incapable of modelling inhibitory interactions among neurons. Instead, the nonlinear Hawkes process allows for a more flexible influence pattern with excitatory or inhibitory interactions. In this paper, three sets of auxiliary latent variables (Polya-Gamma variables, latent marked Poisson processes and sparsity variables) are augmented to make functional connection weights in a Gaussian form, which allows for a simple iterative algorithm with analytical updates. As a result, an efficient expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm is derived to obtain the maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimate. We demonstrate the accuracy and efficiency performance of our algorithm on synthetic and real data. For real neural recordings, we show our algorithm can estimate the temporal dynamics of interaction and reveal the interpretable functional connectivity underlying neural spike trains",

    "title": "R-GAP: Recursive Gradient Attack on Privacy",
    "abstract": "Federated learning frameworks have been regarded as a promising approach to break the dilemma between demands on privacy and the promise of learning from large collections of distributed data. Many such frameworks only ask collaborators to share their local update of a common model, i.e. gradients with respect to locally stored data, instead of exposing their raw data to other collaborators. However, recent optimization-based gradient attacks show that raw data can often be accurately recovered from gradients. It has been shown that minimizing the Euclidean distance between true gradients and those calculated from estimated data is often effective in fully recovering private data. However, there is a fundamental lack of theoretical understanding of how and when gradients can lead to unique recovery of original data. Our research fills this gap by providing a closed-form recursive procedure to recover data from gradients in deep neural networks. We demonstrate that gradient attacks consist of recursively solving a sequence of systems of linear equations. Furthermore, our closed-form approach works as well as or even better than optimization-based approaches at a fraction of the computation, we name it Recursive Gradient Attack on Privacy (R-GAP). Additionally, we propose a rank analysis method, which can be used to estimate a network architecture's risk of a gradient attack. Experimental results demonstrate the validity of the closed-form attack and rank analysis, while demonstrating its superior computational properties and lack of susceptibility to local optima vis a vis optimization-based attacks.

    "title": "Neural Delay Differential Equations",
    "abstract": "Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (NODEs), a framework of continuousdepth neural networks, have been widely applied, showing exceptional efficacy in coping with some representative datasets. Recently, an augmented framework has been successfully developed for conquering some limitations emergent in application of the original framework. Here we propose a new class of continuous-depth neural networks with delay, named as Neural Delay Differential Equations (NDDEs), and, for computing the corresponding gradients, we use the adjoint sensitivity method to obtain the delayed dynamics of the adjoint. Since the differential equations with delays are usually seen as dynamical systems of infinite dimension possessing more fruitful dynamics, the NDDEs, compared to the NODEs, own a stronger capacity of nonlinear representations. Indeed, we analytically validate that the NDDEs are of universal approximators, and further articulate an extension of the NDDEs, where the initial function of the NDDEs is supposed to satisfy ODEs. More importantly, we use several illustrative examples to demonstrate the outstanding capacities of the NDDEs and the NDDEs with ODEs' initial value. Specifically, (1) we successfully model the delayed dynamics where the trajectories in the lower-dimensional phase space could be mutually intersected, while the traditional NODEs without any argumentation are not directly applicable for such modeling, and (2) we achieve lower loss and higher accuracy not only for the data produced synthetically by complex models but also for the real-world image datasets, i.e., CIFAR10, MNIST, and SVHN. Our results on the NDDEs reveal that appropriately articulating the elements of dynamical systems into the network design is truly beneficial to promoting the network performance",

    "title": "Simple Spectral Graph Convolution",
    "abstract": "Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) are leading methods for learning graph representations. However, without specially designed architectures, the performance of GCNs degrades quickly with increased depth. As the aggregated neighborhood size and neural network depth are two completely orthogonal aspects of graph representation, several methods focus on summarizing the neighborhood by aggregating K-hop neighborhoods of nodes while using shallow neural networks. However, these methods still encounter oversmoothing, and suffer from high computation and storage costs. In this paper, we use a modified Markov Diffusion Kernel to derive a variant of GCN called Simple Spectral Graph Convolution (S2GC). Our spectral analysis shows that our simple spectral graph convolution used in S2GC is a trade-off of lowand high-pass filter bands which capture the global and local contexts of each node. We provide two theoretical claims which demonstrate that we can aggregate over a sequence of increasingly larger neighborhoods compared to competitors while limiting severe oversmoothing. Our experimental evaluations show that S2GC with a linear learner is competitive in text and node classification tasks. Moreover, S2GC is comparable to other state-of-the-art methods for node clustering and community prediction tasks",

    "title": "IOT: Instance-wise Layer Reordering for Transformer Structures",
    "abstract": "With sequentially stacked self-attention, (optional) encoder-decoder attention, and feed-forward layers, Transformer achieves big success in natural language processing (NLP), and many variants have been proposed. Currently, almost all these models assume that the layer order is fixed and kept the same across data samples. We observe that different data samples actually favor different orders of the layers. Based on this observation, in this work, we break the assumption of the fixed layer order in Transformer and introduce instance-wise layer reordering into model structure. Our Instance-wise Ordered Transformer (IOT) can model variant functions by reordered layers, which enables each sample to select the better one to improve the model performance under the constraint of almost same number of parameters. To achieve this, we introduce a light predictor with negligible parameter and inference cost to decide the most capable and favorable layer order for any input sequence. Experiments on 3 tasks (neural machine translation, abstractive summarization, and code generation) and 9 datasets demonstrate consistent improvements of our method. We further show that our method can also be applied to other architectures beyond Transformer. Our code is released at Github1",

    "abstract": "Neural ordinary differential equations (Neural ODEs) are a new family of deeplearning models with continuous depth. However, the numerical estimation of the gradient in the continuous case is not well solved: existing implementations of the adjoint method suffer from inaccuracy in reverse-time trajectory, while the naive method and the adaptive checkpoint adjoint method (ACA) have a memory cost that grows with integration time. In this project, based on the asynchronous leapfrog (ALF) solver, we propose the Memory-efficient ALF Integrator (MALI), which has a constant memory cost w.r.t number of solver steps in integration similar to the adjoint method, and guarantees accuracy in reverse-time trajectory (hence accuracy in gradient estimation). We validate MALI in various tasks: on image recognition tasks, to our knowledge, MALI is the first to enable feasible training of a Neural ODE on ImageNet and outperform a well-tuned ResNet, while existing methods fail due to either heavy memory burden or inaccuracy; for time series modeling, MALI significantly outperforms the adjoint method; and for continuous generative models, MALI achieves new state-of-theart performance.We provide a pypi package: https://jzkay12.github. io/TorchDiffEqPack",

    "title": "Enjoy Your Editing: Controllable GANs for Image Editing via Latent Space Navigation",
    "abstract": "Controllable semantic image editing enables a user to change entire image attributes with few clicks, e.g., gradually making a summer scene look like it was taken in winter. Classic approaches for this task use a Generative Adversarial Net (GAN) to learn a latent space and suitable latent-space transformations. However, current approaches often suffer from attribute edits which are entangled, global image identity changes, and diminished photo-realism. To address these concerns, we learn multiple attribute transformations simultaneously, we integrate attribute regression into the training of transformation functions, apply a content loss and an adversarial loss that encourage the maintenance of image identity and photo-realism. We propose quantitative evaluation strategies for measuring controllable editing performance, unlike prior work which primarily focuses on qualitative evaluation. Our model permits better control for both singleand multiple-attribute editing, while also preserving image identity and realism during transformation. We provide empirical results for both real and synthetic images, highlighting that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance for targeted image manipulation",

    "title": "Effective Abstract Reasoning with Dual-Contrast Network",
    "abstract": "As a step towards improving the abstract reasoning capability of machines, we aim to solve Raven's Progressive Matrices (RPM) with neural networks, since solving RPM puzzles is highly correlated with human intelligence. Unlike previous methods that use auxiliary annotations or assume hidden rules to produce appropriate feature representation, we only use the ground truth answer of each question for model learning, aiming for an intelligent agent to have a strong learning capability with a small amount of supervision. Based on the RPM problem formulation, the correct answer ﬁlled into the missing entry of the third row/column has to best satisfy the same rules shared between the ﬁrst two rows/columns. Thus we design a simple yet effective Dual-Contrast Network (DCNet) to exploit the inherent structure of RPM puzzles. Speciﬁcally, a rule contrast module is designed to compare the latent rules between the ﬁlled row/column and the ﬁrst two rows/columns; a choice contrast module is designed to increase the relative differences between candidate choices. Experimental results on the RAVEN and PGM datasets show that DCNet outperforms the state-of-the-art methods by a large margin of 5.77%. Further experiments on few training samples and model generalization also show the effectiveness of DCNet. Code is available at https://github.com/visiontao/dcnet. Abstract",

    "title": "Fooling a Complete Neural Network Verifier",
    "abstract": "The efficient and accurate characterization of the robustness of neural networks to input perturbation is an important open problem. Many approaches exist including heuristic and exact (or complete) methods. Complete methods are expensive but their mathematical formulation guarantees that they provide exact robustness metrics. However, this guarantee is valid only if we assume that the verified network applies arbitrary-precision arithmetic and the verifier is reliable. In practice, however, both the networks and the verifiers apply limited-precision floating point arithmetic. In this paper, we show that numerical roundoff errors can be exploited to craft adversarial networks, in which the actual robustness and the robustness computed by a state-of-the-art complete verifier radically differ. We also show that such adversarial networks can be used to insert a backdoor into any network in such a way that the backdoor is completely missed by the verifier. The attack is easy to detect in its naive form but, as we show, the adversarial network can be transformed to make its detection less trivial. We offer a simple defense against our particular attack based on adding a very small perturbation to the network weights. However, our conjecture is that other numerical attacks are possible, and exact verification has to take into account all the details of the computation executed by the verified networks, which makes the problem significantly harder",

    "abstract": "Recent advances in semi-supervised learning (SSL) demonstrate that a combination of consistency regularization and pseudo-labeling can effectively improve image classification accuracy in the low-data regime. Compared to classification, semantic segmentation tasks require much more intensive labeling costs. Thus, these tasks greatly benefit from data-efficient training methods. However, structured outputs in segmentation render particular difficulties (e.g., designing pseudo-labeling and augmentation) to apply existing SSL strategies. To address this problem, we present a simple and novel re-design of pseudo-labeling to generate well-calibrated structured pseudo labels for training with unlabeled or weakly-labeled data. Our proposed pseudo-labeling strategy is network structure agnostic to apply in a one-stage consistency training framework. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed pseudo-labeling strategy in both low-data and high-data regimes. Extensive experiments have validated that pseudo labels generated from wisely fusing diverse sources and strong data augmentation are crucial to consistency training for segmentation.

Besides obtaining state-of-the-art on monolingual code summarization on all five programming languages considered in this work, we propose the first multilingual code summarization model. We show that jointly training on non-parallel data from multiple programming languages improves results on all individual languages, where the strongest gains are on low-resource languages. Remarkably, multilingual training only from Context does not lead to the same improvements, highlighting the benefits of combining Structure and Context for representation learning on code",

The underlying minmax optimization is highly susceptible to the variance of the stochastic gradient and the rotational component of the associated game vector field. To tackle these challenges, we propose the Lookahead algorithm for minmax optimization, originally developed for single objective minimization only. The backtracking step of our Lookahead-minmax naturally handles the rotational game dynamics, a property which was identified to be key for enabling gradient ascent descent methods to converge on challenging examples often analyzed in the literature. Moreover, it implicitly handles high variance without using large mini-batches, known to be essential for reaching state of the art performance. Experimental results on MNIST, SVHN, CIFAR-10, and ImageNet demonstrate a clear advantage of combining Lookahead-minmax with Adam or extragradient, in terms of performance and improved stability, for negligible memory and computational cost. Using 30-fold fewer parameters and 16-fold smaller minibatches we outperform the reported performance of the class-dependent BigGAN on CIFAR-10 by obtaining FID of 12.19 without using the class labels, bringing state-of-the-art GAN training within reach of common computational resources",
