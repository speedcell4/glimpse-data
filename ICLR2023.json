    "volume": "oral",
    "abstract": "This paper novelly breaks down with ignorable loss an RNN layer into a sequence of simple RNNs, each of which can be further rewritten into a lightweight positional encoding matrix of a self-attention, named the Recurrence Encoding Matrix (REM). Thus, recurrent dynamics introduced by the RNN layer can be encapsulated into the positional encodings of a multihead self-attention, and this makes it possible to seamlessly incorporate these recurrent dynamics into a Transformer, leading to a new module, Self-Attention with Recurrence (RSA). The proposed module can leverage the recurrent inductive bias of REMs to achieve a better sample efficiency than its corresponding baseline Transformer, while the self-attention is used to model the remaining non-recurrent signals. The relative proportions of these two components are controlled by a data-driven gated mechanism, and the effectiveness of RSA modules are demonstrated by four sequential learning tasks",

    "abstract": "Content creators compete for user attention. Their reach crucially depends on algorithmic choices made by developers on online platforms. To maximize exposure, many creators adapt strategically, as evidenced by examples like the sprawling search engine optimization industry. This begets competition for the finite user attention pool. We formalize these dynamics in what we call an exposure game, a model of incentives induced by modern algorithms including factorization and (deep) two-tower architectures. We prove that seemingly innocuous algorithmic choices—e.g., non-negative vs. unconstrained factorization—significantly affect the existence and character of (Nash) equilibria in exposure games. We proffer use of creator behavior models like ours for an (ex-ante) pre-deployment audit. Such an audit can identify misalignment between desirable and incentivized content, and thus complement post-hoc measures like content filtering and moderation. To this end, we propose tools for numerically finding equilibria in exposure games, and illustrate results of an audit on the MovieLens and LastFM datasets. Among else, we find that the strategically produced content exhibits strong dependence between algorithmic exploration and content diversity, and between model expressivity and bias towards gender-based user and creator groups",

    "abstract": "While neural architecture search (NAS) is an intensely-researched area, approaches typically still suffer from either (i) high computational costs or (ii) lack of robustness across datasets and experiments. Furthermore, most methods start searching for an optimal architecture from scratch, ignoring prior knowledge. This is in contrast to the manual design process by researchers and engineers that leverage previous deep learning experiences by, e.g., transferring architectures from previously solved, related problems. We propose to adopt this human design strategy and introduce a novel surrogate for NAS, that is meta-learned across prior architecture evaluations across different datasets. We utilizes Bayesian Optimization (BO) with deep-kernel Gaussian Processes, graph neural networks for the architecture embeddings and a transformer-based set encoder of datasets. As a result, our method consistently achieves state-of-the-art results on six computer vision datasets, while being as fast as one-shot NAS methods",

    "title": "Scaling Up Probabilistic Circuits by Latent Variable Distillation",
    "volume": "oral",
    "abstract": "Probabilistic Circuits (PCs) are a unified framework for tractable probabilistic models that support efficient computation of various probabilistic queries (e.g., marginal probabilities). One key challenge is to scale PCs to model large and high-dimensional real-world datasets: we observe that as the number of parameters in PCs increases, their performance immediately plateaus. This phenomenon suggests that the existing optimizers fail to exploit the full expressive power of large PCs. We propose to overcome such bottleneck by latent variable distillation: we leverage the less tractable but more expressive deep generative models to provide extra supervision over the latent variables of PCs. Specifically, we extract information from Transformer-based generative models to assign values to latent variables of PCs, providing guidance to PC optimizers. Experiments on both image and language modeling benchmarks (e.g., ImageNet and WikiText-2) show that latent variable distillation substantially boosts the performance of large PCs compared to their counterparts without latent variable distillation. In particular, on the image modeling benchmarks, PCs achieve competitive performance against some of the widely-used deep generative models, including variational autoencoders and flow-based models, opening up new avenues for tractable generative modeling.

    "abstract": "The success of deep learning is due in large part to our ability to solve certain massive non-convex optimization problems with relative ease. Though non-convex optimization is NP-hard, simple algorithms -- often variants of stochastic gradient descent -- exhibit surprising effectiveness in fitting large neural networks in practice. We argue that neural network loss landscapes often contain (nearly) a single basin after accounting for all possible permutation symmetries of hidden units a la Entezari et al. 2021. We introduce three algorithms to permute the units of one model to bring them into alignment with a reference model in order to merge the two models in weight space. This transformation produces a functionally equivalent set of weights that lie in an approximately convex basin near the reference model. Experimentally, we demonstrate the single basin phenomenon across a variety of model architectures and datasets, including the first (to our knowledge) demonstration of zero-barrier linear mode connectivity between independently trained ResNet models on CIFAR-10. Additionally, we identify intriguing phenomena relating model width and training time to mode connectivity. Finally, we discuss shortcomings of the linear mode connectivity hypothesis, including a counterexample to the single basin theory",

While such conditions might seem irrelevant to online reinforcement learning at first glance, we establish a new connection by showing---somewhat surprisingly---that the mere existence of a data distribution with good coverage can enable sample-efficient online RL. Concretely, we show that coverability---that is, existence of a data distribution that satisfies a ubiquitous coverage condition called concentrability---can be viewed as a structural property of the underlying MDP, and can be exploited by standard algorithms for sample-efficient exploration, even when the agent does not know said distribution. We complement this result by proving that several weaker notions of coverage, despite being sufficient for offline RL, are insufficient for online RL. We also show that existing complexity measures for online RL, including Bellman rank and Bellman-Eluder dimension, fail to optimally capture coverability, and propose a new complexity measure, the self-normalized coefficient, to provide a unification",

    "volume": "oral",
    "abstract": "There is a fundamental limitation in the prediction performance that a machine learning model can achieve due to the inevitable uncertainty of the prediction target. In classification problems, this can be characterized by the Bayes error, which is the best achievable error with any classifier. The Bayes error can be used as a criterion to evaluate classifiers with state-of-the-art performance and can be used to detect test set overfitting. We propose a simple and direct Bayes error estimator, where we just take the mean of the labels that show \\emph{uncertainty} of the class assignments. Our flexible approach enables us to perform Bayes error estimation even for weakly supervised data. In contrast to others, our method is model-free and even instance-free. Moreover, it has no hyperparameters and gives a more accurate estimate of the Bayes error than several baselines empirically. Experiments using our method suggest that recently proposed deep networks such as the Vision Transformer may have reached, or is about to reach, the Bayes error for benchmark datasets. Finally, we discuss how we can study the inherent difficulty of the acceptance/rejection decision for scientific articles, by estimating the Bayes error of the ICLR papers from 2017 to 2023",

    "abstract": "The potential of offline reinforcement learning (RL) is that high-capacity models trained on large, heterogeneous datasets can lead to agents that generalize broadly, analogously to similar advances in vision and NLP. However, recent works argue that offline RL methods encounter unique challenges to scaling up model capacity. Drawing on the learnings from these works, we re-examine previous design choices and find that with appropriate choices: ResNets, cross-entropy based distributional backups, and feature normalization, offline Q-learning algorithms exhibit strong performance that scales with model capacity. Using multi-task Atari as a testbed for scaling and generalization, we train a single policy on 40 games with near-human performance using up-to 80 million parameter networks, finding that model performance scales favorably with capacity. In contrast to prior work, we extrapolate beyond dataset performance even when trained entirely on a large (400M transitions) but highly suboptimal dataset (51% human-level performance). Compared to return-conditioned supervised approaches, offline Q-learning scales similarly with model capacity and has better performance, especially when the dataset is suboptimal. Finally, we show that offline Q-learning with a diverse dataset is sufficient to learn powerful representations that facilitate rapid transfer to novel games and fast online learning on new variations of a training game, improving over existing state-of-the-art representation learning approaches",

They can construct new predictors from sequences of labeled examples $(x, f(x))$ presented in the input without further parameter updates. We investigate the hypothesis that transformer-based in-context learners implement standard learning algorithms implicitly, by encoding context-specific parametric models in their hidden representations, and updating these implicit models as new examples appear in the context. Using linear regression as a model problem, we offer three sources of evidence for this hypothesis. First, we prove by construction that transformers can implement learning algorithms for linear models based on gradient descent and closed-form computation of regression parameters. Second, we show that trained in-context learners closely match the predictors computed by gradient descent, ridge regression, and exact least-squares regression, transitioning between different predictors as transformer depth and dataset noise vary. Third, we present preliminary evidence that in-context learners share algorithmic features with these predictors: learners' late layers encode weight vectors and moment matrices. These results suggest that in-context learning is understandable in algorithmic terms, and that (at least in the linear case) learners may work by rediscovering standard estimation algorithms",

    "title": "When and Why Vision-Language Models Behave like Bags-Of-Words, and What to Do About It?",
    "volume": "oral",
    "abstract": "Despite the success of large vision and language models (VLMs) in many downstream applications, it is unclear how well they encode the compositional relationships between objects and attributes. Here, we create the Attribution, Relation, and Order (ARO) benchmark to systematically evaluate the ability of VLMs to understand different types of relationships, attributes, and order information. ARO consists of \\emph{Visual Genome Attribution}, to test the understanding of objects' properties; \\emph{Visual Genome Relation}, to test for relational understanding; and \\emph{COCO-Order \\& Flickr30k-Order}, to test for order sensitivity in VLMs. ARO is orders of magnitude larger than previous benchmarks of compositionality, with more than 50,000 test cases. We present the settings where state-of-the-art VLMs behave like bags-of-words---i.e. when they have poor relational understanding, can blunder when linking objects to their attributes, and demonstrate a severe lack of order sensitivity. VLMs are predominantly trained and evaluated on large scale datasets with rich compositional structure in the images and captions. Yet, training on these datasets has not been enough to address the lack of compositional understanding, and evaluating on these datasets has failed to surface this deficiency. To understand why these limitations emerge and are not represented in the standard tests, we zoom into the evaluation and training procedures. We demonstrate that it is possible to perform well on image-text retrieval over existing datasets without using the composition and order information. This further motivates the value of using ARO to benchmark VLMs. Given that contrastive pretraining optimizes for retrieval on large datasets with similar shortcuts, we hypothesize that this can explain why the models do not need to learn to represent compositional information. This finding suggests a natural solution: composition-aware hard negative mining. We show that a simple-to-implement modification of contrastive learning significantly improves the performance on tasks requiring understanding of order and compositionality",

    "abstract": "Offline reinforcement learning (RL) promises the ability to learn effective policies solely using existing, static datasets, without any costly online interaction. To do so, offline RL methods must handle distributional shift between the dataset and the learned policy. The most common approach is to learn conservative, or lower-bound, value functions, which underestimate the return of OOD actions. However, such methods exhibit one notable drawback: policies optimized on such value functions can only behave according to a fixed, possibly suboptimal, degree of conservatism. However, this can be alleviated if we instead are able to learn policies for varying degrees of conservatism at training time and devise a method to dynamically choose one of them during evaluation. To do so, in this work, we propose learning value functions that additionally condition on the degree of conservatism, which we dub confidence-conditioned value functions. We derive a new form of a Bellman backup that simultaneously learns Q-values for any degree of confidence with high probability. By conditioning on confidence, our value functions enable adaptive strategies during online evaluation by controlling for confidence level using the history of observations thus far. This approach can be implemented in practice by conditioning the Q-function from existing conservative algorithms on the confidence. We theoretically show that our learned value functions produce conservative estimates of the true value at any desired confidence. Finally, we empirically show that our algorithm outperforms existing conservative offline RL algorithms on multiple discrete control domains",

    "abstract": "Inferring reward functions from human behavior is at the center of value alignment – aligning AI objectives with what we, humans, actually want. But doing so relies on models of how humans behave given their objectives. After decades of research in cognitive science, neuroscience, and behavioral economics, obtaining accurate human models remains an open research topic. This begs the question: how accurate do these models need to be in order for the reward inference to be accurate? On the one hand, if small errors in the model can lead to catastrophic error in inference, the entire framework of reward learning seems ill-fated, as we will never have perfect models of human behavior. On the other hand, if as our models improve, we can have a guarantee that reward accuracy also improves, this would show the benefit of more work on the modeling side. We study this question both theoretically and empirically. We do show that it is unfortunately possible to construct small adversarial biases in behavior that lead to arbitrarily large errors in the inferred reward. However, and arguably more importantly, we are also able to identify reasonable assumptions under which the reward inference error can be bounded linearly in the error in the human model.

    "abstract": "While recent camera-only 3D detection methods leverage multiple timesteps, the limited history they use significantly hampers the extent to which temporal fusion can improve object perception. Observing that existing works' fusion of multi-frame images are instances of temporal stereo matching, we find that performance is hindered by the interplay between 1) the low granularity of matching resolution and 2) the sub-optimal multi-view setup produced by limited history usage. Our theoretical and empirical analysis demonstrates that the optimal temporal difference between views varies significantly for different pixels and depths, making it necessary to fuse many timesteps over long-term history. Building on our investigation, we propose to generate a cost volume from a long history of image observations, compensating for the coarse but efficient matching resolution with a more optimal multi-view matching setup. Further, we augment the per-frame monocular depth predictions used for long-term, coarse matching with short-term, fine-grained matching and find that long and short term temporal fusion are highly complementary. While maintaining high efficiency, our framework sets new state-of-the-art on nuScenes, achieving first place on the test set and outperforming previous best art by 5.2% mAP and 3.7% NDS on the validation set.

    "abstract": "Future- or return-conditioned supervised learning is an emerging paradigm for offline reinforcement learning (RL), in which the future outcome (i.e., return) associated with a sequence of actions in an offline dataset is used as input to a policy trained to imitate those same actions. While return-conditioning is at the heart of popular algorithms such as decision transformer (DT), these methods tend to perform poorly in highly stochastic environments, where an occasional high return associated with a sequence of actions may be due more to the randomness of the environment than to the actions themselves. Such situations can lead to a learned policy that is inconsistent with its conditioning inputs; i.e., using the policy – while conditioned on a specific desired return – to act in the environment can lead to a distribution of real returns that is wildly different than desired. In this work, we propose the dichotomy of control (DoC), a future-conditioned supervised learning framework that separates mechanisms within a policy's control (actions) from those outside of a policy's control (environment stochasticity). We achieve this by conditioning the policy on a latent variable representation of the future and designing a mutual information constraint that removes any future information from the latent variable that is only due to randomness of the environment. Theoretically, we show that DoC yields policies that are consistent with their conditioning inputs, ensuring that conditioning a learned policy on a desired high-return future outcome will correctly induce high-return behavior. Empirically, we show that DoC is able to achieve significantly better performance than DT on environments with highly stochastic rewards (e.g., Bandit) and transitions (e.g., FrozenLake)",

This framework provides an appealing trade-off between the efficiency of constraint-free neural inference and the prohibitive cost of exhaustive reasoning at inference time.

We further study popular methods and introduce variations of them, allowing us to relate this theoretical result to current practices and show the influence (or lack thereof) of design choices on downstream performance. Motivated by our equivalence result, we investigate the low performance of SimCLR and show how it can match VICReg's with careful hyperparameter tuning, improving significantly over known baselines.

Our theoretical and quantitative results suggest that the numerical gaps between contrastive and non-contrastive methods in certain regimes can be closed given better network design choices and hyperparameter tuning.

    "volume": "oral",
    "abstract": "Recent breakthroughs in text-to-image synthesis have been driven by diffusion models trained on billions of image-text pairs. Adapting this approach to 3D synthesis would require large-scale datasets of labeled 3D or multiview data and efficient architectures for denoising 3D data, neither of which currently exist. In this work, we circumvent these limitations by using a pretrained 2D text-to-image diffusion model to perform text-to-3D synthesis. We introduce a loss based on probability density distillation that enables the use of a 2D diffusion model as a prior for optimization of a parametric image generator. Using this loss in a DeepDream-like procedure, we optimize a randomly-initialized 3D model (a Neural Radiance Field, or NeRF) via gradient descent such that its 2D renderings from random angles achieve a low loss. The resulting 3D model of the given text can be viewed from any angle, relit by arbitrary illumination, or composited into any 3D environment. Our approach requires no 3D training data and no modifications to the image diffusion model, demonstrating the effectiveness of pretrained image diffusion models as priors",

    "title": "Universal Few-shot Learning of Dense Prediction Tasks with Visual Token Matching",
    "volume": "oral",
    "abstract": "Dense prediction tasks are a fundamental class of problems in computer vision. As supervised methods suffer from high pixel-wise labeling cost, a few-shot learning solution that can learn any dense task from a few labeled images is desired. Yet, current few-shot learning methods target a restricted set of tasks such as semantic segmentation, presumably due to challenges in designing a general and unified model that is able to flexibly and efficiently adapt to arbitrary tasks of unseen semantics. We propose Visual Token Matching (VTM), a universal few-shot learner for arbitrary dense prediction tasks. It employs non-parametric matching on patch-level embedded tokens of images and labels that encapsulates all tasks. Also, VTM flexibly adapts to any task with a tiny amount of task-specific parameters that modulate the matching algorithm. We implement VTM as a powerful hierarchical encoder-decoder architecture involving ViT backbones where token matching is performed at multiple feature hierarchies. We experiment VTM on a challenging variant of Taskonomy dataset and observe that it robustly few-shot learns various unseen dense prediction tasks. Surprisingly, it is competitive with fully supervised baselines using only 10 labeled examples of novel tasks ($0.004\\%$ of full supervision) and sometimes outperforms using $0.1\\%$ of full supervision.

    "abstract": "Many machine learning problems today have multiple objective functions. They appear either in learning with multiple criteria where learning has to make a trade-off between multiple performance metrics such as fairness, safety and accuracy; or, in multi-task learning where multiple tasks are optimized jointly, sharing inductive bias between them. This problems are often tackled by the multi-objective optimization framework. However, existing stochastic multi-objective gradient methods and its variants (e.g., MGDA, PCGrad, CAGrad, etc.) all adopt a biased noisy gradient direction, which leads to degraded empirical performance. To this end, we develop a stochastic multi-objective gradient correction (MoCo) method for multi-objective optimization. The unique feature of our method is that it can guarantee convergence without increasing the batch size even in the nonconvex setting. Simulations on multi-task supervised and reinforcement learning demonstrate the effectiveness of our method relative to the state-of-the-art methods",

In this paper, we explore the use of LLMs to generate both reasoning traces and task-specific actions in an interleaved manner, allowing for greater synergy between the two: reasoning traces help the model induce, track, and update action plans as well as handle exceptions, while actions allow it to interface with external sources, such as knowledge bases or environments, to gather additional information. We apply our approach, named ReAct, to a diverse set of language and decision making tasks and demonstrate its effectiveness over state-of-the-art baselines, as well as improved human interpretability and trustworthiness over methods without reasoning or acting components. Concretely, on question answering (HotpotQA) and fact verification (Fever), ReAct overcomes issues of hallucination and error propagation prevalent in chain-of-thought reasoning by interacting with a simple Wikipedia API, and generates human-like task-solving trajectories that are more interpretable than baselines without reasoning traces. On two interactive decision making benchmarks (ALFWorld and WebShop), ReAct outperforms imitation and reinforcement learning methods by an absolute success rate of 34% and 10% respectively, while being prompted with only one or two in-context examples",

We investigate whether these methods can directly address the problem of sequential decision-making. We view decision-making not through the lens of reinforcement learning (RL), but rather through conditional generative modeling. To our surprise, we find that our formulation leads to policies that can outperform existing offline RL approaches across standard benchmarks. By modeling a policy as a return-conditional generative model, we avoid the need for dynamic programming and subsequently eliminate many of the complexities that come with traditional offline RL. We further demonstrate the advantages of modeling policies as conditional generative models by considering two other conditioning variables: constraints and skills. Conditioning on a single constraint or skill during training leads to behaviors at test-time that can satisfy several constraints together or demonstrate a composition of skills. Our results illustrate that conditional generative modeling is a powerful tool for decision-making",

    "title": "The Lie Derivative for Measuring Learned Equivariance",
    "volume": "oral",
    "abstract": "Equivariance guarantees that a model's predictions capture key symmetries in data. When an image is translated or rotated, an equivariant model's representation of that image will translate or rotate accordingly. The success of convolutional neural networks has historically been tied to translation equivariance directly encoded in their architecture. The rising success of vision transformers, which have no explicit architectural bias towards equivariance, challenges this narrative and suggests that augmentations and training data might also play a significant role in their performance. In order to better understand the role of equivariance in recent vision models, we apply the Lie derivative, a method for measuring equivariance with strong mathematical foundations and minimal hyperparameters. Using the Lie derivative, we study the equivariance properties of hundreds of pretrained models, spanning CNNs, transformers, and Mixer architectures. The scale of our analysis allows us to separate the impact of architecture from other factors like model size or training method. Surprisingly, we find that many violations of equivariance can be linked to spatial aliasing in ubiquitous network layers, such as pointwise non-linearities, and that as models get larger and more accurate they tend to display more equivariance, regardless of architecture. For example, transformers can be more equivariant than convolutional neural networks after training",

    "abstract": "Gradient-based learning algorithms have an implicit \\emph{simplicity bias} which in effect can limit the diversity of predictors being sampled by the learning procedure. This behavior can hinder the transferability of trained models by (i) favoring the learning of simpler but spurious features --- present in the training data but absent from the test data --- and (ii) by only leveraging a small subset of predictive features. Such an effect is especially magnified when the test distribution does not exactly match the train distribution---referred to as the Out of Distribution (OOD) generalization problem. However, given only the training data, it is not always possible to apriori assess if a given feature is spurious or transferable. Instead, we advocate for learning an ensemble of models which capture a diverse set of predictive features. Towards this, we propose a new algorithm D-BAT (Diversity-By-disAgreement Training), which enforces agreement among the models on the training data, but disagreement on the OOD data. We show how D-BAT naturally emerges from the notion of generalized discrepancy, as well as demonstrate in multiple experiments how the proposed method can mitigate shortcut-learning, enhance uncertainty and OOD detection, as well as improve transferability",

    "title": "Efficient Conditionally Invariant Representation Learning",

    "abstract": "We introduce the Conditional Independence Regression CovariancE (CIRCE), a measure of conditional independence for multivariate continuous-valued variables. CIRCE applies as a regularizer in settings where we wish to learn neural features $\\varphi(X)$ of data $X$ to estimate a target $Y$, while being conditionally independent of a distractor $Z$ given $Y$. Both $Z$ and $Y$ are assumed to be continuous-valued but relatively low dimensional, whereas $X$ and its features may be complex and high dimensional. Relevant settings include domain-invariant learning, fairness, and causal learning. The procedure requires just a single ridge regression from $Y$ to kernelized features of $Z$, which can be done in advance. It is then only necessary to enforce independence of $\\varphi(X)$ from residuals of this regression, which is possible with attractive estimation properties and consistency guarantees. By contrast, earlier measures of conditional feature dependence require multiple regressions for each step of feature learning, resulting in more severe bias and variance, and greater computational cost. When sufficiently rich features are used, we establish that CIRCE is zero if and only if $\\varphi(X) \\perp \\!\\!\\! \\perp Z \\mid Y$.

    "volume": "oral",
    "abstract": "While some state-of-the-art artificial neural network systems in computer vision are strikingly accurate models of the corresponding primate visual processing, there are still many discrepancies between these models and the behavior of primates on object recognition tasks. Many current models suffer from extreme sensitivity to adversarial attacks and often do not align well with the image-by-image behavioral error patterns observed in humans. Previous research has provided strong evidence that primate object recognition behavior can be very accurately predicted by neural population activity in the inferior temporal (IT) cortex, a brain area in the late stages of the visual processing hierarchy. Therefore, here we directly test whether making the late stage representations of models more similar to that of macaque IT produces new models that exhibit more robust, primate-like behavior. We conducted chronic, large-scale multi-electrode recordings across the IT cortex in six non-human primates (rhesus macaques). We then use these data to fine-tune (end-to-end) the model \"IT\" representations such that they are more aligned with the biological IT representations, while preserving accuracy on object recognition tasks. We generate a cohort of models with a range of IT similarity scores validated on held-out animals across two image sets with distinct statistics. Across a battery of optimization conditions, we observed a strong correlation between the models' IT-likeness and alignment with human behavior, as well as an increase in its adversarial robustness. We further assessed the limitations of this approach and find that the improvements in behavioral alignment and adversarial robustness generalize across different image statistics, but not to object categories outside of those covered in our IT training set. Taken together, our results demonstrate that building models that are more aligned with the primate brain leads to more robust and human-like behavior, and call for larger neural data-sets to further augment these gains",

We investigate this question in the setting of learning automata, discrete dynamical systems naturally suited to recurrent modeling and expressing algorithmic tasks. Our theoretical results completely characterize shortcut solutions, whereby a shallow Transformer with only $o(T)$ layers can exactly replicate the computation of an automaton on an input sequence of length $T$. By representing automata using the algebraic structure of their underlying transformation semigroups, we obtain $O(\\log T)$-depth simulators for all automata and $O(1)$-depth simulators for all automata whose associated groups are solvable.

In light of this, we propose a Selection-Inference (SI) framework that exploits pre-trained LLMs as general processing modules, and alternates between selection and inference to generate a series of interpretable, casual reasoning steps leading to the final answer. We show that a 7B parameter LLM used within the SI framework in a 5-shot generalisation setting, with no fine-tuning, yields a performance improvement of over 100% compared to an equivalent vanilla baseline on a suite of 10 logical reasoning tasks. The same model in the same setting even outperforms a significantly larger 280B parameter baseline on the same suite of tasks.

We address these issues by instead providing a certificate that demonstrates that the learning algorithm itself is fair, and hence, as a consequence, so too is the trained model. We introduce a method to provide a confidential proof of fairness for training, in the context of widely used decision trees, which we term Confidential-PROFITT. We propose novel fair decision tree learning algorithms along with customized zero-knowledge proof protocols to obtain a proof of fairness that can be audited by a third party. Using zero-knowledge proofs enables us to guarantee confidentiality of both the model and its training data. We show empirically that bounding the information gain of each node with respect to the sensitive attributes reduces the unfairness of the final tree. In extensive experiments on the COMPAS, Communities and Crime, Default Credit, and Adult datasets, we demonstrate that a company can use Confidential-PROFITT to certify the fairness of their decision tree to an auditor in less than 2 minutes, thus indicating the applicability of our approach. This is true for both the demographic parity and equalized odds definitions of fairness. Finally, we extend Confidential-PROFITT to apply to ensembles of trees",

We focus on the $\\epsilon$-coreset for robust clustering, a small proxy of the dataset that preserves the clustering cost within $\\epsilon$-relative error for all center sets. Our main result is an $\\epsilon$-coreset of size $O(m + \\mathrm{poly}(k \\epsilon^{-1}))$ that can be constructed in near-linear time. This significantly improves previous results, which either suffers an exponential dependence on $(m + k)$ [Feldman and Schulman, SODA'12], or has a weaker bi-criteria guarantee [Huang et al., FOCS'18]. Furthermore, we show this dependence in $m$ is nearly-optimal, and the fact that it is isolated from other factors may be crucial for dealing with large number of outliers. We construct our coresets by adapting to the outlier setting a recent framework [Braverman et al., FOCS'22] which was designed for capacity-constrained clustering, overcoming a new challenge that the participating terms in the cost, particularly the excluded $m$ outlier points, are dependent on the center set $C$.

    "volume": "oral",
    "abstract": "Random-feature-based attention (RFA) is an efficient approximation of softmax attention with linear runtime and space complexity. However, the approximation gap between RFA and conventional softmax attention is not well studied. Built upon previous progress of RFA, we characterize this gap through the lens of control variates and show that RFA can be decomposed into a sum of multiple control variate estimators for each element in the sequence. This new framework reveals that exact softmax attention can be recovered from RFA by manipulating each control variate. Besides, it allows us to develop a more flexible form of control variates, resulting in a novel attention mechanism that significantly reduces the approximation gap while maintaining linear complexity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model outperforms state-of-the-art efficient attention mechanisms on both vision and language tasks",

    "title": "Moving Forward by Moving Backward: Embedding Action Impact over Action Semantics",
    "volume": "oral",
    "abstract": "A common assumption when training embodied agents is that the impact of taking an action is stable; for instance, executing the ``move ahead'' action will always move the agent forward by a fixed distance, perhaps with some small amount of actuator-induced noise. This assumption is limiting; an agent may encounter settings that dramatically alter the impact of actions: a move ahead action on a wet floor may send the agent twice as far as it expects and using the same action with a broken wheel might transform the expected translation into a rotation. Instead of relying that the impact of an action stably reflects its pre-defined semantic meaning, we propose to model the impact of actions on-the-fly using latent embeddings. By combining these latent action embeddings with a novel, transformer-based, policy head, we design an Action Adaptive Policy (AAP). We evaluate our AAP on two challenging visual navigation tasks in the AI2-THOR and Habitat environments and show that our AAP is highly performant even when faced, at inference-time, with missing actions and, previously unseen, perturbed action spaces. Moreover, we observe significant improvement in robustness against these actions when evaluating in real-world scenarios",

    "title": "Graph Neural Networks for Link Prediction with Subgraph Sketching",
    "volume": "oral",
    "abstract": "Many Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) perform poorly compared to simple heuristics on Link Prediction (LP) tasks. This is due to limitations in expressive power such as the inability to count triangles (the backbone of most LP heuristics) and because they can not distinguish automorphic nodes (those having identical structural roles). Both expressiveness issues can be alleviated by learning link (rather than node) representations and incorporating structural features such as triangle counts. Since explicit link representations are often prohibitively expensive, recent works resorted to subgraph-based methods, which have achieved state-of-the-art performance for LP, but suffer from poor efficiency due to high levels of redundancy between subgraphs. We analyze the components of subgraph GNN (SGNN) methods for link prediction. Based on our analysis, we propose a novel full-graph GNN called ELPH (Efficient Link Prediction with Hashing) that passes subgraph sketches as messages to approximate the key components of SGNNs without explicit subgraph construction. ELPH is provably more expressive than Message Passing GNNs (MPNNs). It outperforms existing SGNN models on many standard LP benchmarks while being orders of magnitude faster. However, it shares the common GNN limitation that it is only efficient when the dataset fits in GPU memory. Accordingly, we develop a highly scalable model, called BUDDY, which uses feature precomputation to circumvent this limitation without sacrificing predictive performance. Our experiments show that BUDDY also outperforms SGNNs on standard LP benchmarks while being highly scalable and faster than ELPH",

Methods that predict a single point estimate do not predict the pose of objects with symmetries well and cannot represent uncertainty. Alternatively, some works predict a distribution over orientations in $\\mathrm{SO}(3)$. However, training such models can be computation- and sample-inefficient. Instead, we propose a novel mapping of features from the image domain to the 3D rotation manifold. Our method then leverages $\\mathrm{SO}(3)$ equivariant layers, which are more sample efficient, and outputs a distribution over rotations that can be sampled at arbitrary resolution. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method at object orientation prediction, and achieve state-of-the-art performance on the popular PASCAL3D+ dataset.

And they do not allow for targeted modeling of local features as CNN structures do. To solve the above problems, we propose to combine local features and global correlations to capture the overall view of time series (e.g., fluctuations, trends). To fully exploit the underlying information in the time series, a multi-scale branch structure is adopted to model different potential patterns separately. Each pattern is extracted with down-sampled convolution and isometric convolution for local features and global correlations, respectively. In addition to being more effective, our proposed method, termed as Multi-scale Isometric Convolution Network (MICN), is more efficient with linear complexity about the sequence length with suitable convolution kernels. Our experiments on six benchmark datasets show that compared with state-of-the-art methods, MICN yields 17.2% and 21.6% relative improvements for multivariate and univariate time series, respectively",

In this work, we conduct explicit local-global feature alignment by leveraging global semantic knowledge for learning a better representation.

In contrast to the empirical success reported in prior works, the working mechanism of crossmodal KD remains a mystery. In this paper, we present a thorough understanding of crossmodal KD. We begin by providing two failure cases and demonstrate that KD is not a universal cure in crossmodal knowledge transfer. We then present the modality Venn diagram to understand modality relationships and the modality focusing hypothesis revealing the decisive factor in the efficacy of crossmodal KD.

    "volume": "oral",
    "abstract": "Variational autoencoders (VAEs) are powerful tools for learning latent representations of data used in a wide range of applications. In practice, VAEs usually require multiple training rounds to choose the amount of information the latent variable should retain. This trade-off between the reconstruction error (distortion) and the KL divergence (rate) is typically parameterized by a hyperparameter $\\beta$. In this paper, we introduce Multi-Rate VAE (MR-VAE), a computationally efficient framework for learning optimal parameters corresponding to various $\\beta$ in a single training run. The key idea is to explicitly formulate a response function using hypernetworks that maps $\\beta$ to the optimal parameters. MR-VAEs construct a compact response hypernetwork where the pre-activations are conditionally gated based on $\\beta$. We justify the proposed architecture by analyzing linear VAEs and showing that it can represent response functions exactly for linear VAEs. With the learned hypernetwork, MR-VAEs can construct the rate-distortion curve without additional training and can be deployed with significantly less hyperparameter tuning. Empirically, our approach is competitive and often exceeds the performance of multiple $\\beta$-VAEs training with minimal computation and memory overheads",

We propose the AE-LSVI algorithm for best policy identification, a novel variant of the kernelized least-squares value iteration (LSVI) algorithm that combines optimism with pessimism for active exploration (AE). AE-LSVI provably identifies a near-optimal policy \\emph{uniformly} over an entire state space and achieves polynomial sample complexity guarantees that are independent of the number of states. When specialized to the recently introduced offline contextual Bayesian optimization setting, our algorithm achieves improved sample complexity bounds.

    "abstract": "Antibody design is valuable for therapeutic usage and biological research. Existing deep-learning-based methods encounter several key issues: 1) incomplete context for Complementarity-Determining Regions (CDRs) generation; 2) incapability of capturing the entire 3D geometry of the input structure; 3) inefficient prediction of the CDR sequences in an autoregressive manner. In this paper, we propose Multi-channel Equivariant Attention Network (MEAN) to co-design 1D sequences and 3D structures of CDRs. To be specific, MEAN formulates antibody design as a conditional graph translation problem by importing extra components including the target antigen and the light chain of the antibody. Then, MEAN resorts to E(3)-equivariant message passing along with a proposed attention mechanism to better capture the geometrical correlation between different components. Finally, it outputs both the 1D sequences and 3D structure via a multi-round progressive full-shot scheme, which enjoys more efficiency and precision against previous autoregressive approaches. Our method significantly surpasses state-of-the-art models in sequence and structure modeling, antigen-binding CDR design, and binding affinity optimization. Specifically, the relative improvement to baselines is about 23\\% in antigen-binding CDR design and 34\\% for affinity optimization",

Although the network has no a priori knowledge of the game or its rules, we uncover evidence of an emergent nonlinear internal representation of the board state.

    "title": "Tailoring Language Generation Models under Total Variation Distance",
    "volume": "oral",
    "abstract": "The standard paradigm of neural language generation adopts maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) as the optimizing method. From a distributional view, MLE in fact minimizes the Kullback-Leibler divergence (KLD) between the distribution of the real data and that of the model. However, this approach forces the model to distribute non-zero (sometimes large) probability mass to all training samples regardless of their quality. Moreover, in the attempt to cover the low-probability regions in the data distribution, the model systematically overestimates the probability of corrupted text sequences, which we conjecture is one of the main reasons for text degeneration during autoregressive decoding. To remedy this problem, we leverage the total variation distance (TVD) with its robustness to outliers, and develop practical bounds to apply it to language generation. Then, we introduce the TaiLr objective that balances the tradeoff of estimating TVD. Intuitively, TaiLr downweights real data samples that have low model probabilities with tunable penalization intensity. Experimental results show that our method alleviates the overestimation of degenerated sequences without sacrificing diversity and improves generation quality on a wide range of text generation tasks",

    "abstract": "Deep reinforcement learning agents are notoriously sample inefficient, which considerably limits their application to real-world problems. Recently, many model-based methods have been designed to address this issue, with learning in the imagination of a world model being one of the most prominent approaches. However, while virtually unlimited interaction with a simulated environment sounds appealing, the world model has to be accurate over extended periods of time. Motivated by the success of Transformers in sequence modeling tasks, we introduce IRIS, a data-efficient agent that learns in a world model composed of a discrete autoencoder and an autoregressive Transformer. With the equivalent of only two hours of gameplay in the Atari 100k benchmark, IRIS achieves a mean human normalized score of 1.046, and outperforms humans on 10 out of 26 games, setting a new state of the art for methods without lookahead search.

    "title": "Statistical Efficiency of Score Matching: The View from Isoperimetry",
    "volume": "oral",
    "abstract": "Deep generative models parametrized up to a normalizing constant (e.g. energy-based models) are difficult to train by maximizing the likelihood of the data because the likelihood and/or gradients thereof cannot be explicitly or efficiently written down. Score matching is a training method, whereby instead of fitting the likelihood $\\log p(x)$ for the training data, we instead fit the score function $\\nabla_x \\log p(x)$ --- obviating the need to evaluate the partition function. Though this estimator is known to be consistent, its unclear whether (and when) its statistical efficiency is comparable to that of maximum likelihood --- which is known to be (asymptotically) optimal. We initiate this line of inquiry in this paper, and show a tight connection between statistical efficiency of score matching and the isoperimetric properties of the distribution being estimated --- i.e. the Poincar\\'e, log-Sobolev and isoperimetric constant --- quantities which govern the mixing time of Markov processes like Langevin dynamics. Roughly, we show that the score matching estimator is statistically comparable to the maximum likelihood when the distribution has a small isoperimetric constant. Conversely, if the distribution has a large isoperimetric constant --- even for simple families of distributions like exponential families with rich enough sufficient statistics --- score matching will be substantially less efficient than maximum likelihood. We suitably formalize these results both in the finite sample regime, and in the asymptotic regime. Finally, we identify a direct parallel in the discrete setting, where we connect the statistical properties of pseudolikelihood estimation with approximate tensorization of entropy and the Glauber dynamics",

In many recent works such as NeRF (Mildenhall et al., 2020), the scene geometry is parameterized using neural implicit representations (i.e., MLPs). Implicit neural representations have achieved impressive visual quality but have drawbacks in computational efficiency. In this work, we propose a new approach that performs view synthesis using point clouds. It is the first point-based method that achieves better visual quality than NeRF while being 100× faster in rendering speed. Our approach builds on existing works on differentiable point-based rendering but introduces a novel technique we call \"Sculpted Neural Points (SNP)\", which significantly improves the robustness to errors and holes in the reconstructed point cloud. We further propose to use view-dependent point features based on spherical harmonics to capture non-Lambertian surfaces, and new designs in the point-based rendering pipeline that further boost the performance.

    "abstract": "Although Transformer architectures have been successfully applied to graph data with the advent of Graph Transformer, current design of Graph Transformer still heavily relies on human labor and expertise knowledge to decide proper neural architectures and suitable graph encoding strategies at each Transformer layer. In literature, there have been some works on automated design of Transformers focusing on non-graph data such as texts and images without considering graph encoding strategies, which fail to handle the non-euclidean graph data. In this paper, we study the problem of automated graph Transformer, for the first time. However, solving these problems poses the following challenges: i) how can we design a unified search space for graph Transformer, and ii) how to deal with the coupling relations between Transformer architectures and the graph encodings of each Transformer layer. To address these challenges, we propose Automated Graph Transformer (AutoGT), a neural architecture search framework that can automatically discover the optimal graph Transformer architectures by joint optimization of Transformer architecture and graph encoding strategies. Specifically, we first propose a unified graph Transformer formulation that can represent most of state-of-the-art graph Transformer architectures. Based upon the unified formulation, we further design the graph Transformer search space that includes both candidate architectures and various graph encodings. To handle the coupling relations, we propose a novel encoding-aware performance estimation strategy by gradually training and splitting the supernets according to the correlations between graph encodings and architectures. The proposed strategy can provide a more consistent and fine-grained performance prediction when evaluating the jointly optimized graph encodings and architectures. Extensive experiments and ablation studies show that our proposed AutoGT gains sufficient improvement over state-of-the-art hand-crafted baselines on all datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness and wide applicability",

To fill the gap, we propose Crossformer, a Transformer-based model utilizing cross-dimension dependency for MTS forecasting. In Crossformer, the input MTS is embedded into a 2D vector array through the Dimension-Segment-Wise (DSW) embedding to preserve time and dimension information. Then the Two-Stage Attention (TSA) layer is proposed to efficiently capture the cross-time and cross-dimension dependency. Utilizing DSW embedding and TSA layer, Crossformer establishes a Hierarchical Encoder-Decoder (HED) to use the information at different scales for the final forecasting.

However, gradients in MLO, which are obtained by composing best-response Jacobians via the chain rule, are notoriously difficult to implement and memory/compute intensive. We take an initial step towards closing this gap by introducing Betty, a software library for large-scale MLO. At its core, we devise a novel dataflow graph for MLO, which allows us to (1) develop efficient automatic differentiation for MLO that reduces the computational complexity from $\\mathcal{O}(d^3)$ to $\\mathcal{O}(d^2)$, (2) incorporate systems support such as mixed-precision and data-parallel training for scalability, and (3) facilitate implementation of MLO programs of arbitrary complexity while allowing a modular interface for diverse algorithmic and systems design choices. We empirically demonstrate that Betty can be used to implement an array of MLO programs, while also observing up to 11% increase in test accuracy, 14% decrease in GPU memory usage, and 20% decrease in training wall time over existing implementations on multiple benchmarks. We also showcase that Betty enables scaling MLO to models with hundreds of millions of parameters. We open-source the code at https://github.com/leopard-ai/betty",

    "title": "Offline RL with No OOD Actions: In-Sample Learning via Implicit Value Regularization",
    "volume": "oral",
    "abstract": "Most offline reinforcement learning (RL) methods suffer from the trade-off between improving the policy to surpass the behavior policy and constraining the policy to limit the deviation from the behavior policy as computing $Q$-values using out-of-distribution (OOD) actions will suffer from errors due to distributional shift. The recent proposed \\textit{In-sample Learning} paradigm (i.e., IQL), which improves the policy by quantile regression using only data samples, shows great promise because it learns an optimal policy without querying the value function of any unseen actions. However, it remains unclear how this type of method handles the distributional shift in learning the value function. In this work, we make a key finding that the in-sample learning paradigm arises under the \\textit{Implicit Value Regularization} (IVR) framework. This gives a deeper understanding of why the in-sample learning paradigm works, i.e., it applies implicit value regularization to the policy. Based on the IVR framework, we further propose two practical algorithms, Sparse $Q$-learning (SQL) and Exponential $Q$-learning (EQL), which adopt the same value regularization used in existing works, but in a complete in-sample manner. Compared with IQL, we find that our algorithms introduce sparsity in learning the value function, making them more robust in noisy data regimes. We also verify the effectiveness of SQL and EQL on D4RL benchmark datasets and show the benefits of in-sample learning by comparing them with CQL in small data regimes.

    "abstract": "Training deep networks on large-scale datasets is computationally challenging. In this work, we explore the problem of ``\\textit{how to accelerate adaptive gradient algorithms in a general manner}\", and aim to provide practical efficiency-boosting insights. To this end, we propose an effective and general {Weight-decay-Integrated Nesterov acceleration} (Win) to accelerate adaptive algorithms. Taking AdamW and Adam as examples, we minimize a dynamical loss per iteration which combines the vanilla training loss and a dynamic regularizer inspired by proximal point method (PPM) to improve the convexity of the problem. To introduce Nesterov-alike-acceleration into AdamW and Adam, we respectively use the first- and second-order Taylor approximations of vanilla loss to update the variable twice. In this way, we arrive at our Win acceleration for AdamW and Adam that uses a conservative step and a reckless step to update twice and then linearly combines these two updates for acceleration. Next, we extend Win acceleration to LAMB and SGD. Our transparent acceleration derivation could provide insights for other accelerated methods and their integration into adaptive algorithms. Besides, we prove the convergence of Win-accelerated adaptive algorithms and justify their convergence superiority over their non-accelerated counterparts by taking AdamW and Adam as examples. Experimental results testify to the faster convergence speed and superior performance of our Win-accelerated AdamW, Adam, LAMB and SGD over their non-accelerated counterparts on vision classification tasks and language modeling tasks with both CNN and Transformer backbones. We hope Win shall be a default acceleration option for popular optimizers in deep learning community to improve the training efficiency.

    "title": "Towards Stable Test-time Adaptation in Dynamic Wild World",
    "volume": "oral",
    "abstract": "Test-time adaptation (TTA) has shown to be effective at tackling distribution shifts between training and testing data by adapting a given model on test samples. However, the online model updating of TTA may be unstable and this is often a key obstacle preventing existing TTA methods from being deployed in the real world. Specifically, TTA may fail to improve or even harm the model performance when test data have: 1) mixed distribution shifts, 2) small batch sizes, and 3) online imbalanced label distribution shifts, which are quite common in practice. In this paper, we investigate the unstable reasons and find that the batch norm layer is a crucial factor hindering TTA stability. Conversely, TTA can perform more stably with batch-agnostic norm layers, i.e., group or layer norm. However, we observe that TTA with group and layer norms does not always succeed and still suffers many failure cases. By digging into the failure cases, we find that certain noisy test samples with large gradients may disturb the model adaption and result in collapsed trivial solutions, i.e., assigning the same class label for all samples. To address the above collapse issue, we propose a sharpness-aware and reliable entropy minimization method, called SAR, for further stabilizing TTA from two aspects: 1) remove partial noisy samples with large gradients, 2) encourage model weights to go to a flat minimum so that the model is robust to the remaining noisy samples. Promising results demonstrate that SAR performs more stably than prior methods and is computationally efficient under the above wild test scenarios",

To address these issues, we propose MocoSFL, a collaborative SSL framework based on Split Federated Learning (SFL) and Momentum Contrast (MoCo). In MocoSFL, the large backbone model is split into a small client-side model and a large server-side model, and only the small client-side model is processed locally on the client's local devices. MocoSFL has three key components: (i) vector concatenation which enables the use of small batch size and reduces computation and memory requirements by orders of magnitude; (ii) feature sharing that helps achieve high accuracy regardless of the quality and volume of local data; (iii) frequent synchronization that helps achieve better non-IID performance because of smaller local model divergence.

In this work, we develop a 3D generator with Generic Priors (3DGP): a 3D synthesis framework with more general assumptions about the training data, and show that it scales to very challenging datasets, like ImageNet.

Then, we create a flexible camera model and a regularization strategy for it to learn its distribution parameters during training.

It achieves more stable training than the existing methods and speeds up the convergence by at least 40%.

While numerous approaches have been proposed to improve GNNs with respect to the Weisfeiler-Lehman (WL) test, for most of them, there is still a lack of deep understanding of what additional power they can systematically and provably gain. In this paper, we take a fundamentally different perspective to study the expressive power of GNNs beyond the WL test. Specifically, we introduce a novel class of expressivity metrics via graph biconnectivity and highlight their importance in both theory and practice. As biconnectivity can be easily calculated using simple algorithms that have linear computational costs, it is natural to expect that popular GNNs can learn it easily as well. However, after a thorough review of prior GNN architectures, we surprisingly find that most of them are not expressive for any of these metrics. The only exception is the ESAN framework (Bevilacqua et al., 2022), for which we give a theoretical justification of its power. We proceed to introduce a principled and more efficient approach, called the Generalized Distance Weisfeiler-Lehman (GD-WL), which is provably expressive for all biconnectivity metrics. Practically, we show GD-WL can be implemented by a Transformer-like architecture that preserves expressiveness and enjoys full parallelizability. A set of experiments on both synthetic and real datasets demonstrates that our approach can consistently outperform prior GNN architectures",

    "abstract": "What is an image, and how to extract latent features? Convolutional Networks (ConvNets) consider an image as organized pixels in a rectangular shape and extract features via convolutional operation in a local region; Vision Transformers (ViTs) treat an image as a sequence of patches and extract features via attention mechanism in a global range. In this work, we introduce a straightforward and promising paradigm for visual representation, which is called Context Clusters. Context clusters (CoCs) view an image as a set of unorganized points and extract features via a simplified clustering algorithm. In detail, each point includes the raw feature (e.g., color) and positional information (e.g., coordinates), and a simplified clustering algorithm is employed to group and extract deep features hierarchically. Our CoCs are convolution- and attention-free, only relying on clustering algorithm for spatial interaction. Owing to the simple design, we show CoCs endow gratifying interpretability via the visualization of the clustering process. Our CoCs aim at providing a new perspective on image and visual representation, which may enjoy broad applications in different domains and exhibit profound insights. Even though we are not targeting SOTA performance, COCs still achieve comparable or even better performance than ConvNets or ViTs on several benchmarks",

    "title": "Human-Guided Fair Classification for Natural Language Processing",
    "volume": "spotlight",
    "abstract": "Text classifiers have promising applications in high-stake tasks such as resume screening and content moderation. These classifiers must be fair and avoid discriminatory decisions by being invariant to perturbations of sensitive attributes such as gender or ethnicity. However, there is a gap between human intuition about these perturbations and the formal similarity specifications capturing them. While existing research has started to address this gap, current methods are based on hardcoded word replacements, resulting in specifications with limited expressivity or ones that fail to fully align with human intuition (e.g., in cases of asymmetric counterfactuals). This work proposes novel methods for bridging this gap by discovering expressive and intuitive individual fairness specifications. We show how to leverage unsupervised style transfer and GPT-3's zero-shot capabilities to automatically generate expressive candidate pairs of semantically similar sentences that differ along sensitive attributes. We then validate the generated pairs via an extensive crowdsourcing study, which confirms that a lot of these pairs align with human intuition about fairness in the context of toxicity classification. Finally, we show how limited amounts of human feedback can be leveraged to learn a similarity specification that can be used to train downstream fairness-aware models",

    "title": "Humanly Certifying Superhuman Classifiers",
    "volume": "spotlight",
    "abstract": "This paper addresses a key question in current machine learning research: if we believe that a model's predictions might be better than those given by human experts, how can we (humans) verify these beliefs? In some cases, this ``superhuman'' performance is readily demonstrated; for example by defeating top-tier human players in traditional two player games. On the other hand, it can be challenging to evaluate classification models that potentially surpass human performance. Indeed, human annotations are often treated as a ground truth, which implicitly assumes the superiority of the human over any models trained on human annotations. In reality, human annotators are subjective and can make mistakes. Evaluating the performance with respect to a genuine oracle is more objective and reliable, even when querying the oracle is more expensive or sometimes impossible. In this paper, we first raise the challenge of evaluating the performance of both humans and models with respect to an oracle which is $\\textit{unobserved}$. We develop a theory for estimating the accuracy compared to the oracle, using only imperfect human annotations for reference. Our analysis provides an executable recipe for detecting and certifying superhuman performance in this setting, which we believe will assist in understanding the stage of current research on classification. We validate the convergence of the bounds and the assumptions of our theory on carefully designed toy experiments with known oracles. Moreover, we demonstrate the utility of our theory by meta-analyzing large-scale natural language processing tasks, for which an oracle does not exist, and show that under our mild assumptions a number of models from recent years have already achieved superhuman performance with high probability---suggesting that our new oracle based performance evaluation metrics are overdue as an alternative to the widely used accuracy metrics that are naively based on imperfect human annotations",

    "title": "Few-Shot Domain Adaptation For End-to-End Communication",
    "volume": "spotlight",
    "abstract": "The problem of end-to-end learning of a communication system using an autoencoder -- consisting of an encoder, channel, and decoder modeled using neural networks -- has recently been shown to be an effective approach. A challenge faced in the practical adoption of this learning approach is that under changing channel conditions (e.g. a wireless link), it requires frequent retraining of the autoencoder in order to maintain a low decoding error rate. Since retraining is both time consuming and requires a large number of samples, it becomes impractical when the channel distribution is changing quickly. We propose to address this problem using a fast and sample-efficient (few-shot) domain adaptation method that does not change the encoder and decoder networks. Different from conventional training-time unsupervised or semi-supervised domain adaptation, here we have a trained autoencoder from a source distribution that we want to adapt (at test time) to a target distribution using only a small labeled dataset, and no unlabeled data. We focus on a generative channel model based on the Gaussian mixture density network (MDN), and propose a regularized, parameter-efficient adaptation of the MDN using a set of affine transformations. The learned affine transformations are then used to design an optimal transformation at the decoder input to compensate for the distribution shift, and effectively present to the decoder inputs close to the source distribution. Experiments on many simulated distribution changes common to the wireless setting, and a real mmWave FPGA testbed demonstrate the effectiveness of our method at adaptation using very few target domain samples~\\footnote{Code for our work: \\url{https://github.com/jayaram-r/domain-adaptation-autoencoder}}",

    "title": "Learning a Data-Driven Policy Network for Pre-Training Automated Feature Engineering",
    "volume": "spotlight",
    "abstract": "Feature engineering is widely acknowledged to be pivotal in tabular data analysis and prediction. Automated feature engineering (AutoFE) emerged to automate this process managed by experienced data scientists and engineers conventionally. In this area, most — if not all — prior work adopted an identical framework from the neural architecture search (NAS) method. While feasible, we posit that the NAS framework very much contradicts the way how human experts cope with the data since the inherent Markov decision process (MDP) setup differs. We point out that its data-unobserved setup consequentially results in an incapability to generalize across different datasets as well as also high computational cost. This paper proposes a novel AutoFE framework Feature Set Data-Driven Search (FETCH), a pipeline mainly for feature generation and selection. Notably, FETCH is built on a brand-new data-driven MDP setup using the tabular dataset as the state fed into the policy network. Further, we posit that the crucial merit of FETCH is its transferability where the yielded policy network trained on a variety of datasets is indeed capable to enact feature engineering on unseen data, without requiring additional exploration. To the best of our knowledge, this is a pioneer attempt to build a tabular data pre-training paradigm via AutoFE. Extensive experiments show that FETCH systematically surpasses the current state-of-the-art AutoFE methods and validates the transferability of AutoFE pre-training",

These subset sizes are rarely explicitly learned - be it the cluster sizes in clustering applications or the number of shared versus independent generative latent factors in weakly-supervised learning. Probability distributions over correct combinations of subset sizes are non-differentiable due to hard constraints, which prohibit gradient-based optimization. In this work, we propose the differentiable hypergeometric distribution. The hypergeometric distribution models the probability of different group sizes based on their relative importance. We introduce reparameterizable gradients to learn the importance between groups and highlight the advantage of explicitly learning the size of subsets in two typical applications: weakly-supervised learning and clustering. In both applications, we outperform previous approaches, which rely on suboptimal heuristics to model the unknown size of groups",

ProtoPNets compute predictions based on similarity to class-specific part-prototypes learned to recognize parts of training examples, making it easy to faithfully determine what examples are responsible for any target prediction and why. However, like other models, they are prone to picking up confounders and shortcuts from the data, thus suffering from compromised prediction accuracy and limited generalization. We propose ProtoPDebug, an effective concept-level debugger for ProtoPNets in which a human supervisor, guided by the model's explanations, supplies feedback in the form of what part-prototypes must be forgotten or kept, and the model is fine-tuned to align with this supervision. Our experimental evaluation shows that ProtoPDebug outperforms state-of-the-art debuggers for a fraction of the annotation cost. An online experiment with laypeople confirms the simplicity of the feedback requested to the users and the effectiveness of the collected feedback for learning confounder-free part-prototypes. ProtoPDebug is a promising tool for trustworthy interactive learning in critical applications, as suggested by a preliminary evaluation on a medical decision making task",

    "title": "Neuroevolution is a Competitive Alternative to Reinforcement Learning for Skill Discovery",
    "volume": "spotlight",
    "abstract": "Deep Reinforcement Learning (RL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for training neural policies to solve complex control tasks. However, these policies tend to be overfit to the exact specifications of the task and environment they were trained on, and thus do not perform well when conditions deviate slightly or when composed hierarchically to solve even more complex tasks. Recent work has shown that training a mixture of policies, as opposed to a single one, that are driven to explore different regions of the state-action space can address this shortcoming by generating a diverse set of behaviors, referred to as skills, that can be collectively used to great effect in adaptation tasks or for hierarchical planning. This is typically realized by including a diversity term - often derived from information theory - in the objective function optimized by RL. However these approaches often require careful hyperparameter tuning to be effective. In this work, we demonstrate that less widely-used neuroevolution methods, specifically Quality Diversity (QD), are a competitive alternative to information-theory-augmented RL for skill discovery. Through an extensive empirical evaluation comparing eight state-of-the-art algorithms (four flagship algorithms from each line of work) on the basis of (i) metrics directly evaluating the skills' diversity, (ii) the skills' performance on adaptation tasks, and (iii) the skills' performance when used as primitives for hierarchical planning; QD methods are found to provide equal, and sometimes improved, performance whilst being less sensitive to hyperparameters and more scalable. As no single method is found to provide near-optimal performance across all environments, there is a rich scope for further research which we support by proposing future directions and providing optimized open-source implementations",

In this work, we investigate the implicit bias of gradient flow and gradient descent in two-layer fully-connected neural networks with leaky ReLU activations when the training data are nearly-orthogonal, a common property of high-dimensional data. For gradient flow, we leverage recent work on the implicit bias for homogeneous neural networks to show that asymptotically, gradient flow produces a neural network with rank at most two. Moreover, this network is an $\\ell_2$-max-margin solution (in parameter space), and has a linear decision boundary that corresponds to an approximate-max-margin linear predictor. For gradient descent, provided the random initialization variance is small enough, we show that a single step of gradient descent suffices to drastically reduce the rank of the network, and that the rank remains small throughout training. We provide experiments which suggest that a small initialization scale is important for finding low-rank neural networks with gradient descent",

    "abstract": "The Teacher-Student Framework (TSF) is a reinforcement learning setting where a teacher agent guards the training of a student agent by intervening and providing online demonstrations. Assuming optimal, the teacher policy has the perfect timing and capability to intervene in the learning process of the student agent, providing safety guarantee and exploration guidance. Nevertheless, in many real-world settings it is expensive or even impossible to obtain a well-performing teacher policy. In this work, we relax the assumption of a well-performing teacher and develop a new method that can incorporate arbitrary teacher policies with modest or inferior performance. We instantiate an Off-Policy Reinforcement Learning algorithm, termed Teacher-Student Shared Control (TS2C), which incorporates teacher intervention based on trajectory-based value estimation. Theoretical analysis validates that the proposed TS2C algorithm attains efficient exploration and substantial safety guarantee without being affected by the teacher's own performance. Experiments on various continuous control tasks show that our method can exploit teacher policies at different performance levels while maintaining a low training cost. Moreover, the student policy surpasses the imperfect teacher policy in terms of higher accumulated reward in held-out testing environments. Code is available at https://metadriverse.github.io/TS2C",

Specifically, we address the shortcut satisfaction issue by introducing dual variables for logical connectives, encoding how the constraint is satisfied. We further propose a variational framework where the encoded logical constraint is expressed as a distributional loss that is compatible with the model's original training loss. The theoretical analysis shows that the proposed approach bears some nice properties, and the experimental evaluations demonstrate its superior performance in both model generalizability and constraint satisfaction",

We first formulate the framework of Multi-Objective Online Convex Optimization, which encompasses a novel multi-objective regret. This regret is built upon a sequence-wise extension of the commonly used discrepancy metric Pareto suboptimality gap in zero-order multi-objective bandits. We then derive an equivalent form of the regret, making it amenable to be optimized via first-order iterative methods. To motivate the algorithm design, we give an explicit example in which equipping OMD with the vanilla min-norm solver for gradient composition will incur a linear regret, which shows that merely regularizing the iterates, as in single-objective online learning, is not enough to guarantee sublinear regrets in the multi-objective setting. To resolve this issue, we propose a novel min-regularized-norm solver that regularizes the composite weights. Combining min-regularized-norm with OMD results in the Doubly Regularized Online Mirror Multiple Descent algorithm. We further derive the multi-objective regret bound for the proposed algorithm, which matches the optimal bound in the single-objective setting.

This situation brings significant obstacles to existing imitation learning approaches, since most of them learn policies under homogeneous observation spaces. On the other hand, previous studies under different observation spaces have strong assumptions that these two observation spaces coexist during the entire learning process. However, in reality, the observation coexistence will be limited due to the high cost of acquiring expert observations. In this work, we study this challenging problem with limited observation coexistence under heterogeneous observations: Heterogeneously Observable Imitation Learning (HOIL). We identify two underlying issues in HOIL: the dynamics mismatch and the support mismatch, and further propose the Importance Weighting with REjection (IWRE) algorithm based on importance weighting and learning with rejection to solve HOIL problems. Experimental results show that IWRE can solve various HOIL tasks, including the challenging tasks of transforming the vision-based demonstrations to random access memory (RAM)-based policies in the Atari domain, even with limited visual observations",

To a local approximation, this quantity is precisely captured by what we term the Bellman score, i.e gradient of log probabilities of the optimal policy with respect to the reward. We introduce the Bellman score operator which provably converges to the gradient of the infinite-horizon optimal Q-values with respect to the reward which can then be used to directly estimate the score. Guided by our theory, we derive a practical score-learning algorithm which can be used for score estimation in high-dimensional state-actions spaces. We show that score-learning can be used to reliably identify rewards, perform counterfactual predictions, achieve state-of-the-art behavior imitation, and transfer policies across environments",

    "abstract": "There has been a proliferation of artificial intelligence applications, where model training is key to promising high-quality services for these applications. However, the model training process is both time-intensive and energy-intensive, inevitably affecting the user's demand for application efficiency. Layer freezing, an efficient model training technique, has been proposed to improve training efficiency. Although existing layer freezing methods demonstrate the great potential to reduce model training costs, they still remain shortcomings such as lacking generalizability and compromised accuracy. For instance, existing layer freezing methods either require the freeze configurations to be manually defined before training, which does not apply to different networks, or use heuristic freezing criteria that is hard to guarantee decent accuracy in different scenarios. Therefore, there lacks a generic and smart layer freezing method that can automatically perform ``in-situation'' layer freezing for different networks during training processes. To this end, we propose a generic and efficient training framework (SmartFRZ). The core proposed technique in SmartFRZ is attention-guided layer freezing, which can automatically select the appropriate layers to freeze without compromising accuracy. Experimental results show that SmartFRZ effectively reduces the amount of computation in training and achieves significant training acceleration, and outperforms the state-of-the-art layer freezing approaches",

    "abstract": "It is well known that the finite step-size ($h$) in Gradient descent (GD) implicitly regularizes solutions to flatter minimas. A natural question to ask is \\textit{Does the momentum parameter $\\beta$ (say) play a role in implicit regularization in Heavy-ball (H.B) momentum accelerated gradient descent (GD+M)?}. To answer this question, first, we show that the trajectory traced by discrete H.B momentum update (GD+M) is $O(h^2)$ close to a continuous trajectory induced by a modified loss, which consists of an original loss and an implicit regularizer. This implicit regularizer for (GD+M) is indeed stronger than that of (GD) by factor of $(\\frac{1+\\beta}{1-\\beta})$, thus explaining why (GD+M) shows better generalization performance and higher test accuracy than (GD). Furthermore, we extend our analysis to stochastic version of gradient descent with momentum (SGD+M) and propose a deterministic continuous trajectory that is $O(h^2)$ close to the discrete update of (SGD+M) in a strong approximation sense. We explore the implicit regularization in (SGD+M) and (GD+M) through a series of experiments validating our theory",

    "abstract": "Though end-to-end neural approaches have recently been dominating NLP tasks in both performance and ease-of-use, they lack interpretability and robustness. We propose Binder, a training-free neural-symbolic framework that maps the task input to a program, which (1) allows binding a unified API of language model (LM) functionalities to a programming language (e.g., SQL, Python) to extend its grammar coverage and thus tackle more diverse questions, (2) adopts an LM as both the program parser and the underlying model called by the API during execution, and (3) requires only a few in-context exemplar annotations. Specifically, we employ GPT-3 Codex as the LM. In the parsing stage, with only a few in-context exemplars, Codex is able to identify the part of the task input that cannot be answerable by the original programming language, correctly generate API calls to prompt Codex to solve the unanswerable part, and identify where to place the API calls while being compatible with the original grammar. In the execution stage, Codex can perform versatile functionalities (e.g., commonsense QA, information extraction) given proper prompts in the API calls. Binder achieves state-of-the-art results on WikiTableQuestions and TabFact datasets, with explicit output programs that benefit human debugging. Note that previous best systems are all finetuned on tens of thousands of task-specific samples, while Binder only uses dozens of annotations as in-context exemplars without any training.

However, offline RL requires the dataset to be reward-annotated, which presents practical challenges when reward engineering is difficult or when obtaining reward annotations is labor-intensive. In this paper, we introduce Optimal Transport Relabeling (OTR), an imitation learning algorithm that can automatically relabel offline data of mixed and unknown quality with rewards from a few good demonstrations. OTR's key idea is to use optimal transport to compute an optimal alignment between an unlabeled trajectory in the dataset and an expert demonstration to obtain a similarity measure that can be interpreted as a reward, which can then be used by an offline RL algorithm to learn the policy. OTR is easy to implement and computationally efficient. On D4RL benchmarks, we demonstrate that OTR with a single demonstration can consistently match the performance of offline RL with ground-truth rewards",

    "volume": "spotlight",
    "abstract": "We tackle the problem of aligning pre-trained large language models (LMs) with human preferences. If we view text generation as a sequential decision-making problem, reinforcement learning (RL) appears to be a natural conceptual framework. However, using RL for LM-based generation faces empirical challenges, including training instability due to the combinatorial action space, as well as a lack of open-source libraries and benchmarks customized for LM alignment. Thus, a question rises in the research community: is RL a practical paradigm for NLP? To help answer this, we first introduce an open-source modular library, $RL4LMs$ (Reinforcement Learning for Language Models), for optimizing language generators with RL. The library consists of on-policy RL algorithms that can be used to train any encoder or encoder-decoder LM in the HuggingFace library (Wolf et al. 2020) with an arbitrary reward function. Next, we present the $GRUE$ (General Reinforced-language Understanding Evaluation) benchmark, a set of 6 language generation tasks which are supervised not by target strings, but by reward functions which capture automated measures of human preference.GRUE is the first leaderboard-style evaluation of RL algorithms for NLP tasks. Finally, we introduce an easy-to-use, performant RL algorithm, $NLPO$ (Natural Language Policy Optimization)} that learns to effectively reduce the combinatorial action space in language generation. We show 1) that RL techniques are generally better than supervised methods at aligning LMs to human preferences; and 2) that NLPO exhibits greater stability and performance than previous policy gradient methods (e.g., PPO (Schulman et al. 2017)), based on both automatic and human evaluations",

Here we mathematically prove that simple biological constraints on neurons, namely nonnegativity and energy efficiency in both activity and weights, promote such sought after disentangled representations by enforcing neurons to become selective for single factors of task variation. We demonstrate these constraints lead to disentanglement in a variety of tasks and architectures, including variational autoencoders. We also use this theory to explain why the brain partitions its cells into distinct cell types such as grid and object-vector cells, and also explain when the brain instead entangles representations in response to entangled task factors. Overall, this work provides a mathematical understanding of why single neurons in the brain often represent single human-interpretable factors, and steps towards an understanding task structure shapes the structure of brain representation",

    "volume": "spotlight",
    "abstract": "Simulating rigid collisions among arbitrary shapes is notoriously difficult due to complex geometry and the strong non-linearity of the interactions. While graph neural network (GNN)-based models are effective at learning to simulate complex physical dynamics, such as fluids, cloth and articulated bodies, they have been less effective and efficient on rigid-body physics, except with very simple shapes. Existing methods that model collisions through the meshes' nodes are often inaccurate because they struggle when collisions occur on faces far from nodes. Alternative approaches that represent the geometry densely with many particles are prohibitively expensive for complex shapes. Here we introduce the ``Face Interaction Graph Network'' (FIGNet) which extends beyond GNN-based methods, and computes interactions between mesh faces, rather than nodes. Compared to learned node- and particle-based methods, FIGNet is around 4x more accurate in simulating complex shape interactions, while also 8x more computationally efficient on sparse, rigid meshes. Moreover, FIGNet can learn frictional dynamics directly from real-world data, and can be more accurate than analytical solvers given modest amounts of training data. FIGNet represents a key step forward in one of the few remaining physical domains which have seen little competition from learned simulators, and offers allied fields such as robotics, graphics and mechanical design a new tool for simulation and model-based planning",

We then inquire under which conditions the global minima of the loss recover the `true' rank of the data: we show that for too large depths the global minimum will be approximately rank 1 (underestimating the rank); we then argue that there is a range of depths which grows with the number of datapoints where the true rank is recovered. Finally, we discuss the effect of the rank of a classifier on the topology of the resulting class boundaries and show that autoencoders with optimal nonlinear rank are naturally denoising",

    "abstract": "Discovering causal relationships between different variables from time series data has been a long-standing challenge for many domains. For example, in stock markets, the announcement of acquisitions from leading companies may have immediate effects on stock prices and increase the uncertainty of the future market due to this past action. To discover causal relations in such case, the model needs to consider non-linear relations between variables, instantaneous effect and the change of noise distribution due to past actions. We name the latter as history-dependent noise. However, previous works do not offer a solution addressing all these problems together. In this paper, we propose a structural equation model, called Rhino, which combines vector auto-regression, deep learning and variational inference to model non-linear relationships with instantaneous effects while allowing the noise distribution to be modulated by history observations. Theoretically, we prove the structural identifiability of Rhino. Our empirical results from extensive synthetic experiments and two real-world benchmarks demonstrate better discovery performance compared to relevant baselines, with ablation studies revealing its robustness under model misspecification",

DINO is one such method based on a cross-entropy loss between $K$-dimensional probability vectors, obtained by applying a softmax function to the dot product between representations and learnt prototypes. Given the fact that the learned representations are $L^2$-normalized, we show that DINO and its derivatives, such as iBOT, can be interpreted as a mixture model of von Mises-Fisher components. With this interpretation, DINO assumes equal precision for all components when the prototypes are also $L^2$-normalized. Using this insight we propose DINO-vMF, that adds appropriate normalization constants when computing the cluster assignment probabilities. Unlike DINO, DINO-vMF is stable also for the larger ViT-Base model with unnormalized prototypes. We show that the added flexibility of the mixture model is beneficial in terms of better image representations. The DINO-vMF pre-trained model consistently performs better than DINO on a range of downstream tasks. We obtain similar improvements for iBOT-vMF vs iBOT and thereby show the relevance of our proposed modification also for other methods derived from DINO",

    "volume": "spotlight",
    "abstract": "Self-supervised pretraining has been extensively studied in language and vision domains, where a unified model can be easily adapted to various downstream tasks by pretraining representations without explicit labels. When it comes to sequential decision-making tasks, however, it is difficult to properly design such a pretraining approach that can cope with both high-dimensional perceptual information and the complexity of sequential control over long interaction horizons. The challenge becomes combinatorially more complex if we want to pretrain representations amenable to a large variety of tasks. To tackle this problem, in this work, we formulate a general pretraining-finetuning pipeline for sequential decision making, under which we propose a generic pretraining framework \\textit{Self-supervised Multi-task pretrAining with contRol Transformer (SMART)}. By systematically investigating pretraining regimes, we carefully design a Control Transformer (CT) coupled with a novel control-centric pretraining objective in a self-supervised manner. SMART encourages the representation to capture the common essential information relevant to short-term control and long-term control, which is transferrable across tasks. We show by extensive experiments in DeepMind Control Suite that SMART significantly improves the learning efficiency among seen and unseen downstream tasks and domains under different learning scenarios including Imitation Learning (IL) and Reinforcement Learning (RL). Benefiting from the proposed control-centric objective, SMART is resilient to distribution shift between pretraining and finetuning, and even works well with low-quality pretraining datasets that are randomly collected.

Hence, training DNNs to be certifiably robust to these perturbations is critical.

To address these challenges, we propose the first provable defense for deterministic certified geometric robustness. Our framework leverages a novel GPU-optimized verifier that can certify images between 60$\\times$ to 42,600$\\times$ faster than existing geometric robustness verifiers, and thus unlike existing works, is fast enough for use in training. Across multiple datasets, our results show that networks trained via our framework consistently achieve state-of-the-art deterministic certified geometric robustness and clean accuracy. Furthermore, for the first time, we verify the geometric robustness of a neural network for the challenging, real-world setting of autonomous driving",

Our proposed method, dubbed Prototype-Wrapper Network (PW-Net), wraps around any neural agent backbone, and results indicate that it does not worsen performance relative to black-box models.

    "abstract": "Extensive work has demonstrated that equivariant neural networks can significantly improve sample efficiency and generalization by enforcing an inductive bias in the network architecture. These applications typically assume that the domain symmetry is fully described by explicit transformations of the model inputs and outputs. However, many real-life applications contain only latent or partial symmetries which cannot be easily described by simple transformations of the input. In these cases, it is necessary to learn symmetry in the environment instead of imposing it mathematically on the network architecture. We discover, surprisingly, that imposing equivariance constraints that do not exactly match the domain symmetry is very helpful in learning the true symmetry in the environment. We differentiate between extrinsic and incorrect symmetry constraints and show that while imposing incorrect symmetry can impede the model's performance, imposing extrinsic symmetry can actually improve performance. We demonstrate that an equivariant model can significantly outperform non-equivariant methods on domains with latent symmetries both in supervised learning and in reinforcement learning for robotic manipulation and control problems",

However, when the various downstream tasks have data distributions different from the pre-training data, the semantically irrelevant pre-training information might result in negative transfer, impeding MAE's scalability. To address this issue, we propose a novel MAE-based pre-training paradigm, Mixture of Cluster-conditional Experts (MoCE), which can be trained once but provides customized pre-training models for diverse downstream tasks. Different from the mixture of experts (MoE), our MoCE trains each expert only with semantically relevant images by using cluster-conditional gates. Thus, each downstream task can be allocated to its customized model pre-trained with data most similar to the downstream data. Experiments on a collection of 11 downstream tasks show that MoCE outperforms the vanilla MAE by 2.45\\% on average.

    "volume": "spotlight",
    "abstract": "Recent empirical studies on domain generalization (DG) have shown that DG algorithms that perform well on some distribution shifts fail on others, and no state-of-the-art DG algorithm performs consistently well on all shifts. Moreover, real-world data often has multiple distribution shifts over different attributes; hence we introduce multi-attribute distribution shift datasets and find that the accuracy of existing DG algorithms falls even further. To explain these results, we provide a formal characterization of generalization under multi-attribute shifts using a canonical causal graph. Based on the relationship between spurious attributes and the classification label, we obtain realizations of the canonical causal graph that characterize common distribution shifts and show that each shift entails different independence constraints over observed variables. As a result, we prove that any algorithm based on a single, fixed constraint cannot work well across all shifts, providing theoretical evidence for mixed empirical results on DG algorithms. Based on this insight, we develop Causally Adaptive Constraint Minimization (CACM), an algorithm that uses knowledge about the data-generating process to adaptively identify and apply the correct independence constraints for regularization. Results on fully synthetic, MNIST, small NORB, and Waterbirds datasets, covering binary and multi-valued attributes and labels, show that adaptive dataset-dependent constraints lead to the highest accuracy on unseen domains whereas incorrect constraints fail to do so.

First, the player does not need to know the policy of the opponent to update its policy. Second, when both players adopt the algorithm, their joint policy converges to a Nash equilibrium of the game. To this end, we construct a meta-algorithm, dubbed as $\\texttt{Homotopy-PO}$, which provably finds a Nash equilibrium at a global linear rate.

    "abstract": "Recent approximations to backpropagation (BP) have mitigated many of BP's computational inefficiencies and incompatibilities with biology, but important limitations still remain. Moreover, the approximations significantly decrease accuracy in benchmarks, suggesting that an entirely different approach may be more fruitful. Here, grounded on recent theory for Hebbian learning in soft winner-take-all networks, we present multilayer SoftHebb, i.e. an algorithm that trains deep neural networks, without any feedback, target, or error signals. As a result, it achieves efficiency by avoiding weight transport, non-local plasticity, time-locking of layer updates, iterative equilibria, and (self-) supervisory or other feedback signals – which were necessary in other approaches. Its increased efficiency and biological compatibility do not trade off accuracy compared to state-of-the-art bio-plausible learning, but rather improve it. With up to five hidden layers and an added linear classifier, accuracies on MNIST, CIFAR-10, STL-10, and ImageNet, respectively reach 99.4%, 80.3%, 76.2%, and 27.3%. In conclusion, SoftHebb shows with a radically different approach from BP that Deep Learning over few layers may be plausible in the brain and increases the accuracy of bio-plausible machine learning.

Nonetheless, existing statistical tools for extracting neural manifolds face limitations in terms of interpretability of latents with respect to task variables, and can be hard to apply to datasets with no trial repeats. Here we propose a novel probabilistic framework that allows for interpretable partitioning of population variability within and across areas in the context of naturalistic behavior. Our approach for task aligned manifold estimation (TAME-GP) explicitly partitions variability into private and shared sources which can themselves be subdivided in task-relevant and task irrelevant components, uses a realistic Poisson noise model, and introduces temporal smoothing of latent trajectories in the form of a Gaussian Process prior. This TAME-GP graphical model allows for robust estimation of task-relevant variability in local population responses, and of shared co-variability between brain areas. We demonstrate the efficiency of our estimator on within model and biologically motivated simulated data. We also apply it to several datasets of neural population recordings during behavior. Overall, our results demonstrate the capacity of TAME-GP to capture meaningful intra- and inter-area neural variability with single trial resolution",

Our work is orthogonal to these methods: we instead focus on providing a unified and efficient framework for Metadata Archaeology -- uncovering and inferring metadata of examples in a dataset. We curate different subsets of data that might exist in a dataset (e.g. mislabeled, atypical, or out-of-distribution examples) using simple transformations, and leverage differences in learning dynamics between these probe suites to infer metadata of interest.

    "abstract": "The use of pretrained deep neural networks represents an attractive way to achieve strong results with few data available. When specialized in dense problems such as object detection, learning local rather than global information in images has proven to be more efficient. However, for unsupervised pretraining, the popular contrastive learning requires a large batch size and, therefore, a lot of resources. To address this problem, we are interested in transformer-based object detectors that have recently gained traction in the community with good performance and with the particularity of generating many diverse object proposals. In this work, we present Proposal Selection Contrast (ProSeCo), a novel unsupervised overall pretraining approach that leverages this property. ProSeCo uses the large number of object proposals generated by the detector for contrastive learning, which allows the use of a smaller batch size, combined with object-level features to learn local information in the images. To improve the effectiveness of the contrastive loss, we introduce the object location information in the selection of positive examples to take into account multiple overlapping object proposals. When reusing pretrained backbone, we advocate for consistency in learning local information between the backbone and the detection head. We show that our method outperforms state of the art in unsupervised pretraining for object detection on standard and novel benchmarks in learning with fewer data",

However, without appropriate knowledge and exploration, skills may provide control only over a restricted area of the environment, limiting their applicability.

We present Choreographer, a model-based agent that exploits its world model to learn and adapt skills in imagination. Our method decouples the exploration and skill learning processes, being able to discover skills in the latent state space of the model. During adaptation, the agent uses a meta-controller to evaluate and adapt the learned skills efficiently by deploying them in parallel in imagination. Choreographer is able to learn skills both from offline data, and by collecting data simultaneously with an exploration policy. The skills can be used to effectively adapt to downstream tasks, as we show in the URL benchmark, where we outperform previous approaches from both pixels and states inputs.

We ask if machines – specifically, artificial intelligence (AI) navigation agents – also build implicit (or ‘mental') maps. A positive answer to this question would (a) explain the surprising phenomenon in recent literature of ostensibly map-free neural-networks achieving strong performance, and (b) strengthen the evidence of mapping as a fundamental mechanism for navigation by intelligent embodied agents, whether they be biological or artificial. Unlike animal navigation, we can judiciously design the agent's perceptual system and control the learning paradigm to nullify alternative navigation mechanisms. Specifically, we train ‘blind' agents – with sensing limited to only egomotion and no other sensing of any kind – to perform PointGoal navigation (‘go to $\\Delta$x, $\\Delta$y') via reinforcement learning. Our agents are composed of navigation-agnostic components (fully-connected and recurrent neural networks), and our experimental setup provides no inductive bias towards mapping. Despite these harsh conditions, we find that blind agents are (1) surprisingly effective navigators in new environments (∼95% success); (2) they utilize memory over long horizons (remembering ∼1,000 steps of past experience in an episode); (3) this memory enables them to exhibit intelligent behavior (following walls, detecting collisions, taking shortcuts); (4) there is emergence of maps and collision detection neurons in the representations of the environment built by a blind agent as it navigates; and (5) the emergent maps are selective and task dependent (e.g. the agent ‘forgets' exploratory detours). Overall, this paper presents no new techniques for the AI audience, but a surprising finding, an insight, and an explanation",

    "abstract": "We propose a novel algorithm for offline reinforcement learning called Value Iteration with Perturbed Rewards (VIPeR), which amalgamates the pessimism principle with random perturbations of the value function. Most current offline RL algorithms explicitly construct statistical confidence regions to obtain pessimism via lower confidence bounds (LCB), which cannot easily scale to complex problems where a neural network is used to estimate the value functions. Instead, VIPeR implicitly obtains pessimism by simply perturbing the offline data multiple times with carefully-designed i.i.d. Gaussian noises to learn an ensemble of estimated state-action {value functions} and acting greedily with respect to the minimum of the ensemble. The estimated state-action values are obtained by fitting a parametric model (e.g., neural networks) to the perturbed datasets using gradient descent. As a result, VIPeR only needs $\\mathcal{O}(1)$ time complexity for action selection, while LCB-based algorithms require at least $\\Omega(K^2)$, where $K$ is the total number of trajectories in the offline data. We also propose a novel data-splitting technique that helps remove a factor involving the log of the covering number in our bound. We prove that VIPeR yields a provable uncertainty quantifier with overparameterized neural networks and enjoys a bound on sub-optimality of $\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}( { \\kappa H^{5/2} \\tilde{d} }/{\\sqrt{K}})$, where $\\tilde{d}$ is the effective dimension, $H$ is the horizon length and $\\kappa$ measures the distributional shift. We corroborate the statistical and computational efficiency of VIPeR with an empirical evaluation on a wide set of synthetic and real-world datasets. To the best of our knowledge, VIPeR is the first algorithm for offline RL that is provably efficient for general Markov decision processes (MDPs) with neural network function approximation",

Our work follows the major paradigm where the model learns to be invariant to some predefined image transformations (cropping, blurring, color jittering, etc.), while avoiding a degenerate solution by regularizing the embedding distribution. Our particular contribution is to propose a loss family promoting the embedding distribution to be close to the uniform distribution on the hypersphere, with respect to the maximum mean discrepancy pseudometric. We demonstrate that this family encompasses several regularizers of former methods, including uniformity-based and information-maximization methods, which are variants of our flexible regularization loss with different kernels.

    "volume": "spotlight",
    "abstract": "Intelligent biological systems are characterized by their embodiment in a complex environment and the intimate interplay between their nervous systems and the nonlinear mechanical properties of their bodies. This coordination, in which the dynamics of the motor system co-evolved to reduce the computational burden on the brain, is referred to as \"mechanical intelligence\" or \"morphological computation\". In this work, we seek to develop machine learning analogs of this process, in which we jointly learn the morphology of complex nonlinear elastic solids along with a deep neural network to control it. By using a specialized differentiable simulator of elastic mechanics coupled to conventional deep learning architectures---which we refer to as neuromechanical autoencoders---we are able to learn to perform morphological computation via gradient descent. Key to our approach is the use of mechanical metamaterials---cellular solids, in particular---as the morphological substrate. Just as deep neural networks provide flexible and massively-parametric function approximators for perceptual and control tasks, cellular solid metamaterials are promising as a rich and learnable space for approximating a variety of actuation tasks. In this work we take advantage of these complementary computational concepts to co-design materials and neural network controls to achieve nonintuitive mechanical behavior. We demonstrate in simulation how it is possible to achieve translation, rotation, and shape matching, as well as a \"digital MNIST\" task. We additionally manufacture and evaluate one of the designs to verify its real-world behavior",

    "title": "VIP: Towards Universal Visual Reward and Representation via Value-Implicit Pre-Training",
    "volume": "spotlight",
    "abstract": "Reward and representation learning are two long-standing challenges for learning an expanding set of robot manipulation skills from sensory observations. Given the inherent cost and scarcity of in-domain, task-specific robot data, learning from large, diverse, offline human videos has emerged as a promising path towards acquiring a generally useful visual representation for control; however, how these human videos can be used for general-purpose reward learning remains an open question. We introduce $\\textbf{V}$alue-$\\textbf{I}$mplicit $\\textbf{P}$re-training (VIP), a self-supervised pre-trained visual representation capable of generating dense and smooth reward functions for unseen robotic tasks. VIP casts representation learning from human videos as an offline goal-conditioned reinforcement learning problem and derives a self-supervised dual goal-conditioned value-function objective that does not depend on actions, enabling pre-training on unlabeled human videos. Theoretically, VIP can be understood as a novel implicit time contrastive objective that generates a temporally smooth embedding, enabling the value function to be implicitly defined via the embedding distance, which can then be used to construct the reward for any goal-image specified downstream task. Trained on large-scale Ego4D human videos and without any fine-tuning on in-domain, task-specific data, VIP can provide dense visual reward for an extensive set of simulated and $\\textbf{real-robot}$ tasks, enabling diverse reward-based visual control methods and significantly outperforming all prior pre-trained representations. Notably, VIP can enable simple, few-shot offline RL on a suite of real-world robot tasks with as few as 20 trajectories",

    "title": "Subquadratic Algorithms for Kernel Matrices via Kernel Density Estimation",
    "volume": "spotlight",
    "abstract": "Kernel matrices, as well as weighted graphs represented by them, are ubiquitous objects in machine learning, statistics and other related fields. The main drawback of using kernel methods (learning and inference using kernel matrices) is efficiency -- given $n$ input points, most kernel-based algorithms need to materialize the full $n \\times n$ kernel matrix before performing any subsequent computation, thus incurring $\\Omega(n^2)$ runtime. Breaking this quadratic barrier for various problems has therefore, been a subject of extensive research efforts. We break the quadratic barrier and obtain \\emph{subquadratic} time algorithms for several fundamental linear-algebraic and graph processing primitives, including approximating the top eigenvalue and eigenvector, spectral sparsification, solving linear systems, local clustering, low-rank approximation, arboricity estimation and counting weighted triangles. We build on the recently developed Kernel Density Estimation framework, which (after preprocessing in time subquadratic in $n$) can return estimates of row/column sums of the kernel matrix. In particular, we develop efficient reductions from \\emph{weighted vertex} and \\emph{weighted edge sampling} on kernel graphs, \\emph{simulating random walks} on kernel graphs, and \\emph{importance sampling} on matrices to Kernel Density Estimation and show that we can generate samples from these distributions in \\emph{sublinear} (in the support of the distribution) time. Our reductions are the central ingredient in each of our applications and we believe they may be of independent interest. We empirically demonstrate the efficacy of our algorithms on low-rank approximation (LRA) and spectral sparsification, where we observe a $\\textbf{9x}$ decrease in the number of kernel evaluations over baselines for LRA and a $\\textbf{41x}$ reduction in the graph size for spectral sparsification",

    "abstract": "While adversarial training is generally used as a defense mechanism, recent works show that it can also act as a regularizer. By co-training a neural network on clean and adversarial inputs, it is possible to improve classification accuracy on the clean, non-adversarial inputs. We demonstrate that, contrary to previous findings, it is not necessary to separate batch statistics when co-training on clean and adversarial inputs, and that it is sufficient to use adapters with few domain-specific parameters for each type of input. We establish that using the classification token of a Vision Transformer (ViT) as an adapter is enough to match the classification performance of dual normalization layers, while using significantly less additional parameters. First, we improve upon the top-1 accuracy of a non-adversarially trained ViT-B16 model by +1.12% on ImageNet (reaching 83.76% top-1 accuracy). Second, and more importantly, we show that training with adapters enables model soups through linear combinations of the clean and adversarial tokens. These model soups, which we call adversarial model soups, allow us to trade-off between clean and robust accuracy without sacrificing efficiency. Finally, we show that we can easily adapt the resulting models in the face of distribution shifts. Our ViT-B16 obtains top-1 accuracies on ImageNet variants that are on average +4.00% better than those obtained with Masked Autoencoders",

    "abstract": "Neural Algorithmic Reasoning is an emerging area of machine learning which seeks to infuse algorithmic computation in neural networks, typically by training neural models to approximate steps of classical algorithms. In this context, much of the current work has focused on learning reachability and shortest path graph algorithms, showing that joint learning on similar algorithms is beneficial for generalisation. However, when targeting more complex problems, such \"similar\" algorithms become more difficult to find. Here, we propose to learn algorithms by exploiting duality of the underlying algorithmic problem. Many algorithms solve optimisation problems. We demonstrate that simultaneously learning the dual definition of these optimisation problems in algorithmic learning allows for better learning and qualitatively better solutions. Specifically, we exploit the max-flow min-cut theorem to simultaneously learn these two algorithms over synthetically generated graphs, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed approach. We then validate the real-world utility of our dual algorithmic reasoner by deploying it on a challenging brain vessel classification task, which likely depends on the vessels' flow properties. We demonstrate a clear performance gain when using our model within such a context, and empirically show that learning the max-flow and min-cut algorithms together is critical for achieving such a result",

Using our framework, we derive popular attention layers used in practice and propose two new attentions: 1) the Batch Normalized Attention (Attention-BN) derived from the batch normalization layer and 2) the Attention with Scaled Head (Attention-SH) derived from using less training data to fit the SVR model. We empirically demonstrate the advantages of the Attention-BN and Attention-SH in reducing head redundancy, increasing the model's accuracy, and improving the model's efficiency in a variety of practical applications including image and time-series classification",

    "abstract": "Incorporating second-order gradient information (curvature) into optimization can dramatically reduce the number of iterations required to train machine learning models. In natural gradient descent, such information comes from the Fisher information matrix which yields a number of desirable properties. As exact natural gradient updates are intractable for large models, successful methods such as KFAC and sequels approximate the Fisher in a structured form that can easily be inverted. However, this requires model/layer-specific tensor algebra and certain approximations that are often difficult to justify. Here, we use ideas from Legendre-Fenchel duality to learn a direct and efficiently evaluated model for the product of the inverse Fisher with any vector, in an online manner, leading to natural gradient steps that get progressively more accurate over time despite noisy gradients. We prove that the resulting \"Fisher-Legendre\" (FishLeg) optimizer converges to a (global) minimum of non-convex functions satisfying the PL condition, which applies in particular to deep linear networks. On standard auto-encoder benchmarks, we show empirically that FishLeg outperforms standard first-order optimization methods, and performs on par with or better than other second-order methods, especially when using small batches. Thanks to its generality, we expect our approach to facilitate the handling of a variety neural network layers in future work",

    "abstract": "Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are well suited for solving sequence tasks in resource-constrained systems due to their expressivity and low computational requirements. However, there is still a need to bridge the gap between what RNNs are capable of in terms of efficiency and performance and real-world application requirements. The memory and computational requirements arising from propagating the activations of all the neurons at every time step to every connected neuron, together with the sequential dependence of activations, contribute to the inefficiency of training and using RNNs. We propose a solution inspired by biological neuron dynamics that makes the communication between RNN units sparse and discrete. This makes the backward pass with backpropagation through time (BPTT) computationally sparse and efficient as well. We base our model on the gated recurrent unit (GRU), extending it with units that emit discrete events for communication triggered by a threshold so that no information is communicated to other units in the absence of events. We show theoretically that the communication between units, and hence the computation required for both the forward and backward passes, scales with the number of events in the network. Our model achieves efficiency without compromising task performance, demonstrating competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art recurrent network models in real-world tasks, including language modeling. The dynamic activity sparsity mechanism also makes our model well suited for novel energy-efficient neuromorphic hardware. Code is available at https://github.com/KhaleelKhan/EvNN/",

The idea of rectified flow is to learn the ODE to follow the straight paths connecting the points drawn from $\\pi_0$ and $\\pi_1$ as much as possible. This is achieved by solving a straightforward nonlinear least squares optimization problem, which can be easily scaled to large models without introducing extra parameters beyond standard supervised learning. The straight paths are the shortest paths between two points, and can be simulated exactly without time discretization and hence yield computationally efficient models. We show that, by learning a rectified flow from data, we effectively turn an arbitrary coupling of $\\pi_0$ and $\\pi_1$ to a new deterministic coupling with provably non-increasing convex transport costs. In addition, with a ``reflow\" procedure that iteratively learns a new rectified flow from the data bootstrapped from the previous one, we obtain a sequence of flows with increasingly straight paths, which can be simulated accurately with coarse time discretization in the inference phase. In empirical studies, we show that rectified flow performs superbly on image generation, image-to-image translation, and domain adaptation. In particular, on image generation and translation, our method yields nearly straight flows that give high quality results even with \\emph{a single Euler discretization step}.

Most existing PLL approaches assume that the incorrect labels in each training example are randomly picked as the candidate labels and model the generation process of the candidate labels in a simple way. However, these approaches usually do not perform as well as expected due to the fact that the generation process of the candidate labels is always instance-dependent. Therefore, it deserves to be modeled in a refined way. In this paper, we consider instance-dependent PLL and assume that the generation process of the candidate labels could decompose into two sequential parts, where the correct label emerges first in the mind of the annotator but then the incorrect labels related to the feature are also selected with the correct label as candidate labels due to uncertainty of labeling. Motivated by this consideration, we propose a novel PLL method that performs Maximum A Posterior(MAP) based on an explicitly modeled generation process of candidate labels via decomposed probability distribution models.

Inspired by the efficacy of the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) method in the single-objective context, we generalize ADMM to derive a first-order method for cVIs, that we refer to as ADMM-based interior-point method for constrained VIs (ACVI). We provide convergence guarantees for ACVI in two general classes of problems: (i) when the operator is $\\xi$-monotone, and (ii) when it is monotone, some constraints are active and the game is not purely rotational. When the operator is in addition L-Lipschitz for the latter case, we match known lower bounds on rates for the gap function of $\\mathcal{O}(1/\\sqrt{K})$ and $\\mathcal{O}(1/K)$ for the last and average iterate, respectively. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first presentation of a first-order interior-point method for the general cVI problem that has a global convergence guarantee. Moreover, unlike previous work in this setting, ACVI provides a means to solve cVIs when the constraints are nontrivial. Empirical analyses demonstrate clear advantages of ACVI over common first-order methods. In particular, (i) cyclical behavior is notably reduced as our methods approach the solution from the analytic center, and (ii) unlike projection-based methods that zigzag when near a constraint, ACVI efficiently handles the constraints",

Empirical evidence showed that QNNs with handcraft symmetric ans\\\"atze generally experience better trainability than those with asymmetric ans\\\"atze, while theoretical explanations remain vague. To fill this knowledge gap, here we propose the effective quantum neural tangent kernel (EQNTK) and connect this concept with over-parameterization theory to quantify the convergence of QNNs towards the global optima. We uncover that the advance of symmetric ans\\\"atze attributes to their large EQNTK value with low effective dimension, which requests few parameters and quantum circuit depth to reach the over-parameterization regime permitting a benign loss landscape and fast convergence. Guided by EQNTK, we further devise a symmetric pruning (SP) scheme to automatically tailor a symmetric ansatz from an over-parameterized and asymmetric one to greatly improve the performance of QNNs when the explicit symmetry information of Hamiltonian is unavailable. Extensive numerical simulations are conducted to validate the analytical results of EQNTK and the effectiveness of SP",

    "title": "Knowledge-in-Context: Towards Knowledgeable Semi-Parametric Language Models",
    "volume": "spotlight",
    "abstract": "Fully-parametric language models generally require a huge number of model parameters to store the necessary knowledge for solving multiple natural language tasks in zero/few-shot settings. In addition, it is hard to adapt to the evolving world knowledge without the costly model re-training. In this paper, we develop a novel semi-parametric language model architecture, Knowledge-in-Context (KiC), which empowers a parametric text-to-text language model with a knowledge-rich external memory. Specifically, the external memory contains six different types of knowledge: entity, dictionary, commonsense, event, script, and causality knowledge. For each input instance, the KiC model adaptively selects a knowledge type and retrieves the most helpful pieces of knowledge. The input instance along with its knowledge augmentation is fed into a text-to-text model (e.g., T5) to generate the output answer, where both the input and the output are in natural language forms after prompting. Interestingly, we find that KiC can be identified as a special mixture-of-experts (MoE) model, where the knowledge selector plays the role of a router that is used to determine the sequence-to-expert assignment in MoE. This key observation inspires us to develop a novel algorithm for training KiC with an instance-adaptive knowledge selector. As a knowledge-rich semi-parametric language model, KiC only needs a much smaller parametric part to achieve superior zero-shot performance on unseen tasks. By evaluating on 40+ different tasks, we show that KiC-Large with 770M parameters easily outperforms large language models that are 4-39x larger. In addition, KiC also exhibits emergent abilities at a much smaller model scale compared to the fully-parametric models",

    "volume": "spotlight",
    "abstract": "Humans manipulate various kinds of fluids in their everyday life: creating latte art, scooping floating objects from water, rolling an ice cream cone, etc. Using robots to augment or replace human labors in these daily settings remain as a challenging task due to the multifaceted complexities of fluids. Previous research in robotic fluid manipulation mostly consider fluids governed by an ideal, Newtonian model in simple task settings (e.g., pouring water into a container). However, the vast majority of real-world fluid systems manifest their complexities in terms of the fluid's complex material behaviors (e.g., elastoplastic deformation) and multi-component interactions (e.g. coffee and frothed milk when making latte art), both of which were well beyond the scope of the current literature. To evaluate robot learning algorithms on understanding and interacting with such complex fluid systems, a comprehensive virtual platform with versatile simulation capabilities and well-established tasks is needed. In this work, we introduce FluidLab, a simulation environment with a diverse set of manipulation tasks involving complex fluid dynamics. These tasks address interactions between solid and fluid as well as among multiple fluids. At the heart of our platform is a fully differentiable physics simulator, FluidEngine, providing GPU-accelerated simulations and gradient calculations for various material types and their couplings, extending the scope of the existing differentiable simulation engines. We identify several challenges for fluid manipulation learning by evaluating a set of reinforcement learning and trajectory optimization methods on our platform. To address these challenges, we propose several domain-specific optimization schemes coupled with differentiable physics, which are empirically shown to be effective in tackling optimization problems featured by fluid system's non-convex and non-smooth properties. Furthermore, we demonstrate reasonable sim-to-real transfer by deploying optimized trajectories in real-world settings. FluidLab is publicly available at: https://fluidlab2023.github.io",

    "abstract": "We introduce a new paradigm for generative modeling built on Continuous Normalizing Flows (CNFs), allowing us to train CNFs at unprecedented scale. Specifically, we present the notion of Flow Matching (FM), a simulation-free approach for training CNFs based on regressing vector fields of fixed conditional probability paths. Flow Matching is compatible with a general family of Gaussian probability paths for transforming between noise and data samples---which subsumes existing diffusion paths as specific instances. Interestingly, we find that employing FM with diffusion paths results in a more robust and stable alternative for training diffusion models. Furthermore, Flow Matching opens the door to training CNFs with other, non-diffusion probability paths. An instance of particular interest is using Optimal Transport (OT) displacement interpolation to define the conditional probability paths. These paths are more efficient than diffusion paths, provide faster training and sampling, and result in better generalization. Training CNFs using Flow Matching on ImageNet leads to consistently better performance than alternative diffusion-based methods in terms of both likelihood and sample quality, and allows fast and reliable sample generation using off-the-shelf numerical ODE solvers",

Unfortunately, existing methods fail to produce teams of agents that are simultaneously diverse, high performing, and reasonable. In this work, we propose a novel approach, adversarial diversity (ADVERSITY), which is designed for turn-based Dec-POMDPs with public actions. ADVERSITY relies on off-belief learning to encourage reasonableness and skill, and on ''repulsive'' fictitious transitions to encourage diversity.

    "title": "Optimal Conservative Offline RL with General Function Approximation via Augmented Lagrangian",
    "volume": "spotlight",
    "abstract": "Offline reinforcement learning (RL), which aims at learning good policies from historical data, has received significant attention over the past years. Much effort has focused on improving offline RL practicality by addressing the prevalent issue of partial data coverage through various forms of conservative policy learning. While the majority of algorithms do not have finite- sample guarantees, several provable conservative offline RL algorithms are designed and analyzed within the single-policy concentrability framework that handles partial coverage. Yet, in the nonlinear function approximation setting where confidence intervals are difficult to obtain, existing provable algorithms suffer from computational intractability, prohibitively strong assumptions, and suboptimal statistical rates. In this paper, we leverage the marginalized importance sampling (MIS) formulation of RL and present the first set of offline RL algorithms that are statistically optimal and practical under general function approximation and single-policy concentrability, bypassing the need for uncertainty quantification. We identify that the key to successfully solving the sample-based approximation of the MIS problem is ensuring that certain occupancy validity constraints are nearly satisfied. We enforce these constraints by a novel application of the augmented Lagrangian method and prove the following result: with the MIS formulation, augmented Lagrangian is enough for statistically optimal offline RL. In stark contrast to prior algorithms that induce additional conservatism through methods such as behavior regularization, our approach provably eliminates this need and reinterprets regularizers as \"enforcers of occupancy validity\" than \"promoters of conservatism",

    "abstract": "Publicly available source-code libraries are continuously growing and changing. This makes it impossible for models of code to keep current with all available APIs by simply training these models on existing code repositories. Thus, existing models inherently cannot generalize to using unseen functions and libraries, because these would never appear in the training data. In contrast, when human programmers use functions and libraries for the first time, they frequently refer to textual resources such as code manuals and documentation, to explore and understand the available functionality. Inspired by this observation, we introduce DocPrompting: a natural-language-to-code generation approach that explicitly leverages documentation by (1) retrieving the relevant documentation pieces given an NL intent, and (2) generating code based on the NL intent and the retrieved documentation. DocPrompting is general: it can be applied to any programming language and is agnostic to the underlying neural model. We demonstrate that DocPrompting consistently improves NL-to-code models: DocPrompting improves strong base models such as CodeT5 by 2.85% in pass@1 (52% relative gain) and 4.39% in pass@10 (30% relative gain) in execution-based evaluation on the popular Python CoNaLa benchmark; on a new Bash dataset tldr, DocPrompting improves CodeT5 and GPT-Neo1.3B by up to absolute 6.9% exact match",

In this work, we explore a method for learning a single policy that manipulates various forms of agents to solve various tasks by distilling a large amount of proficient behavioral data. In order to align input-output (IO) interface among multiple tasks and diverse agent morphologies while preserving essential 3D geometric relations, we introduce morphology-task graph, which treats observations, actions and goals/task in a unified graph representation. We also develop MxT-Bench for fast large-scale behavior generation, which supports procedural generation of diverse morphology-task combinations with a minimal blueprint and hardware-accelerated simulator. Through efficient representation and architecture selection on MxT-Bench, we find out that a morphology-task graph representation coupled with Transformer architecture improves the multi-task performances compared to other baselines including recent discrete tokenization, and provides better prior knowledge for zero-shot transfer or sample efficiency in downstream multi-task imitation learning.

One approach to understanding emergence is to find the continuous \\textit{progress measures} that underlie the seemingly discontinuous qualitative changes. In this work, we argue that progress measures can be found via mechanistic interpretability---that is, by reverse engineering learned models into components and measuring the progress of each component over the course of training. As a case study, we study small transformers trained on a modular arithmetic tasks with emergent grokking behavior. We fully reverse engineer the algorithm learned by these networks, which uses discrete fourier transforms and trigonometric identities to convert addition to rotation about a circle. After confirming the algorithm via ablation, we then use our understanding of the algorithm to define progress measures that precede the grokking phase transition on this task. We see our result as demonstrating both that it is possible to fully reverse engineer trained networks, and that doing so can be invaluable to understanding their training dynamics",

We address this question within the goal-conditioned reinforcement learning paradigm, by identifying how the agent should set its goals at training time to maximize exploration. We propose \"Planning Exploratory Goals\" (PEG), a method that sets goals for each training episode to directly optimize an intrinsic exploration reward. PEG first chooses goal commands such that the agent's goal-conditioned policy, at its current level of training, will end up in states with high exploration potential. It then launches an exploration policy starting at those promising states. To enable this direct optimization, PEG learns world models and adapts sampling-based planning algorithms to \"plan goal commands\". In challenging simulated robotics environments including a multi-legged ant robot in a maze, and a robot arm on a cluttered tabletop, PEG exploration enables more efficient and effective training of goal-conditioned policies relative to baselines and ablations.

    "volume": "spotlight",
    "abstract": "Partial Observability---where agents can only observe partial information about the true underlying state of the system---is ubiquitous in real-world applications of Reinforcement Learning (RL). Theoretically, learning a near-optimal policy under partial observability is known to be hard in the worst case due to an exponential sample complexity lower bound. Recent work has identified several tractable subclasses that are learnable with polynomial samples, such as Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs) with certain revealing or decodability conditions. However, this line of research is still in its infancy, where (1) unified structural conditions enabling sample-efficient learning are lacking; (2) existing sample complexities for known tractable subclasses are far from sharp; and (3) fewer sample-efficient algorithms are available than in fully observable RL. This paper advances all three aspects above for Partially Observable RL in the general setting of Predictive State Representations (PSRs). First, we propose a natural and unified structural condition for PSRs called \\emph{B-stability}. B-stable PSRs encompasses the vast majority of known tractable subclasses such as weakly revealing POMDPs, low-rank future-sufficient POMDPs, decodable POMDPs, and regular PSRs. Next, we show that any B-stable PSR can be learned with polynomial samples in relevant problem parameters. When instantiated in the aforementioned subclasses, our sample complexities improve substantially over the current best ones. Finally, our results are achieved by three algorithms simultaneously: Optimistic Maximum Likelihood Estimation, Estimation-to-Decisions, and Model-Based Optimistic Posterior Sampling. The latter two algorithms are new for sample-efficient learning of POMDPs/PSRs. We additionally design a variant of the Estimation-to-Decisions algorithm to perform sample-efficient \\emph{all-policy model estimation} for B-stable PSRs, which also yields guarantees for reward-free learning as an implication",

In this paper, we formulate DG as a sample selection problem where each domain is sampled from a common underlying population through non-random sampling probabilities that correlate with both the features and the outcome. Under this setting, the fundamental iid assumption of the empirical risk minimization (ERM) is violated, so it often performs worse on test domains whose non-random sampling probabilities differ from the domains in the training dataset. We propose a Selection-Guided DG (SGDG) framework to learn the selection probability of each domain and the joint distribution of the outcome and domain selection variables. The proposed SGDG is domain generalizable as it intends to minimize the risk under the population distribution. We theoretically proved that, under certain regular conditions, SGDG can achieve smaller risk than ERM. Furthermore, we present a class of parametric SGDG (HeckmanDG) estimators applicable to continuous, binary, and multinomial outcomes.

We obtain task-averaged regret guarantees for the reward maximization (optimality gap) and constraint violations using gradient-based meta-learning and show that the task-averaged optimality gap and constraint satisfaction improve with task-similarity in the static environment, or task-relatedness in the changing environment. Several technical challenges arise when making this framework practical while still having strong theoretical guarantees. To address these challenges, we propose a meta-algorithm that performs inexact online learning on the upper bounds of intra-task optimality gap and constraint violations estimated by off-policy stationary distribution corrections. Furthermore, we enable the learning rates to be adapted for every task and extend our approach to settings with the dynamically changing task environments. Finally, experiments are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. The proposed theoretical framework is the first to handle the nonconvexity and stochastic nature of within-task CMDPs, while exploiting inter-task dependency for multi-task safe learning",

    "abstract": "Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) are one of the most popular architectures that are used to solve classification problems accompanied by graphical information. We present a rigorous theoretical understanding of the effects of graph convolutions in multi-layer networks. We study these effects through the node classification problem of a non-linearly separable Gaussian mixture model coupled with a stochastic block model. First, we show that a single graph convolution expands the regime of the distance between the means where multi-layer networks can classify the data by a factor of at least $1/\\sqrt[4]{\\rm deg}$, where ${\\rm deg}$ denotes the expected degree of a node. Second, we show that with a slightly stronger graph density, two graph convolutions improve this factor to at least $1/\\sqrt[4]{n}$, where $n$ is the number of nodes in the graph. Finally, we provide both theoretical and empirical insights into the performance of graph convolutions placed in different combinations among the layers of a neural network, concluding that the performance is mutually similar for all combinations of the placement. We present extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world data that illustrate our results",

    "title": "Post-hoc Concept Bottleneck Models",
    "volume": "spotlight",
    "abstract": "Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) map the inputs onto a set of interpretable concepts (``the bottleneck'') and use the concepts to make predictions. A concept bottleneck enhances interpretability since it can be investigated to understand what concepts the model \"sees\" in an input and which of these concepts are deemed important. However, CBMs are restrictive in practice as they require dense concept annotations in the training data to learn the bottleneck. Moreover, CBMs often do not match the accuracy of an unrestricted neural network, reducing the incentive to deploy them in practice. In this work, we address these limitations of CBMs by introducing Post-hoc Concept Bottleneck models (PCBMs). We show that we can turn any neural network into a PCBM without sacrificing model performance while still retaining the interpretability benefits. When concept annotations are not available on the training data, we show that PCBM can transfer concepts from other datasets or from natural language descriptions of concepts via multimodal models. A key benefit of PCBM is that it enables users to quickly debug and update the model to reduce spurious correlations and improve generalization to new distributions. PCBM allows for global model edits, which can be more efficient than previous works on local interventions that fix a specific prediction. Through a model-editing user study, we show that editing PCBMs via concept-level feedback can provide significant performance gains without using data from the target domain or model retraining",

    "abstract": "Recent state-of-the-art source-free domain adaptation (SFDA) methods have focused on learning meaningful cluster structures in the feature space, which have succeeded in adapting the knowledge from source domain to unlabeled target domain without accessing the private source data. However, existing methods rely on the pseudo-labels generated by source models that can be noisy due to domain shift. In this paper, we study SFDA from the perspective of learning with label noise (LLN). Unlike the label noise in the conventional LLN scenario, we prove that the label noise in SFDA follows a different distribution assumption. We also prove that such a difference makes existing LLN methods that rely on their distribution assumptions unable to address the label noise in SFDA. Empirical evidence suggests that only marginal improvements are achieved when applying the existing LLN methods to solve the SFDA problem. On the other hand, although there exists a fundamental difference between the label noise in the two scenarios, we demonstrate theoretically that the early-time training phenomenon (ETP), which has been previously observed in conventional label noise settings, can also be observed in the SFDA problem. Extensive experiments demonstrate significant improvements to existing SFDA algorithms by leveraging ETP to address the label noise in SFDA",

We prove that the first-layer weights in the NN converge to the $k$-dimensional principal subspace spanned by the vectors $\\boldsymbol{u_1},...,\\boldsymbol{u_k}$ of the true model, when online SGD with weight decay is used for training. This phenomenon has several important consequences when $k \\ll d$. First, by employing uniform convergence on this smaller subspace, we establish a generalization error bound of $\\mathcal{O}(\\sqrt{{kd}/{T}})$ after $T$ iterations of SGD, which is independent of the width of the NN. We further demonstrate that, by recovering the principal direction, SGD-trained ReLU NNs can learn a single-index target of the form $y=f(\\langle\\boldsymbol{u},\\boldsymbol{x}\\rangle) + \\epsilon$ with a sample complexity linear in $d$ (up to log factors), where $f$ is a monotonic function with at most polynomial growth, and $\\epsilon$ is the noise. This is in contrast to the known $d^{\\Omega(p)}$ samples required to learn any degree $p$ polynomial in the kernel regime, and shows that SGD-trained NNs can outperform the Neural Tangent Kernel at initialization.

    "volume": "spotlight",
    "abstract": "A zero-shot RL agent is an agent that can solve any RL task in a given environment, instantly with no additional planning or learning, after an initial reward-free learning phase. This marks a shift from the reward-centric RL paradigm towards controllable agents that can follow arbitrary instructions in an environment. Current RL agents can solve families of related tasks at best, or require planning anew for each task. Strategies for approximate zero-shot RL have been suggested using successor features (SFs) (Borsa et al., 2018) or forward-backward (FB) representations (Touati & Ollivier, 2021), but testing has been limited. After clarifying the relationships between these schemes, we introduce improved losses and new SF models, and test the viability of zero-shot RL schemes systematically on tasks from the Unsupervised RL benchmark (Laskin et al., 2021). To disentangle universal representation learning from exploration, we work in an offline setting and repeat the tests on several existing replay buffers. SFs appear to suffer from the choice of the elementary state features. SFs with Laplacian eigenfunctions do well, while SFs based on auto-encoders, inverse curiosity, transition models, low-rank transition matrix, contrastive learning, or diversity (APS), perform unconsistently. In contrast, FB representations jointly learn the elementary and successor features from a single, principled criterion. They perform best and consistently across the board, reaching $85\\%$ of supervised RL performance with a good replay buffer, in a zero-shot manner",

Consequently, encoding features that capture the hierarchical relationships between states into the model's latent representations is often conducive to recovering effective policies. In this work, we study a new class of deep RL algorithms that promote encoding such relationships by using hyperbolic space to model latent representations. However, we find that a naive application of existing methodology from the hyperbolic deep learning literature leads to fatal instabilities due to the non-stationarity and variance characterizing common gradient estimators in RL. Hence, we design a new general method that directly addresses such optimization challenges and enables stable end-to-end learning with deep hyperbolic representations. We empirically validate our framework by applying it to popular on-policy and off-policy RL algorithms on the Procgen and Atari 100K benchmarks, attaining near universal performance and generalization benefits.

    "title": "Learning Controllable Adaptive Simulation for Multi-resolution Physics",

    "abstract": "Simulating the time evolution of physical systems is pivotal in many scientific and engineering problems. An open challenge in simulating such systems is their multi-resolution dynamics: a small fraction of the system is extremely dynamic, and requires very fine-grained resolution, while a majority of the system is changing slowly and can be modeled by coarser spatial scales. Typical learning-based surrogate models use a uniform spatial scale, which needs to resolve to the finest required scale and can waste a huge compute to achieve required accuracy. In this work, we introduce Learning controllable Adaptive simulation for Multi-resolution Physics (LAMP) as the first full deep learning-based surrogate model that jointly learns the evolution model and optimizes appropriate spatial resolutions that devote more compute to the highly dynamic regions. LAMP consists of a Graph Neural Network (GNN) for learning the forward evolution, and a GNN-based actor-critic for learning the policy of spatial refinement and coarsening. We introduce learning techniques that optimizes LAMP with weighted sum of error and computational cost as objective, allowing LAMP to adapt to varying relative importance of error vs. computation tradeoff at inference time. We evaluate our method in a 1D benchmark of nonlinear PDEs and a challenging 2D mesh-based simulation. We demonstrate that our LAMP outperforms state-of-the-art deep learning surrogate models, and can adaptively trade-off computation to improve long-term prediction error: it achieves an average of 33.7% error reduction for 1D nonlinear PDEs, and outperforms MeshGraphNets + classical Adaptive Mesh Refinement (AMR) in 2D mesh-based simulations.

    "abstract": "An oft-cited challenge of federated learning is the presence of heterogeneity. \\emph{Data heterogeneity} refers to the fact that data from different clients may follow very different distributions. \\emph{System heterogeneity} refers to client devices having different system capabilities. A considerable number of federated optimization methods address this challenge. In the literature, empirical evaluations usually start federated training from random initialization. However, in many practical applications of federated learning, the server has access to proxy data for the training task that can be used to pre-train a model before starting federated training. Using four standard federated learning benchmark datasets, we empirically study the impact of starting from a pre-trained model in federated learning. Unsurprisingly, starting from a pre-trained model reduces the training time required to reach a target error rate and enables the training of more accurate models (up to 40\\%) than is possible when starting from random initialization. Surprisingly, we also find that starting federated learning from a pre-trained initialization reduces the effect of both data and system heterogeneity. We recommend future work proposing and evaluating federated optimization methods to evaluate the performance when starting from random and pre-trained initializations. This study raises several questions for further work on understanding the role of heterogeneity in federated optimization",

    "abstract": "Indiscriminate data poisoning can decrease the clean test accuracy of a deep learning model by slightly perturbing its training samples. There is a consensus that such poisons can hardly harm adversarially-trained (AT) models when the adversarial training budget is no less than the poison budget, i.e., $\\epsilon_\\mathrm{adv}\\geq\\epsilon_\\mathrm{poi}$. This consensus, however, is challenged in this paper based on our new attack strategy that induces \\textit{entangled features} (EntF). The existence of entangled features makes the poisoned data become less useful for training a model, no matter if AT is applied or not. We demonstrate that for attacking a CIFAR-10 AT model under a reasonable setting with $\\epsilon_\\mathrm{adv}=\\epsilon_\\mathrm{poi}=8/255$, our EntF yields an accuracy drop of $13.31\\%$, which is $7\\times$ better than existing methods and equal to discarding $83\\%$ training data. We further show the generalizability of EntF to more challenging settings, e.g., higher AT budgets, partial poisoning, unseen model architectures, and stronger (ensemble or adaptive) defenses. We finally provide new insights into the distinct roles of non-robust vs. robust features in poisoning standard vs. AT models and demonstrate the possibility of using a hybrid attack to poison standard and AT models simultaneously.

In this paper, we expand this learning paradigm to stochastic orders, namely, the convex or Choquet order between probability measures. Towards this end, exploiting the relation between convex orders and optimal transport, we introduce the Choquet-Toland distance between probability measures, that can be used as a drop-in replacement for IPMs. We also introduce the Variational Dominance Criterion (VDC) to learn probability measures with dominance constraints, that encode the desired stochastic order between the learned measure and a known baseline. We analyze both quantities and show that they suffer from the curse of dimensionality and propose surrogates via input convex maxout networks (ICMNs), that enjoy parametric rates. We provide a min-max framework for learning with stochastic orders and validate it experimentally on synthetic and high-dimensional image generation, with promising results.

This has motivated a growing number of bias mitigation algorithms that aim to address fairness issues in machine learning. However, it is difficult to compare their effectiveness in medical imaging for two reasons. First, there is little consensus on the criteria to assess fairness. Second, existing bias mitigation algorithms are developed under different settings, e.g., datasets, model selection strategies, backbones, and fairness metrics, making a direct comparison and evaluation based on existing results impossible. In this work, we introduce MEDFAIR, a framework to benchmark the fairness of machine learning models for medical imaging. MEDFAIR covers eleven algorithms from various categories, ten datasets from different imaging modalities, and three model selection criteria. Through extensive experiments, we find that the under-studied issue of model selection criterion can have a significant impact on fairness outcomes; while in contrast, state-of-the-art bias mitigation algorithms do not significantly improve fairness outcomes over empirical risk minimization (ERM) in both in-distribution and out-of-distribution settings. We evaluate fairness from various perspectives and make recommendations for different medical application scenarios that require different ethical principles.

    "abstract": "As neural networks get larger and costlier, it is important to find sparse networks that require less compute and memory but can be trained to the same accuracy as the full network (i.e. matching). Iterative magnitude pruning (IMP) is a state of the art algorithm that can find such highly sparse matching subnetworks, known as winning tickets. IMP iterates through cycles of training, pruning a fraction of smallest magnitude weights, rewinding unpruned weights back to an early training point, and repeating. Despite its simplicity, the principles underlying when and how IMP finds winning tickets remain elusive. In particular, what useful information does an IMP mask found at the end of training convey to a rewound network near the beginning of training? How does SGD allow the network to extract this information? And why is iterative pruning needed, i.e. why can't we prune to very high sparsities in one shot? We investigate these questions through the lens of the geometry of the error landscape. First, we find that—at higher sparsities—pairs of pruned networks at successive pruning iterations are connected by a linear path with zero error barrier if and only if they are matching. This indicates that masks found at the end of training convey to the rewind point the identity of an axial subspace that intersects a desired linearly connected mode of a matching sublevel set. Second, we show SGD can exploit this information due to a strong form of robustness: it can return to this mode despite strong perturbations early in training. Third, we show how the flatness of the error landscape at the end of training limits the fraction of weights that can be pruned at each iteration of IMP. This analysis yields a new quantitative link between IMP performance and the Hessian eigenspectrum. Finally, we show that the role of retraining in IMP is to find a network with new small weights to prune. Overall, these results make progress toward demystifying the existence of winning tickets by revealing the fundamental role of error landscape geometry in the algorithms used to find them",

We describe three log-linear relationships that quantify the degree to which LMs emit memorized training data. Memorization significantly grows as we increase (1) the capacity of a model, (2) the number of times an example has been duplicated, and (3) the number of tokens of context used to prompt the model. Surprisingly, we find the situation becomes complicated when generalizing these results across model families.

Much work has shown that high-performing ML classifiers can degrade significantly and provide overly-confident, wrong classification predictions, particularly for out-of-distribution (OOD) inputs. Conditional language models (CLMs) are predominantly trained to classify the next token in an output sequence, and may suffer even worse degradation on OOD inputs as the prediction is done auto-regressively over many steps. Furthermore, the space of potential low-quality outputs is larger as arbitrary text can be generated and it is important to know when to trust the generated output. We present a highly accurate and lightweight OOD detection method for CLMs, and demonstrate its effectiveness on abstractive summarization and translation. We also show how our method can be used under the common and realistic setting of distribution shift for selective generation (analogous to selective prediction for classification) of high-quality outputs, while automatically abstaining from low-quality ones, enabling safer deployment of generative language models",

    "title": "Differentially Private $L_2$-Heavy Hitters in the Sliding Window Model",
    "volume": "spotlight",
    "abstract": "The data management of large companies often prioritize more recent data, as a source of higher accuracy prediction than outdated data. For example, the Facebook data policy retains user search histories for $6$ months while the Google data retention policy states that browser information may be stored for up to $9$ months. These policies are captured by the sliding window model, in which only the most recent $W$ statistics form the underlying dataset. In this paper, we consider the problem of privately releasing the $L_2$-heavy hitters in the sliding window model, which include $L_p$-heavy hitters for $p\\le 2$ and in some sense are the strongest possible guarantees that can be achieved using polylogarithmic space, but cannot be handled by existing techniques due to the sub-additivity of the $L_2$ norm. Moreover, existing non-private sliding window algorithms use the smooth histogram framework, which has high sensitivity. To overcome these barriers, we introduce the first differentially private algorithm for $L_2$-heavy hitters in the sliding window model by initiating a number of $L_2$-heavy hitter algorithms across the stream with significantly lower threshold. Similarly, we augment the algorithms with an approximate frequency tracking algorithm with significantly higher accuracy. We then use smooth sensitivity and statistical distance arguments to show that we can add noise proportional to an estimation of the $L_2$ norm. To the best of our knowledge, our techniques are the first to privately release statistics that are related to a sub-additive function in the sliding window model, and may be of independent interest to future differentially private algorithmic design in the sliding window model",

    "abstract": "Neural Motion Planners (NMPs) have emerged as a promising tool for solving robot navigation tasks in complex environments. However, these methods often require expert data for learning, which limits their application to scenarios where data generation is time-consuming. Recent developments have also led to physics-informed deep neural models capable of representing complex dynamical Partial Differential Equations (PDEs). Inspired by these developments, we propose Neural Time Fields (NTFields) for robot motion planning in cluttered scenarios. Our framework represents a wave propagation model generating continuous arrival time to find path solutions informed by a nonlinear first-order PDE called Eikonal Equation. We evaluate our method in various cluttered 3D environments, including the Gibson dataset, and demonstrate its ability to solve motion planning problems for 4-DOF and 6-DOF robot manipulators where the traditional grid-based Eikonal planners often face the curse of dimensionality. Furthermore, the results show that our method exhibits high success rates and significantly lower computational times than the state-of-the-art methods, including NMPs that require training data from classical planners",

In this article, we propose DiffEdit, a method to take advantage of text-conditioned diffusion models for the task of semantic image editing, where the goal is to edit an image based on a text query. Semantic image editing is an extension of image generation, with the additional constraint that the generated image should be as similar as possible to a given input image. Current editing methods based on diffusion models usually require to provide a mask, making the task much easier by treating it as a conditional inpainting task. In contrast, our main contribution is able to automatically generate a mask highlighting regions of the input image that need to be edited, by contrasting predictions of a diffusion model conditioned on different text prompts. Moreover, we rely on latent inference to preserve content in those regions of interest and show excellent synergies with mask-based diffusion. DiffEdit achieves state-of-the-art editing performance on ImageNet. In addition, we evaluate semantic image editing in more challenging settings, using images from the COCO dataset as well as text-based generated images",

    "volume": "spotlight",
    "abstract": "Evaluation metrics in image synthesis play a key role to measure performances of generative models. However, most metrics mainly focus on image fidelity. Existing diversity metrics are derived by comparing distributions, and thus they cannot quantify the diversity or rarity degree of each generated image. In this work, we propose a new evaluation metric, called `rarity score', to measure both image-wise uncommonness and model-wise diversified generation performance. We first show empirical observation that typical samples are close to each other and distinctive samples are far from each other in nearest-neighbor distances on latent spaces represented by feature extractor networks such as VGG16. We then show that one can effectively filter typical or distinctive samples with the proposed metric. We also use our metric to demonstrate that the extent to which different generative models produce rare images can be effectively compared. Further, our metric can be used to compare rarities between datasets that share the same concept such as CelebA-HQ and FFHQ. Finally, we analyze the use of metrics in different designs of feature extractors to better understand the relationship between feature spaces and resulting high-rarity images. Code will be publicly available for the research community",

    "abstract": "We introduce Corrupted Image Modeling (CIM) for self-supervised visual pre-training. CIM uses an auxiliary generator with a small trainable BEiT to corrupt the input image instead of using artificial [MASK] tokens, where some patches are randomly selected and replaced with plausible alternatives sampled from the BEiT output distribution. Given this corrupted image, an enhancer network learns to either recover all the original image pixels, or predict whether each visual token is replaced by a generator sample or not. The generator and the enhancer are simultaneously trained and synergistically updated. After pre-training, the enhancer can be used as a high-capacity visual encoder for downstream tasks. CIM is a general and flexible visual pre-training framework that is suitable for various network architectures. For the first time, CIM demonstrates that both ViT and CNN can learn rich visual representations using a unified, non-Siamese framework.

However, due to the intractable densities of variational distributions, current SIVI approaches often use surrogate evidence lower bounds (ELBOs) or employ expensive inner-loop MCMC runs for unbiased ELBOs for training. In this paper, we propose SIVI-SM, a new method for SIVI based on an alternative training objective via score matching. Leveraging the hierarchical structure of semi-implicit variational families, the score matching objective allows a minimax formulation where the intractable variational densities can be naturally handled with denoising score matching. We show that SIVI-SM closely matches the accuracy of MCMC and outperforms ELBO-based SIVI methods in a variety of Bayesian inference tasks",

    "title": "Exploring Temporally Dynamic Data Augmentation for Video Recognition",
    "volume": "spotlight",
    "abstract": "Data augmentation has recently emerged as an essential component of modern training recipes for visual recognition tasks. However, data augmentation for video recognition has been rarely explored despite its effectiveness. Few existing augmentation recipes for video recognition naively extend the image augmentation methods by applying the same operations to the whole video frames. Our main idea is that the magnitude of augmentation operations for each frame needs to be changed over time to capture the real-world video's temporal variations. These variations should be generated as diverse as possible using fewer additional hyper-parameters during training. Through this motivation, we propose a simple yet effective video data augmentation framework, DynaAugment. The magnitude of augmentation operations on each frame is changed by an effective mechanism, Fourier Sampling that parameterizes diverse, smooth, and realistic temporal variations. DynaAugment also includes an extended search space suitable for video for automatic data augmentation methods. DynaAugment experimentally demonstrates that there are additional performance rooms to be improved from static augmentations on diverse video models. Specifically, we show the effectiveness of DynaAugment on various video datasets and tasks: large-scale video recognition (Kinetics-400 and Something-Something-v2), small-scale video recognition (UCF-101 and HMDB-51), fine-grained video recognition (Diving-48 and FineGym), video action segmentation on Breakfast, video action localization on THUMOS'14, and video object detection on MOT17Det",

In this paper, we propose a general framework that unifies model-based and model-free RL, and an Admissible Bellman Characterization (ABC) class that subsumes nearly all Markov decision process (MDP) models in the literature for tractable RL. We propose a novel estimation function with decomposable structural properties for optimization-based exploration and the functional Eluder dimension as a complexity measure of the ABC class. Under our framework, a new sample-efficient algorithm namely OPtimization-based ExploRation with Approximation (OPERA) is proposed, achieving regret bounds that match or improve over the best-known results for a variety of MDP models. In particular, for MDPs with low Witness rank, under a slightly stronger assumption, OPERA improves the state-of-the-art sample complexity results by a factor of $dH$.

    "abstract": "We study a security threat to adversarial multi-armed bandit, in which an attacker perturbs the loss or reward signal to control the behavior of the victim bandit player. We show that the attacker is able to mislead any no-regret adversarial bandit algorithm into selecting a suboptimal target action in every but sublinear (T−o(T )) number of rounds, while incurring only sublinear (o(T)) cumulative attack cost. This result implies critical security concern in real-world bandit-based systems, e.g., in online recommendation, an attacker might be able to hijack the recommender system and promote a desired product. Our proposed attack algorithms require knowledge of only the regret rate, thus are agnostic to the concrete bandit algorithm employed by the victim player. We also derived a theoretical lower bound on the cumulative attack cost that any victim-agnostic attack algorithm must incur. The lower bound matches the upper bound achieved by our attack, which shows that our attack is asymptotically optimal",

Without loss of generality, we focus on problems with only inequality constraints. We systematically calibrate the inequality constraints used in training, thereby anticipating DNN prediction errors and ensuring the obtained solutions remain feasible. We characterize the calibration rate and a critical DNN size, based on which we can directly construct a DNN with provable solution feasibility guarantee. We further propose an Adversarial-Sample Aware training algorithm to improve its optimality performance. We apply the framework to develop DeepOPF+ for solving essential DC optimal power flow problems in grid operation. Simulation results over IEEE test cases show that it outperforms existing strong DNN baselines in ensuring 100\\% feasibility and attaining consistent optimality loss (<0.19%) and speedup (up to x228) in both light-load and heavy-load regimes, as compared to a state-of-the-art solver.

    "title": "LightGCL: Simple Yet Effective Graph Contrastive Learning for Recommendation",
    "volume": "spotlight",
    "abstract": "Graph neural network (GNN) is a powerful learning approach for graph-based recommender systems. Recently, GNNs integrated with contrastive learning have shown superior performance in recommendation with their data augmentation schemes, aiming at dealing with highly sparse data. Despite their success, most existing graph contrastive learning methods either perform stochastic augmentation (e.g., node/edge perturbation) on the user-item interaction graph, or rely on the heuristic-based augmentation techniques (e.g., user clustering) for generating contrastive views. We argue that these methods cannot well preserve the intrinsic semantic structures and are easily biased by the noise perturbation. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective graph contrastive learning paradigm LightGCL that mitigates these issues impairing the generality and robustness of CL-based recommenders. Our model exclusively utilizes singular value decomposition for contrastive augmentation, which enables the unconstrained structural refinement with global collaborative relation modeling. Experiments conducted on several benchmark datasets demonstrate the significant improvement in performance of our model over the state-of-the-arts. Further analyses demonstrate the superiority of LightGCL's robustness against data sparsity and popularity bias. The source code of our model is available at https://github.com/HKUDS/LightGCL",

    "title": "MIMT: Masked Image Modeling Transformer for Video Compression",
    "volume": "spotlight",
    "abstract": "Deep learning video compression outperforms its hand-craft counterparts with enhanced flexibility and capacity. One key component of the learned video codec is the autoregressive entropy model conditioned on spatial and temporal priors. Operating autoregressive on raster scanning order naively treats the context as unidirectional. This is neither efficient nor optimal, considering that conditional information probably locates at the end of the sequence. We thus introduce an entropy model based on a masked image modeling transformer (MIMT) to learn the spatial-temporal dependencies. Video frames are first encoded into sequences of tokens and then processed with the transformer encoder as priors. The transformer decoder learns the probability mass functions (PMFs) \\emph{conditioned} on the priors and masked inputs. Then it is capable of selecting optimal decoding orders without a fixed direction. During training, MIMT aims to predict the PMFs of randomly masked tokens by attending to tokens in all directions. This allows MIMT to capture the temporal dependencies from encoded priors and the spatial dependencies from the unmasked tokens, i.e., decoded tokens. At inference time, the model begins with generating PMFs of all masked tokens in parallel and then decodes the frame iteratively from the previously-selected decoded tokens (i.e., with high confidence). In addition, we improve the overall performance with more techniques, e.g., manifold conditional priors accumulating a long range of information, shifted window attention to reduce complexity. Extensive experiments demonstrate the proposed MIMT framework equipped with the new transformer entropy model achieves state-of-the-art performance on HEVC, UVG, and MCL-JCV datasets, generally outperforming the VVC in terms of PSNR and SSIM",

    "volume": "spotlight",
    "abstract": "State space models (SSMs) have demonstrated state-of-the-art sequence modeling performance in some modalities, but underperform attention in language modeling. Moreover, despite scaling nearly linearly in sequence length instead of quadratically, SSMs are still slower than Transformers due to poor hardware utilization. In this paper, we make progress on understanding the expressivity gap between SSMs and attention in language modeling, and on reducing the hardware barrier between SSMs and attention. First, we use synthetic language modeling tasks to understand the gap between SSMs and attention. We find that existing SSMs struggle with two capabilities: recalling earlier tokens in the sequence and comparing tokens across the sequence. To understand the impact on language modeling, we propose a new SSM layer, H3, that is explicitly designed for these abilities. H3 matches attention on the synthetic languages and comes within 0.4 PPL of Transformers on OpenWebText. Furthermore, a hybrid 125M-parameter H3-attention model that retains two attention layers surprisingly outperforms Transformers on OpenWebText by 1.0 PPL. Next, to improve the efficiency of training SSMs on modern hardware, we propose FlashConv. FlashConv uses a fused block FFT algorithm to improve efficiency on sequences up to 8K, and introduces a novel state passing algorithm that exploits the recurrent properties of SSMs to scale to longer sequences. FlashConv yields 2$\\times$ speedup on the long-range arena benchmark and allows hybrid language models to generate text 2.4$\\times$ faster than Transformers. Using FlashConv, we scale hybrid H3-attention language models up to 2.7B parameters on the Pile and find promising initial results, achieving lower perplexity than Transformers and outperforming Transformers in zero- and few-shot learning on a majority of tasks in the SuperGLUE benchmark",

    "abstract": "Neural message passing is a basic feature extraction unit for graph-structured data considering neighboring node features in network propagation from one layer to the next. We model such process by an interacting particle system with attractive and repulsive forces and the Allen-Cahn force arising in the modeling of phase transition. The dynamics of the system is a reaction-diffusion process which can separate particles without blowing up. This induces an Allen-Cahn message passing (ACMP) for graph neural networks where the numerical iteration for the particle system solution constitutes the message passing propagation. ACMP which has a simple implementation with a neural ODE solver can propel the network depth up to one hundred of layers with theoretically proven strictly positive lower bound of the Dirichlet energy. It thus provides a deep model of GNNs circumventing the common GNN problem of oversmoothing. GNNs with ACMP achieve state of the art performance for real-world node classification tasks on both homophilic and heterophilic datasets. Codes are available at https://github.com/ykiiiiii/ACMP",

As set processors, transformers are at a disadvantage in reasoning over more general graph-structured data where nodes represent entities and edges represent relations between entities. To address this shortcoming, we generalize transformer attention to consider and update edge vectors in each transformer layer. We evaluate this relational transformer on a diverse array of graph-structured tasks, including the large and challenging CLRS Algorithmic Reasoning Benchmark. There, it dramatically outperforms state-of-the-art graph neural networks expressly designed to reason over graph-structured data. Our analysis demonstrates that these gains are attributable to relational attention's inherent ability to leverage the greater expressivity of graphs over sets",

Utilizing the symmetry, our method can find a shadowing representative of the true assignment and the number of tested assignments in the alternative is largely reduced. In theory, we introduce a combinatorial distance between two community classes and show a combinatorial-probabilistic trade-off phenomenon. Our test is honest as long as the product of the combinatorial distance between two communities and the probabilistic distance between two connection probabilities is sufficiently large. Besides, we show that such trade-off also exists in the information-theoretic lower bound. We also implement numerical experiments to show the validity of our method",

Previous works develop near-optimal accelerated algorithms for minimizing this class of functions, however, they require a subroutine of binary search which results in multiple calls to gradient evaluations in each iteration, and consequently the total number of gradient evaluations does not match a known lower bound. In this work, we show that a recently proposed continuized Nesterov acceleration can be applied to minimizing quasar convex functions and achieves the optimal bound with a high probability. Furthermore, we find that the objective functions of training generalized linear models (GLMs) satisfy quasar convexity, which broadens the applicability of the relevant algorithms, while known practical examples of quasar convexity in non-convex learning are sparse in the literature. We also show that if a smooth and one-point strongly convex, Polyak-Lojasiewicz, or quadratic-growth function satisfies quasar convexity, then attaining an accelerated linear rate for minimizing the function is possible under certain conditions, while acceleration is not known in general for these classes of functions",

We consider the setting where the reward function is given, and the constraints are unknown, and propose a method that is able to recover these constraints satisfactorily from the expert data. While previous work has focused on recovering hard constraints, our method can recover cumulative soft constraints that the agent satisfies on average per episode. In IRL fashion, our method solves this problem by adjusting the constraint function iteratively through a constrained optimization procedure, until the agent behavior matches the expert behavior.

    "abstract": "Scaling transformers has led to significant breakthroughs in many domains, leading to a paradigm in which larger versions of existing models are trained and released on a periodic basis. New instances of such models are typically trained completely from scratch, despite the fact that they are often just scaled-up versions of their smaller counterparts. How can we use the implicit knowledge in the parameters of smaller, extant models to enable faster training of newer, larger models? This paper describes an approach for accelerating transformer training by learning to grow pretrained transformers, where we learn to linearly map the parameters of the smaller model to initialize the larger model. For tractable learning, we factorize the linear transformation as a composition of (linear) width- and depth-growth operators, and further employ a Kronecker factorization of these growth operators to encode architectural knowledge. Extensive experiments across both language and vision transformers demonstrate that our learned Linear Growth Operator (LiGO) can save up to 50% computational cost of training from scratch, while also consistently outperforming strong baselines that also reuse smaller pretrained models to initialize larger models",

To mitigate this problem, many approaches have aimed to balance among given classes by re-weighting or re-sampling training samples. These re-balancing methods increase the impact of minority classes and reduce the influence of majority classes on the output of models. However, the extracted representations may be of poor quality owing to the limited number of minority samples. To handle this restriction, several methods have been developed that increase the representations of minority samples by leveraging the features of the majority samples. Despite extensive recent studies, no deep analysis has been conducted on determination of classes to be augmented and strength of augmentation has been conducted. In this study, we first investigate the correlation between the degree of augmentation and class-wise performance, and find that the proper degree of augmentation must be allocated for each class to mitigate class imbalance problems. Motivated by this finding, we propose a simple and efficient novel curriculum, which is designed to find the appropriate per-class strength of data augmentation, called CUDA: CUrriculum of Data Augmentation for long-tailed recognition. CUDA can simply be integrated into existing long-tailed recognition methods.

We design a retrieval mechanism that retrieves and fuses the exemplar molecules with the input molecule, which is trained by a new self-supervised objective that predicts the nearest neighbor of the input molecule. We also propose an iterative refinement process to dynamically update the generated molecules and retrieval database for better generalization. Our approach is agnostic to the choice of generative models and requires no task-specific fine-tuning.

    "volume": "spotlight",
    "abstract": "We introduce SignNet and BasisNet---new neural architectures that are invariant to two key symmetries displayed by eigenvectors: (i) sign flips, since if v is an eigenvector then so is -v; and (ii) more general basis symmetries, which occur in higher dimensional eigenspaces with infinitely many choices of basis eigenvectors. We prove that under certain conditions our networks are universal, i.e., they can approximate any continuous function of eigenvectors with the desired invariances. When used with Laplacian eigenvectors, our networks are provably more expressive than existing spectral methods on graphs; for instance, they subsume all spectral graph convolutions, certain spectral graph invariants, and previously proposed graph positional encodings as special cases. Experiments show that our networks significantly outperform existing baselines on molecular graph regression, learning expressive graph representations, and learning neural fields on triangle meshes.

    "title": "Sequential Latent Variable Models for Few-Shot High-Dimensional Time-Series Forecasting",
    "volume": "spotlight",
    "abstract": "Modern applications increasingly require learning and forecasting latent dynamics from high-dimensional time-series. Compared to univariate time-series forecasting, this adds a new challenge of reasoning about the latent dynamics of an unobserved abstract state. Sequential latent variable models (LVMs) present an attractive solution, although existing works either struggle with long-term forecasting or have difficulty learning across diverse dynamics. In this paper, we first present a conceptual framework of sequential LVMs to unify existing works, contrast their fundamental limitations, and identify an intuitive solution to long-term forecasting for diverse dynamics via meta-learning. We then present the first framework of few-shot forecasting for high-dimensional time-series: instead of learning a single dynamic function, we leverage data of diverse dynamics and learn to adapt latent dynamic functions to few-shot support series. This is realized via Bayesian meta-learning underpinned by: 1) a latent dynamic function conditioned on knowledge derived from few-shot support series, and 2) a meta-model that learns to extract such dynamic-specific knowledge via feed-forward embedding of support set. We compared the presented framework with a comprehensive set of baseline models trained 1) globally on the large meta-training set with diverse dynamics, and 2) individually on single dynamics, both with and without fine-tuning to k-shot support series used by the meta-models. We demonstrated that the presented framework is agnostic to the latent dynamic function of choice and, at meta-test time, is able to forecast for new dynamics given variable-shot of support series",

    "title": "Code Translation with Compiler Representations",
    "volume": "spotlight",
    "abstract": "In this paper, we leverage low-level compiler intermediate representations (IR) code translation. Traditional transpilers rely on syntactic information and handcrafted rules, which limits their applicability and produces unnatural-looking code. Applying neural machine translation (NMT) approaches to code has successfully broadened the set of programs on which one can get a natural-looking translation. However, they treat the code as sequences of text tokens, and still do not differentiate well enough between similar pieces of code which have different semantics in different languages. The consequence is low quality translation, reducing the practicality of NMT, and stressing the need for an approach significantly increasing its accuracy. Here we propose to augment code translation with IRs, specifically LLVM IR, with results on the C++, Java, Rust, and Go languages. Our method improves upon the state of the art for unsupervised code translation, increasing the number of correct translations by 11% on average, and up to 79% for the Java → Rust pair with greedy decoding. With beam search, it increases the number of correct translations by 5.5% in average. We extend previous test sets for code translation, by adding hundreds of Go and Rust functions. Additionally, we train models with high performance on the problem of IR decompilation, generating programming source code from IR, and study using IRs as intermediary pivot for translation",

We aim to understand grokking by analyzing the loss landscapes of neural networks, identifying the mismatch between training and test losses as the cause for grokking. We refer to this as the \"LU mechanism\" because training and test losses (against model weight norm) typically resemble \"L\" and \"U\", respectively. This simple mechanism can nicely explain many aspects of grokking: data size dependence, weight decay dependence, the emergence of representations, etc. Guided by the intuitive picture, we are able to induce grokking on tasks involving images, language and molecules, although the grokking signals are sometimes less dramatic. We attribute the dramatic nature of grokking for algorithmic datasets to representation learning",

    "abstract": "Normalizing flows are tractable density models that can approximate complicated target distributions, e.g. Boltzmann distributions of physical systems. However, current methods for training flows either suffer from mode-seeking behavior, use samples from the target generated beforehand by expensive MCMC methods, or use stochastic losses that have high variance. To avoid these problems, we augment flows with annealed importance sampling (AIS) and minimize the mass-covering $\\alpha$-divergence with $\\alpha=2$, which minimizes importance weight variance. Our method, Flow AIS Bootstrap (FAB), uses AIS to generate samples in regions where the flow is a poor approximation of the target, facilitating the discovery of new modes. We apply FAB to multimodal targets and show that we can approximate them very accurately where previous methods fail. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to learn the Boltzmann distribution of the alanine dipeptide molecule using only the unnormalized target density, without access to samples generated via Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations: FAB produces better results than training via maximum likelihood on MD samples while using 100 times fewer target evaluations. After reweighting the samples, we obtain unbiased histograms of dihedral angles that are almost identical to the ground truth",

    "abstract": "Limited progress has been made in continual unsupervised learning of representations, especially in reusing, expanding, and continually disentangling learned semantic factors across data environments. We argue that this is because existing approaches treat continually-arrived data independently, without considering how they are related based on the underlying semantic factors. We address this by a new generative model describing a topologically-connected mixture of spike-and-slab distributions in the latent space, learned end-to-end in a continual fashion via principled variational inference. The learned mixture is able to automatically discover the active semantic factors underlying each data environment and to accumulate their relational structure based on that. This distilled knowledge of different data environments can further be used for generative replay and guiding continual disentangling of new semantic factors. We tested the presented method on a split version of 3DShapes to provide the first quantitative disentanglement evaluation of continually learned representations, and further demonstrated its ability to continually disentangle new representations in benchmark datasets",

    "title": "LMC: Fast Training of GNNs via Subgraph Sampling with Provable Convergence",
    "volume": "spotlight",
    "abstract": "The message passing-based graph neural networks (GNNs) have achieved great success in many real-world applications. However, training GNNs on large-scale graphs suffers from the well-known neighbor explosion problem, i.e., the exponentially increasing dependencies of nodes with the number of message passing layers. Subgraph-wise sampling methods---a promising class of mini-batch training techniques---discard messages outside the mini-batches in backward passes to avoid the neighbor explosion problem at the expense of gradient estimation accuracy. This poses significant challenges to their convergence analysis and convergence speeds, which seriously limits their reliable real-world applications. To address this challenge, we propose a novel subgraph-wise sampling method with a convergence guarantee, namely Local Message Compensation (LMC). To the best of our knowledge, LMC is the {\\it first} subgraph-wise sampling method with provable convergence. The key idea of LMC is to retrieve the discarded messages in backward passes based on a message passing formulation of backward passes. By efficient and effective compensations for the discarded messages in both forward and backward passes, LMC computes accurate mini-batch gradients and thus accelerates convergence. We further show that LMC converges to first-order stationary points of GNNs. Experiments on large-scale benchmark tasks demonstrate that LMC significantly outperforms state-of-the-art subgraph-wise sampling methods in terms of efficiency",

    "title": "Programmatically Grounded, Compositionally Generalizable Robotic Manipulation",
    "volume": "spotlight",
    "abstract": "Robots operating in the real world require both rich manipulation skills as well as the ability to semantically reason about when to apply those skills. Towards this goal, recent works have integrated semantic representations from large-scale pretrained vision-language (VL) models into manipulation models, imparting them with more general reasoning capabilities. However, we show that the conventional {\\it pretraining-finetuning} pipeline for integrating such representations entangles the learning of domain-specific action information and domain-general visual information, leading to less data-efficient training and poor generalization to unseen objects and tasks. To this end, we propose \\ours, a {\\it modular} approach to better leverage pretrained VL models by exploiting the syntactic and semantic structures of language instructions. Our framework uses a semantic parser to recover an executable program, composed of functional modules grounded on vision and action across different modalities. Each functional module is realized as a combination of deterministic computation and learnable neural networks. Program execution produces parameters to general manipulation primitives for a robotic end-effector. The entire modular network can be trained with end-to-end imitation learning objectives. Experiments show that our model successfully disentangles action and perception, translating to improved zero-shot and compositional generalization in a variety of manipulation behaviors.

    "abstract": "We show vectorized sketch generation can be identified as a reversal of the stroke deformation process. This relationship was established by means of a diffusion model that learns data distributions over the stroke-point locations and pen states of real human sketches. Given randomly scattered stroke-points, sketch generation becomes a process of deformation-based denoising, where the generator rectifies positions of stroke points at each timestep to converge at a recognizable sketch. A key innovation was to embed recognizability into the reverse time diffusion process. It was observed that the estimated noise during the reversal process is strongly correlated with sketch classification accuracy. An auxiliary recurrent neural network (RNN) was consequently used to quantify recognizability during data sampling. It follows that, based on the recognizability scores, a sampling shortcut function can also be devised that renders better quality sketches with fewer sampling steps. Finally it is shown that the model can be easily extended to a conditional generation framework, where given incomplete and unfaithful sketches, it yields one that is more visually appealing and with higher recognizability",

    "title": "A Model or 603 Exemplars: Towards Memory-Efficient Class-Incremental Learning",
    "volume": "spotlight",
    "abstract": "Real-world applications require the classification model to adapt to new classes without forgetting old ones. Correspondingly, Class-Incremental Learning (CIL) aims to train a model with limited memory size to meet this requirement. Typical CIL methods tend to save representative exemplars from former classes to resist forgetting, while recent works find that storing models from history can substantially boost the performance. However, the stored models are not counted into the memory budget, which implicitly results in unfair comparisons. We find that when counting the model size into the total budget and comparing methods with aligned memory size, saving models do not consistently work, especially for the case with limited memory budgets. As a result, we need to holistically evaluate different CIL methods at different memory scales and simultaneously consider accuracy and memory size for measurement. On the other hand, we dive deeply into the construction of the memory buffer for memory efficiency. By analyzing the effect of different layers in the network, we find that shallow and deep layers have different characteristics in CIL. Motivated by this, we propose a simple yet effective baseline, denoted as MEMO for Memory-efficient Expandable MOdel. MEMO extends specialized layers based on the shared generalized representations, efficiently extracting diverse representations with modest cost and maintaining representative exemplars. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets validate MEMO's competitive performance. Code is available at: https://github.com/wangkiw/ICLR23-MEMO",

    "title": "Learning Label Encodings for Deep Regression",
    "volume": "spotlight",
    "abstract": "Deep regression networks are widely used to tackle the problem of predicting a continuous value for a given input. Task-specialized approaches for training regression networks have shown significant improvement over generic approaches, such as direct regression. More recently, a generic approach based on regression by binary classification using binary-encoded labels has shown significant improvement over direct regression. The space of label encodings for regression is large. Lacking heretofore have been automated approaches to find a good label encoding for a given application. This paper introduces Regularized Label Encoding Learning (RLEL) for end-to-end training of an entire network and its label encoding. RLEL provides a generic approach for tackling regression. Underlying RLEL is our observation that the search space of label encodings can be constrained and efficiently explored by using a continuous search space of real-valued label encodings combined with a regularization function designed to encourage encodings with certain properties. These properties balance the probability of classification error in individual bits against error correction capability. Label encodings found by RLEL result in lower or comparable errors to manually designed label encodings. Applying RLEL results in $10.9\\%$ and $12.4\\%$ improvement in Mean Absolute Error (MAE) over direct regression and multiclass classification, respectively. Our evaluation demonstrates that RLEL can be combined with off-the-shelf feature extractors and is suitable across different architectures, datasets, and tasks.

    "abstract": "We study a modular approach to tackle long-horizon mobile manipulation tasks for object rearrangement, which decomposes a full task into a sequence of subtasks. To tackle the entire task, prior work chains multiple stationary manipulation skills with a point-goal navigation skill, which are learned individually on subtasks. Although more effective than monolithic end-to-end RL policies, this framework suffers from compounding errors in skill chaining, e.g., navigating to a bad location where a stationary manipulation skill can not reach its target to manipulate. To this end, we propose that the manipulation skills should include mobility to have flexibility in interacting with the target object from multiple locations and at the same time the navigation skill could have multiple end points which lead to successful manipulation. We operationalize these ideas by implementing mobile manipulation skills rather than stationary ones and training a navigation skill trained with region goal instead of point goal. We evaluate our multi-skill mobile manipulation method M3 on 3 challenging long-horizon mobile manipulation tasks in the Home Assistant Benchmark (HAB), and show superior performance as compared to the baselines",

FLoRA enables single-shot FL-HPO: identifying a single set of good hyper-parameters that are subsequently used in a single FL training. Thus, it enables FL-HPO solutions with minimal additional communication overhead compared to FL training without HPO. Utilizing standard smoothness assumptions, we theoretically characterize the optimality gap of FLoRA for any convex and non-convex loss functions, which explicitly accounts for the heterogeneous nature of the parties' local data distributions, a dominant characteristic of FL systems. Our empirical evaluation of FLoRA for multiple FL algorithms on seven OpenML datasets demonstrates significant model accuracy improvements over the baselines, and robustness to increasing number of parties involved in FL-HPO training",

    "abstract": "This work investigates a simple yet powerful dense prediction task adapter for Vision Transformer (ViT). Unlike recently advanced variants that incorporate vision-specific inductive biases into their architectures, the plain ViT suffers inferior performance on dense predictions due to weak prior assumptions. To address this issue, we propose the ViT-Adapter, which allows plain ViT to achieve comparable performance to vision-specific transformers. Specifically, the backbone in our framework is a plain ViT that can learn powerful representations from large-scale multi-modal data. When transferring to downstream tasks, a pre-training-free adapter is used to introduce the image-related inductive biases into the model, making it suitable for these tasks. We verify ViT-Adapter on multiple dense prediction tasks, including object detection, instance segmentation, and semantic segmentation. Notably, without using extra detection data, our ViT-Adapter-L yields state-of-the-art 60.9 box AP and 53.0 mask AP on COCO test-dev. We hope that the ViT-Adapter could serve as an alternative for vision-specific transformers and facilitate future research. Code and models will be released at https://github.com/czczup/ViT-Adapter",

    "volume": "spotlight",
    "abstract": "Domain Adaptation of Black-box Predictors (DABP) aims to learn a model on an unlabeled target domain supervised by a black-box predictor trained on a source domain. It does not require access to both the source-domain data and the predictor parameters, thus addressing the data privacy and portability issues of standard domain adaptation methods. Existing DABP approaches mostly rely on knowledge distillation (KD) from the black-box predictor, i.e., training the model with its noisy target-domain predictions, which however inevitably introduces the confirmation bias accumulated from the prediction noises and leads to degrading performance. To mitigate such bias, we propose a new strategy, \\textit{divide-to-adapt}, that purifies cross-domain knowledge distillation by proper domain division. This is inspired by an observation we make for the first time in domain adaptation: the target domain usually contains easy-to-adapt and hard-to-adapt samples that have different levels of domain discrepancy w.r.t. the source domain, and deep models tend to fit easy-to-adapt samples first. Leveraging easy-to-adapt samples with less noise can help KD alleviate the negative effect of prediction noises from black-box predictors. In this sense, the target domain can be divided into an easy-to-adapt subdomain with less noise and a hard-to-adapt subdomain at the early stage of training. Then the adaptation is achieved by semi-supervised learning. We further reduce distribution discrepancy between subdomains and develop weak-strong augmentation strategy to filter the predictor errors progressively. As such, our method is a simple yet effective solution to reduce error accumulation in cross-domain knowledge distillation for DABP. Moreover, we prove that the target error of DABP is bounded by the noise ratio of two subdomains, i.e., the confirmation bias, which provides the theoretical justifications for our method. Extensive experiments demonstrate our method achieves state of the art on all DABP benchmarks, outperforming the existing best approach by 7.0\\% on VisDA-17, and is even comparable with the standard domain adaptation methods that use the source-domain data",

    "abstract": "With the increasing attention to large vision-language models such as CLIP, there has been a significant amount of effort dedicated to building efficient prompts. Unlike conventional methods of only learning one single prompt, we propose to learn multiple comprehensive prompts to describe diverse characteristics of categories such as intrinsic attributes or extrinsic contexts. However, directly matching each prompt to the same visual feature is problematic, as it pushes the prompts to converge to one point. To solve this problem, we propose to apply optimal transport to match the vision and text modalities. Specifically, we first model images and the categories with visual and textual feature sets. Then, we apply a two-stage optimization strategy to learn the prompts. In the inner loop, we optimize the optimal transport distance to align visual features and prompts by the Sinkhorn algorithm, while in the outer loop, we learn the prompts by this distance from the supervised data. Extensive experiments are conducted on the few-shot recognition task and the improvement demonstrates the superiority of our method. The code is available at https://github.com/CHENGY12/PLOT",

    "volume": "spotlight",
    "abstract": "Traditionally, data valuation is posed as a problem of equitably splitting the validation performance of a learning algorithm among the training data. As a result, the calculated data values depend on many design choices of the underlying learning algorithm. However, this dependence is undesirable for many use cases of data valuation, such as setting priorities over different data sources in a data acquisition process and informing pricing mechanisms in a data marketplace. In these scenarios, data needs to be valued before the actual analysis and the choice of the learning algorithm is still undetermined then. Another side-effect of the dependence is that to assess the value of individual points, one needs to re-run the learning algorithm with and without a point, which incurs a large computation burden. This work leapfrogs over the current limits of data valuation methods by introducing a new framework that can value training data in a way that is oblivious to the downstream learning algorithm. Our main results are as follows. $\\textbf{(1)}$ We develop a proxy for the validation performance associated with a training set based on a non-conventional $\\textit{class-wise}$ $\\textit{Wasserstein distance}$ between the training and the validation set. We show that the distance characterizes the upper bound of the validation performance for any given model under certain Lipschitz conditions. $\\textbf{(2)}$ We develop a novel method to value individual data based on the sensitivity analysis of the $\\textit{class-wise}$ Wasserstein distance. Importantly, these values can be directly obtained $\\textit{for free}$ from the output of off-the-shelf optimization solvers once the Wasserstein distance is computed. $\\textbf{(3) }$We evaluate our new data valuation framework over various use cases related to detecting low-quality data and show that, surprisingly, the learning-agnostic feature of our framework enables a $\\textit{significant improvement}$ over the state-of-the-art performance while being $\\textit{orders of magnitude faster.}$",

    "volume": "spotlight",
    "abstract": "Distillation-aware Neural Architecture Search (DaNAS) aims to search for an optimal student architecture that obtains the best performance and/or efficiency when distilling the knowledge from a given teacher model. Previous DaNAS methods have mostly tackled the search for the neural architecture for fixed datasets and the teacher, which are not generalized well on a new task consisting of an unseen dataset and an unseen teacher, thus need to perform a costly search for any new combination of the datasets and the teachers. For standard NAS tasks without KD, meta-learning-based computationally efficient NAS methods have been proposed, which learn the generalized search process over multiple tasks (datasets) and transfer the knowledge obtained over those tasks to a new task. However, since they assume learning from scratch without KD from a teacher, they might not be ideal for DaNAS scenarios. To eliminate the excessive computational cost of DaNAS methods and the sub-optimality of rapid NAS methods, we propose a distillation-aware meta-accuracy prediction model, DaSS (Distillation-aware Student Search), which can predict a given architecture's final performances on a dataset when performing KD with a given teacher, without having actually to train it on the target task. The experimental results demonstrate that our proposed meta-prediction model successfully generalizes to multiple unseen datasets for DaNAS tasks, largely outperforming existing meta-NAS methods and rapid NAS baselines.

Recently, neural decoders have demonstrated their advantage over classical decoding techniques. However, recent state-of-the-art neural decoders suffer from high complexity and lack the important iterative scheme characteristic of many legacy decoders. In this work, we propose to employ denoising diffusion models for the soft decoding of linear codes at arbitrary block lengths. Our framework models the forward channel corruption as a series of diffusion steps that can be reversed iteratively. Three contributions are made: (i) a diffusion process suitable for the decoding setting is introduced, (ii) the neural diffusion decoder is conditioned on the number of parity errors, which indicates the level of corruption at a given step, (iii) a line search procedure based on the code's syndrome obtains the optimal reverse diffusion step size. The proposed approach demonstrates the power of diffusion models for ECC and is able to achieve state-of-the-art accuracy, outperforming the other neural decoders by sizable margins, even for a single reverse diffusion step",

    "abstract": "To alleviate the high annotation cost in LiDAR-based 3D object detection, active learning is a promising solution that learns to select only a small portion of unlabeled data to annotate, without compromising model performance. Our empirical study, however, suggests that mainstream uncertainty-based and diversity-based active learning policies are not effective when applied in the 3D detection task, as they fail to balance the trade-off between point cloud informativeness and box-level annotation costs. To overcome this limitation, we jointly investigate three novel criteria in our framework CRB for point cloud acquisition - label conciseness, feature representativeness and geometric balance, which hierarchically filters out the point clouds of redundant 3D bounding box labels, latent features and geometric characteristics (e.g., point cloud density) from the unlabeled sample pool and greedily selects informative ones with fewer objects to annotate. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates that the proposed criteria aligns the marginal distributions of the selected subset and the prior distributions of the unseen test set, and minimizes the upper bound of the generalization error. To validate the effectiveness and applicability of CRB, we conduct extensive experiments on the two benchmark 3D object detection datasets of KITTI and Waymo and examine both one-stage (i.e., Second) and two-stage 3D detector (i.e., PV-RCNN). Experiments evidence that the proposed approach outperforms existing active learning strategies and achieves fully supervised performance requiring $1\\%$ and $8\\%$ annotations of bounding boxes and point clouds, respectively",

However, such elicited pre-trained knowledge in LLMs induces spurious correlations between goals and steps, which impair the model generalization to unseen tasks. In contrast, this paper proposes a neuro-symbolic procedural PLANner (PLAN) that elicits procedural planning knowledge from the LLMs with commonsense-infused prompting. To mitigate spurious goal-step correlations, we use symbolic program executors on the latent procedural representations to formalize prompts from commonsense knowledge bases as a causal intervention toward the Structural Causal Model.

Nonetheless, GFlowNets only learn from rewards of the terminal states, which can limit its applicability. Indeed, intermediate rewards play a critical role in learning, for example from intrinsic motivation to provide intermediate feedback even in particularly challenging sparse reward tasks. Inspired by this, we propose Generative Augmented Flow Networks (GAFlowNets), a novel learning framework to incorporate intermediate rewards into GFlowNets. We specify intermediate rewards by intrinsic motivation to tackle the exploration problem in sparse reward environments. GAFlowNets can leverage edge-based and state-based intrinsic rewards in a joint way to improve exploration. Based on extensive experiments on the GridWorld task, we demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of GAFlowNet in terms of convergence, performance, and diversity of solutions.

    "abstract": "Pre-training representations (a.k.a. foundation models) has recently become a prevalent learning paradigm, where one first pre-trains a representation using large-scale unlabeled data, and then learns simple predictors on top of the representation using small labeled data from the downstream tasks. There are two key desiderata for the representation: label efficiency (the ability to learn an accurate classifier on top of the representation with a small amount of labeled data) and universality (usefulness across a wide range of downstream tasks). In this paper, we focus on one of the most popular instantiations of this paradigm: contrastive learning with linear probing, i.e., learning a linear predictor on the representation pre-trained by contrastive learning. We show that there exists a trade-off between the two desiderata so that one may not be able to achieve both simultaneously. Specifically, we provide analysis using a theoretical data model and show that, while more diverse pre-training data result in more diverse features for different tasks (improving universality), it puts less emphasis on task-specific features, giving rise to larger sample complexity for down-stream supervised tasks, and thus worse prediction performance. Guided by this analysis, we propose a contrastive regularization method to improve the trade-off.

    "volume": "spotlight",
    "abstract": "The long runtime of high-fidelity partial differential equation (PDE) solvers makes them unsuitable for time-critical applications. We propose to accelerate PDE solvers using reduced-order modeling (ROM). Whereas prior ROM approaches reduce the dimensionality of discretized vector fields, our continuous reduced-order modeling (CROM) approach builds a low-dimensional embedding of the continuous vector fields themselves, not their discretization. We represent this reduced manifold using continuously differentiable neural fields, which may train on any and all available numerical solutions of the continuous system, even when they are obtained using diverse methods or discretizations. We validate our approach on an extensive range of PDEs with training data from voxel grids, meshes, and point clouds. Compared to prior discretization-dependent ROM methods, such as linear subspace proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) and nonlinear manifold neural-network-based autoencoders, CROM features higher accuracy, lower memory consumption, dynamically adaptive resolutions, and applicability to any discretization. For equal latent space dimension, CROM exhibits 79$\\times$ and 49$\\times$ better accuracy, and 39$\\times$ and 132$\\times$ smaller memory footprint, than POD and autoencoder methods, respectively. Experiments demonstrate 109$\\times$ and 89$\\times$ wall-clock speedups over unreduced models on CPUs and GPUs, respectively.

    "volume": "spotlight",
    "abstract": "We investigate how multimodal prompt engineering can use language as the intermediate representation to combine complementary knowledge from different pretrained (potentially multimodal) language models for a variety of tasks. This approach is both distinct from and complementary to the dominant paradigm of joint multimodal training. It also recalls a traditional systems-building view as in classical NLP pipelines, but with prompting large pretrained multimodal models. We refer to these as Socratic Models (SMs): a modular class of systems in which multiple pretrained models may be composed zero-shot via multimodal-informed prompting to capture new multimodal capabilities, without additional finetuning. We show that these systems provide competitive state-of-the-art performance for zero-shot image captioning and video-to-text retrieval, and also enable new applications such as (i) answering free-form questions about egocentric video, (ii) engaging in multimodal assistive dialogue with people (e.g., for cooking recipes), and (iii) robot perception and planning. We hope this work provides (a) results for stronger zero-shot baseline performance with analysis also highlighting their limitations, (b) new perspectives for building multimodal systems powered by large pretrained models, and (c) practical application advantages in certain regimes limited by data scarcity, training compute, or model access",

    "title": "GRACE-C: Generalized Rate Agnostic Causal Estimation via Constraints",
    "volume": "spotlight",
    "abstract": "Graphical structures estimated by causal learning algorithms from time series data can provide highly misleading causal information if the causal timescale of the generating process fails to match the measurement timescale of the data. Existing algorithms provide limited resources to respond to this challenge, and so researchers must either use models that they know are likely misleading, or else forego causal learning entirely. Existing methods face up-to-four distinct shortfalls, as they might a) require that the difference between causal and measurement timescales is known; b) only handle very small number of random variables when the timescale difference is unknown; c) only apply to pairs of variables (albeit with fewer assumptions about prior knowledge); or d) be unable to find a solution given statistical noise in the data. This paper aims to address these challenges. We present an approach that combines constraint programming with both theoretical insights into the problem structure and prior information about admissible causal interactions to achieve speed up of multiple orders of magnitude. The resulting system scales to significantly larger sets of random variables ($>100$) without knowledge of the timescale difference while maintaining theoretical guarantees. This method is also robust to edge misidentification and can use parametric connection strengths, while optionally finding the optimal among many possible solutions",

    "abstract": "Despite their widespread success in various domains, Transformer networks have yet to perform well across datasets in the domain of 3D atomistic graphs such as molecules even when 3D-related inductive biases like translational invariance and rotational equivariance are considered. In this paper, we demonstrate that Transformers can generalize well to 3D atomistic graphs and present Equiformer, a graph neural network leveraging the strength of Transformer architectures and incorporating SE(3)/E(3)-equivariant features based on irreducible representations (irreps). First, we propose a simple and effective architecture by only replacing original operations in Transformers with their equivariant counterparts and including tensor products. Using equivariant operations enables encoding equivariant information in channels of irreps features without complicating graph structures. With minimal modifications to Transformers, this architecture has already achieved strong empirical results. Second, we propose a novel attention mechanism called equivariant graph attention, which improves upon typical attention in Transformers through replacing dot product attention with multi-layer perceptron attention and including non-linear message passing. With these two innovations, Equiformer achieves competitive results to previous models on QM9, MD17 and OC20 datasets",

Unfortunately, the application of privacy enhancing technologies can worsen unfair tendencies in models. In particular, one of the most widely used techniques for private model training, differentially private stochastic gradient descent (DPSGD), frequently intensifies disparate impact on groups within data. In this work we study the fine-grained causes of unfairness in DPSGD and identify gradient misalignment due to inequitable gradient clipping as the most significant source.

TabPFN is fully entailed in the weights of our network, which accepts training and test samples as a set-valued input and yields predictions for the entire test set in a single forward pass. TabPFN is a Prior-Data Fitted Network (PFN) and is trained offline once, to approximate Bayesian inference on synthetic datasets drawn from our prior. This prior incorporates ideas from causal reasoning: It entails a large space of structural causal models with a preference for simple structures. On the $18$ datasets in the OpenML-CC18 suite that contain up to 1000 training data points, up to 100 purely numerical features without missing values, and up to 10 classes, we show that our method clearly outperforms boosted trees and performs on par with complex state-of-the-art AutoML systems with up to $230\\times$ speedup. This increases to a $5\\,700\\times$ speedup when using a GPU. We also validate these results on an additional 67 small numerical datasets from OpenML.

    "title": "Human Motion Diffusion Model",
    "volume": "spotlight",
    "abstract": "Natural and expressive human motion generation is the holy grail of computer animation. It is a challenging task, due to the diversity of possible motion, human perceptual sensitivity to it, and the difficulty of accurately describing it. Therefore, current generative solutions are either low-quality or limited in expressiveness. Diffusion models are promising candidates for the human motion domain since they have already shown remarkable generative capabilities in other domains, and their many-to-many nature. In this paper, we introduce Motion Diffusion Model (MDM), a carefully adapted classifier-free diffusion-based generative model for human motion data. MDM is transformer-based, combining insights from motion generation literature. A notable design-choice is that it predicts the sample itself rather than the noise in each step to facilitate the use of established geometric losses on the locations and velocities of the motion, such as the foot contact loss. As we demonstrate, MDM is a generic approach, enabling different modes of conditioning, and different generation tasks. We show that our model is trained with lightweight resources and yet achieves state-of-the-art results on leading benchmarks for text-to-motion, action-to-motion, and unconditioned motion generation",

    "volume": "spotlight",
    "abstract": "We devise deep nearest centroids (DNC), a conceptually elegant yet surprisingly effective network for large-scale visual recognition, by revisiting Nearest Centroids, one of the most classic and simple classifiers. Current deep models learn the classifier in a fully parametric manner, ignoring the latent data structure and lacking simplicity and explainability. DNC instead conducts nonparametric, case-based reasoning; it utilizes sub-centroids of training samples to describe class distributions and clearly explains the classification as the proximity of test data and the class sub-centroids in the feature space. Due to the distance-based nature, the network output dimensionality is flexible, and all the learnable parameters are only for data embedding. That means all the knowledge learnt for ImageNet classification can be completely transferred for pixel recognition learning, under the ‘pre-training and fine-tuning' paradigm. Apart from its nested simplicity and intuitive decision-making mechanism, DNC can even possess ad-hoc explainability when the sub-centroids are selected as actual training images that humans can view and inspect. Compared with parametric counterparts, DNC performs better on image classification (CIFAR-10, ImageNet) and greatly boots pixel recognition (ADE20K, Cityscapes), with improved transparency and fewer learnable parameters, using various network architectures (ResNet, Swin) and segmentation models (FCN, DeepLabV3, Swin).

This is achieved by embedding spatial observations independently of their discretization via Implicit Neural Representations in a small latent space temporally driven by a learned ODE. This separate and flexible treatment of time and space makes DINo the first data-driven model to combine the following advantages. It extrapolates at arbitrary spatial and temporal locations; it can learn from sparse irregular grids or manifolds; at test time, it generalizes to new grids or resolutions.

    "abstract": "We consider the problem of training a deep neural network on a given classification task, e.g., ImageNet-1K (IN1K), so that it excels at both the training task as well as at other (future) transfer tasks. These two seemingly contradictory properties impose a trade-off between improving the model's generalization and maintaining its performance on the original task. Models trained with self-supervised learning tend to generalize better than their supervised counterparts for transfer learning; yet, they still lag behind supervised models on IN1K. In this paper, we propose a supervised learning setup that leverages the best of both worlds. We extensively analyze supervised training using multi-scale crops for data augmentation and an expendable projector head, and reveal that the design of the projector allows us to control the trade-off between performance on the training task and transferability. We further replace the last layer of class weights with class prototypes computed on the fly using a memory bank and derive two models: t-ReX that achieves a new state of the art for transfer learning and outperforms top methods such as DINO and PAWS on IN1K, and t-ReX* that matches the highly optimized RSB-A1 model on IN1K while performing better on transfer tasks.

    "abstract": "Inverse graphics aims to recover 3D models from 2D observations. Utilizing differentiable rendering, recent 3D-aware generative models have shown impressive results of rigid object generation using 2D images. However, it remains challenging to generate articulated objects, like human bodies, due to their complexity and diversity in poses and appearances. In this work, we propose, EVA3D, an unconditional 3D human generative model learned from 2D image collections only. EVA3D can sample 3D humans with detailed geometry and render high-quality images (up to 512x256) without bells and whistles (e.g. super resolution). At the core of EVA3D is a compositional human NeRF representation, which divides the human body into local parts. Each part is represented by an individual volume. This compositional representation enables 1) inherent human priors, 2) adaptive allocation of network parameters, 3) efficient training and rendering. Moreover, to accommodate for the characteristics of sparse 2D human image collections (e.g. imbalanced pose distribution), we propose a pose-guided sampling strategy for better GAN learning. Extensive experiments validate that EVA3D achieves state-of-the-art 3D human generation performance regarding both geometry and texture quality. Notably, EVA3D demonstrates great potential and scalability to \"inverse-graphics\" diverse human bodies with a clean framework",

    "title": "Voxurf: Voxel-based Efficient and Accurate Neural Surface Reconstruction",

    "abstract": "Neural surface reconstruction aims to reconstruct accurate 3D surfaces based on multi-view images. Previous methods based on neural volume rendering mostly train a fully implicit model with MLPs, which typically require hours of training for a single scene. Recent efforts explore the explicit volumetric representation to accelerate the optimization via memorizing significant information with learnable voxel grids. However, existing voxel-based methods often struggle in reconstructing fine-grained geometry, even when combined with an SDF-based volume rendering scheme. We reveal that this is because 1) the voxel grids tend to break the color-geometry dependency that facilitates fine-geometry learning, and 2) the under-constrained voxel grids lack spatial coherence and are vulnerable to local minima. In this work, we present Voxurf, a voxel-based surface reconstruction approach that is both efficient and accurate. Voxurf addresses the aforementioned issues via several key designs, including 1) a two-stage training procedure that attains a coherent coarse shape and recovers fine details successively, 2) a dual color network that maintains color-geometry dependency, and 3) a hierarchical geometry feature to encourage information propagation across voxels. Extensive experiments show that Voxurf achieves high efficiency and high quality at the same time. On the DTU benchmark, Voxurf achieves higher reconstruction quality with a 20x training speedup compared to previous fully implicit methods.

    "abstract": "Intelligent systems deployed in the real world suffer from catastrophic forgetting when exposed to a sequence of tasks. Humans, on the other hand, acquire, consolidate, and transfer knowledge between tasks that rarely interfere with the consolidated knowledge. Accompanied by self-regulated neurogenesis, continual learning in the brain is governed by the rich set of neurophysiological processes that harbor different types of knowledge which are then integrated by the conscious processing. Thus, inspired by Global Workspace Theory of conscious information access in the brain, we propose TAMiL, a continual learning method that entails task-attention modules to capture task-specific information from the common representation space. We employ simple, undercomplete autoencoders to create a communication bottleneck between the common representation space and the global workspace, allowing only the task-relevant information to the global workspace, thereby greatly reducing task interference. Experimental results show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art rehearsal-based and dynamic sparse approaches and bridges the gap between fixed capacity and parameter isolation approaches while being scalable. We also show that our method effectively mitigates catastrophic forgetting while being well-calibrated with reduced task-recency bias",

We present FairGBM, a dual ascent learning framework for training GBDT under fairness constraints, with little to no impact on predictive performance when compared to unconstrained GBDT. Since observational fairness metrics are non-differentiable, we propose smooth convex error rate proxies for common fairness criteria, enabling gradient-based optimization using a ``proxy-Lagrangian'' formulation.

Conventional wisdom suggests that, in this setting, models are trained using an approach called experience replay, where the risk is computed both with respect to current stream observations and to a small subset of past observations. In this work, we explain both theoretically and empirically how experience replay biases the outputs of the model towards recent stream observations. Moreover, we propose a simple approach to mitigate this bias online, by changing how the output layer of the model is optimized. We show that our approach improves significantly the learning performance of experience-replay approaches over different datasets.

    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "Semi-supervised learning (SSL) provides an effective means of leveraging unlabelled data to improve a model's performance. Even though the domain has received a considerable amount of attention in the past years, most methods present the common drawback of lacking theoretical guarantees. Our starting point is to notice that the estimate of the risk that most discriminative SSL methods minimise is biased, even asymptotically. This bias impedes the use of standard statistical learning theory and can hurt empirical performance. We propose a simple way of removing the bias. Our debiasing approach is straightforward to implement and applicable to most deep SSL methods. We provide simple theoretical guarantees on the trustworthiness of these modified methods, without having to rely on the strong assumptions on the data distribution that SSL theory usually requires. In particular, we provide generalisation error bounds for the proposed methods. We evaluate debiased versions of different existing SSL methods, such as the Pseudo-label method and Fixmatch, and show that debiasing can compete with classic deep SSL techniques in various settings by providing better calibrated models. Additionally, we provide a theoretical explanation of the intuition of the popular SSL methods. An implementation of a debiased version of Fixmatch is available at https://github.com/HugoSchmutz/DeFixmatch",

    "abstract": "The transferability of adversarial examples across deep neural networks (DNNs) is the crux of many black-box attacks. Many prior efforts have been devoted to improving the transferability via increasing the diversity in inputs of some substitute models. In this paper, by contrast, we opt for the diversity in substitute models and advocate to attack a Bayesian model for achieving desirable transferability. Deriving from the Bayesian formulation, we develop a principled strategy for possible finetuning, which can be combined with many off-the-shelf Gaussian posterior approximations over DNN parameters. Extensive experiments have been conducted to verify the effectiveness of our method, on common benchmark datasets, and the results demonstrate that our method outperforms recent state-of-the-arts by large margins (roughly 19% absolute increase in average attack success rate on ImageNet), and, by combining with these recent methods, further performance gain can be obtained.

    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "More and more evidence has shown that strengthening layer interactions can enhance the representation power of a deep neural network, while self-attention excels at learning interdependencies by retrieving query-activated information. Motivated by this, we devise a cross-layer attention mechanism, called multi-head recurrent layer attention (MRLA), that sends a query representation of the current layer to all previous layers to retrieve query-related information from different levels of receptive fields. A light-weighted version of MRLA is also proposed to reduce the quadratic computation cost. The proposed layer attention mechanism can enrich the representation power of many state-of-the-art vision networks, including CNNs and vision transformers. Its effectiveness has been extensively evaluated in image classification, object detection and instance segmentation tasks, where improvements can be consistently observed. For example, our MRLA can improve 1.6% Top-1 accuracy on ResNet-50, while only introducing 0.16M parameters and 0.07B FLOPs. Surprisingly, it can boost the performances by a large margin of 3-4% box AP and mask AP in dense prediction tasks. Our code is available at https://github.com/joyfang1106/MRLA",

Since transformers are parameter-heavy, cannot benefit from history longer than a fixed window size, and are not computed using recurrence, we set out to investigate the suitability of the S4 family of models, which are based on state-space layers and have been shown to outperform transformers, especially in modeling long-range dependencies. In this work, we present two main algorithms: (i) an off-policy training procedure that works with trajectories, while still maintaining the training efficiency of the S4 model. (ii) An on-policy training procedure that is trained in a recurrent manner, benefits from long-range dependencies, and is based on a novel stable actor-critic mechanism. Our results indicate that our method outperforms multiple variants of decision transformers, as well as the other baseline methods on most tasks, while reducing the latency, number of parameters, and training time by several orders of magnitude, making our approach more suitable for real-world RL",

    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "A powerful framework for studying graphs is to consider them as geometric graphs: nodes are randomly sampled from an underlying metric space, and any pair of nodes is connected if their distance is less than a specified neighborhood radius. Currently, the literature mostly focuses on uniform sampling and constant neighborhood radius. However, real-world graphs are likely to be better represented by a model in which the sampling density and the neighborhood radius can both vary over the latent space. For instance, in a social network communities can be modeled as densely sampled areas, and hubs as nodes with larger neighborhood radius. In this work, we first perform a rigorous mathematical analysis of this (more general) class of models, including derivations of the resulting graph shift operators. The key insight is that graph shift operators should be corrected in order to avoid potential distortions introduced by the non-uniform sampling. Then, we develop methods to estimate the unknown sampling density in a self-supervised fashion. Finally, we present exemplary applications in which the learnt density is used to 1) correct the graph shift operator and improve performance on a variety of tasks, 2) improve pooling, and 3) extract knowledge from networks. Our experimental findings support our theory and provide strong evidence for our model",

    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "Under stringent model type and variable distribution assumptions, score-based causal discovery methods learn the directed acyclic graph (DAG) from observational data by evaluating candidate graphs over an averaged score function. Despite the great success in low-dimensional linear systems, it has been observed that these approaches overly exploits easier-to-fit samples, thus inevitably learning spurious edges. Worse still, the common homogeneity assumption of most causal discovery methods can be easily violated due to the widespread existence of heterogeneous data in the real world, resulting in performance vulnerability when noise distributions vary. We propose a simple yet effective model-agnostic framework to boost causal discovery performance by dynamically learning the adaptive weights for the Reweighted Score function, ReScore for short, where the learned weights tailors quantitatively to the important degree of each samples. Intuitively, we leverage the bilevel optimization scheme to alternatively train a standard DAG learner first, then upweight the samples that the DAG learner fails to fit well and downweight the samples that the DAG learner easily extracts the causation information from. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets are carried out to validate the effectiveness of ReScore. We observe consistent and significant boosts in structure learning performance. We further visualize that ReScore concurrently mitigates the influence of spurious edges and generalizes to heterogeneous data. Finally, we perform theoretical analysis to guarantee the structure identifiability and the weight adaptive properties of ReScore. Our codes are available at https://github.com/anzhang314/ReScore",

    "abstract": "Large pre-trained language models have helped to achieve state of the art on a variety of NLP tasks, nevertheless, they still suffer from forgetting when incrementally learning a series of sequential tasks. To alleviate this problem, recent works propose several models enhanced by sparse experience replay and local adaption, which yield satisfactory performance. However, in this paper we find that pre-trained language models like BERT have a potential ability to learn sequentially, even without any sparse memory replay. To verify the ability of BERT to maintain old knowledge, we adopt and re-finetune single-layer probe networks with the parameters of BERT fixed. We investigate the models on two typical kinds of NLP tasks, text classification and extractive question answering. And our experiments reveal that BERT can actually generate high quality representations for previous tasks in a long term, under extremely sparse replay or even no replay. We further introduce a series of methods to interpret the mechanism of forgetting and how memory rehearsal plays a significant role in task incremental learning, which bridges the gap between our new discovery and previous studies about catastrophic forgetting. Additionally, we provide both quantified and visualized results demonstrating that the representation space of BERT is always topologically organised, which guarantees its performance",

    "abstract": "Offline reinforcement learning (RL) is a challenging setting where existing off-policy actor-critic methods perform poorly due to overestimating of out-of-distribution state-action pairs. Thus, various additional augmentations are proposed to keep the learned policy close to the offline dataset (or the behavior policy). In this work, starting from the analysis of offline monotonic policy improvement, we reach a surprising conclusion that online on-policy algorithms are naturally able to solve offline RL. Specifically, the inherent conservatism of these on-policy algorithms is exactly what the offline RL method needs to overcome the overestimation. Based on this, we propose Behavior Proximal Policy Optimization (BPPO), which solves offline RL without any extra constraint or regularization introduced compared to PPO. Extensive experiments on the D4RL benchmark empirically show this extremely succinct method outperforms state-of-the-art offline RL algorithms.

    "abstract": "To afford flexible behaviour, the brain must build internal representations that mirror the structure of variables in the external world. For example, 2D space obeys rules: the same set of actions combine in the same way everywhere (step north, then south, and you won't have moved, wherever you start). We suggest the brain must represent this consistent meaning of actions across space, as it allows you to find new short-cuts and navigate in unfamiliar settings. We term this representation an `actionable representation'. We formulate actionable representations using group and representation theory, and show that, when combined with biological and functional constraints - non-negative firing, bounded neural activity, and precise coding - multiple modules of hexagonal grid cells are the optimal representation of 2D space. We support this claim with intuition, analytic justification, and simulations. Our analytic results normatively explain a set of surprising grid cell phenomena, and make testable predictions for future experiments. Lastly, we highlight the generality of our approach beyond just understanding 2D space. Our work characterises a new principle for understanding and designing flexible internal representations: they should be actionable, allowing animals and machines to predict the consequences of their actions, rather than just encode",

    "title": "Mole-BERT: Rethinking Pre-training Graph Neural Networks for Molecules",
    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "Recent years have witnessed the prosperity of pre-training graph neural networks (GNNs) for molecules. Typically, atom types as node attributes are randomly masked, and GNNs are then trained to predict masked types as in AttrMask \\citep{hu2020strategies}, following the Masked Language Modeling (MLM) task of BERT~\\citep{devlin2019bert}. However, unlike MLM with a large vocabulary, the AttrMask pre-training does not learn informative molecular representations due to small and unbalanced atom `vocabulary'. To amend this problem, we propose a variant of VQ-VAE~\\citep{van2017neural} as a context-aware tokenizer to encode atom attributes into chemically meaningful discrete codes. This can enlarge the atom vocabulary size and mitigate the quantitative divergence between dominant (e.g., carbons) and rare atoms (e.g., phosphorus). With the enlarged atom `vocabulary', we propose a novel node-level pre-training task, dubbed Masked Atoms Modeling (\\textbf{MAM}), to mask some discrete codes randomly and then pre-train GNNs to predict them.

We show that by ignoring the underlying geometry of the data and applying standard vector space regularization techniques, autoencoder performance can be severely degraded, or worse, training can fail to converge. Assuming that both the data space and latent space can be modeled as Riemannian manifolds, we show how to construct regularization terms in a coordinate-invariant way, and develop geometric generalizations of the denoising autoencoder and reconstruction contractive autoencoder such that the essential properties that enable the estimation of the derivative of the log-probability density are preserved. Drawing upon various non-Euclidean data sets, we show that our geometric autoencoder regularization techniques can have important performance advantages over vector-spaced methods while avoiding other breakdowns that can result from failing to account for the underlying geometry",

    "abstract": "In recent years, contrastive learning achieves impressive results on self-supervised visual representation learning, but there still lacks a rigorous understanding of its learning dynamics. In this paper, we show that if we cast a contrastive objective equivalently into the feature space, then its learning dynamics admits an interpretable form. Specifically, we show that its gradient descent corresponds to a specific message passing scheme on the corresponding augmentation graph. Based on this perspective, we theoretically characterize how contrastive learning gradually learns discriminative features with the alignment update and the uniformity update. Meanwhile, this perspective also establishes an intriguing connection between contrastive learning and Message Passing Graph Neural Networks (MP-GNNs). This connection not only provides a unified understanding of many techniques independently developed in each community, but also enables us to borrow techniques from MP-GNNs to design new contrastive learning variants, such as graph attention, graph rewiring, jumpy knowledge techniques, etc. We believe that our message passing perspective not only provides a new theoretical understanding of contrastive learning dynamics, but also bridges the two seemingly independent areas together, which could inspire more interleaving studies to benefit from each other.

    "abstract": "Zeroth-order (ZO) optimization, in which the derivative is unavailable, has recently succeeded in many important machine learning applications. Existing algorithms rely on finite difference (FD) methods for derivative estimation and gradient descent (GD)-based approaches for optimization. However, these algorithms suffer from query inefficiency because many additional function queries are required for derivative estimation in their every GD update, which typically hinders their deployment in real-world applications where every function query is expensive. To this end, we propose a trajectory-informed derivative estimation method which only employs the optimization trajectory (i.e., the history of function queries during optimization) and hence can eliminate the need for additional function queries to estimate a derivative. Moreover, based on our derivative estimation, we propose the technique of dynamic virtual updates, which allows us to reliably perform multiple steps of GD updates without reapplying derivative estimation. Based on these two contributions, we introduce the zeroth-order optimization with trajectory-informed derivative estimation (ZoRD) algorithm for query-efficient ZO optimization. We theoretically demonstrate that our trajectory-informed derivative estimation and our ZoRD algorithm improve over existing approaches, which is then supported by our real-world experiments such as black-box adversarial attack, non-differentiable metric optimization, and derivative-free reinforcement learning",

    "abstract": "This paper investigates a missing feature imputation problem for graph learning tasks. Several methods have previously addressed learning tasks on graphs with missing features. However, in cases of high rates of missing features, they were unable to avoid significant performance degradation. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a novel concept of channel-wise confidence in a node feature, which is assigned to each imputed channel feature of a node for reflecting the certainty of the imputation. We then design pseudo-confidence using the channel-wise shortest path distance between a missing-feature node and its nearest known-feature node to replace unavailable true confidence in an actual learning process. Based on the pseudo-confidence, we propose a novel feature imputation scheme that performs channel-wise inter-node diffusion and node-wise inter-channel propagation. The scheme can endure even at an exceedingly high missing rate (e.g., 99.5\\%) and it achieves state-of-the-art accuracy for both semi-supervised node classification and link prediction on various datasets containing a high rate of missing features.

Pre-training the model on large-scale datasets and fine-tuning it on specific tasks has become a well-established paradigm in human-centric perception. Recently, self-supervised learning methods have re-investigated contrastive learning to achieve superior performance on various downstream tasks. When handling human-centric perception, there still remains untapped potential since 3D human structure information is neglected during the task-agnostic pre-training. In this paper, we propose the Lifting Contrastive Learning (LiftedCL) to obtain 3D-aware human-centric representations which absorb 3D human structure information. In particular, to induce the learning process, a set of 3D skeletons is randomly sampled by resorting to 3D human kinematic prior. With this set of generic 3D samples, 3D human structure information can be learned into 3D-aware representations through adversarial learning. Empirical results demonstrate that LiftedCL outperforms state-of-the-art self-supervised methods on four human-centric downstream tasks, including 2D and 3D human pose estimation (0.4% mAP and 1.8 mm MPJPE improvement on COCO 2D pose estimation and Human3.6M 3D pose estimation), human shape recovery and human parsing",

This can be informative as often the individual privacy losses are considerably smaller than those indicated by the DP bounds that are based on considering worst-case bounds at each data access. In order to account for the individual losses in a principled manner, we need a privacy accountant for adaptive compositions of mechanisms, where the loss incurred at a given data access is allowed to be smaller than the worst-case loss. This kind of analysis has been carried out for the Rényi differential privacy by Feldman and Zrnic (2021), however not yet for the so-called optimal privacy accountants. We make first steps in this direction by providing a careful analysis using the Gaussian differential privacy which gives optimal bounds for the Gaussian mechanism, one of the most versatile DP mechanisms. This approach is based on determining a certain supermartingale for the hockey-stick divergence and on extending the Rényi divergence-based fully adaptive composition results by Feldman and Zrnic (2021). We also consider measuring the individual $(\\varepsilon,\\delta)$-privacy losses using the so-called privacy loss distributions. Using the Blackwell theorem, we can then use the results of Feldman and Zrnic (2021) to construct an approximative individual $(\\varepsilon,\\delta)$-accountant.

    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "Quality Diversity (QD) has emerged as a powerful alternative optimization paradigm that aims at generating large and diverse collections of solutions, notably with its flagship algorithm MAP-ELITES (ME) which evolves solutions through mutations and crossovers. While very effective for some unstructured problems, early ME implementations relied exclusively on random search to evolve the population of solutions, rendering them notoriously sample-inefficient for high-dimensional problems, such as when evolving neural networks. Follow-up works considered exploiting gradient information to guide the search in order to address these shortcomings through techniques borrowed from either Black-Box Optimization (BBO) or Reinforcement Learning (RL). While mixing RL techniques with ME unlocked state-of-the-art performance for robotics control problems that require a good amount of exploration, it also plagued these ME variants with limitations common among RL algorithms that ME was free of, such as hyperparameter sensitivity, high stochasticity as well as training instability, including when the population size increases as some components are shared across the population in recent approaches. Furthermore, existing approaches mixing ME with RL tend to be tied to a specific RL algorithm, which effectively prevents their use on problems where the corresponding RL algorithm fails. To address these shortcomings, we introduce a flexible framework that allows the use of any RL algorithm and alleviates the aforementioned limitations by evolving populations of agents (whose definition include hyperparameters and all learnable parameters) instead of just policies. We demonstrate the benefits brought about by our framework through extensive numerical experiments on a number of robotics control problems, some of which with deceptive rewards, taken from the QD-RL literature.

In this paper, we propose a new approach capable of protein sequence and structure co-design, which iteratively translates both protein sequence and structure into the desired state from random initialization, based on context features given a priori. Our model consists of a trigonometry-aware encoder that reasons geometrical constraints and interactions from context features, and a roto-translation equivariant decoder that translates protein sequence and structure interdependently. Notably, all protein amino acids are updated in one shot in each translation step, which significantly accelerates the inference process. Experimental results across multiple tasks show that our model outperforms previous state-of-the-art baselines by a large margin, and is able to design proteins of high fidelity as regards both sequence and structure, with running time orders of magnitude less than sampling-based methods",

We advance a multiscale learning method in which each weight in a neural network is decomposed as a sum of subweights with different learning and decay rates. Thus knowledge becomes distributed across different timescales, enabling rapid adaptation to task changes while avoiding catastrophic interference. First, we prove previous models that learn at multiple timescales, but with complex coupling between timescales, are equivalent to multiscale learning via a reparameterization that eliminates this coupling. The same analysis yields a new characterization of momentum learning, as a fast weight with a negative learning rate. Second, we derive a model of Bayesian inference over $1/f$ noise, a common temporal pattern in many online learning domains that involves long-range (power law) autocorrelations. The generative side of the model expresses $1/f$ noise as a sum of diffusion processes at different timescales, and the inferential side tracks these latent processes using a Kalman filter. We then derive a variational approximation to the Bayesian model and show how it is an extension of the multiscale learner. The result is an optimizer that can be used as a drop-in replacement in an arbitrary neural network architecture. Third, we evaluate the ability of these methods to handle nonstationarity by testing them in online prediction tasks characterized by $1/f$ noise in the latent parameters. We find that the Bayesian model significantly outperforms online stochastic gradient descent and two batch heuristics that rely preferentially or exclusively on more recent data. Moreover, the variational approximation performs nearly as well as the full Bayesian model, and with memory requirements that are linear in the size of the network",

We propose a new primal–dual algorithm, in which the dual update is randomized; equivalently, the proximity operator of one of the function in the problem is replaced by a stochastic oracle. For instance, some randomly chosen dual variables, instead of all, are updated at each iteration. Or, the proximity operator of a function is called with some small probability only. A nonsmooth variance-reduction technique is implemented so that the algorithm finds an exact minimizer of the general problem involving smooth and nonsmooth functions, possibly composed with linear operators. We derive linear convergence results in presence of strong convexity; these results are new even in the deterministic case, when our algorithms reverts to the recently proposed Primal–Dual Davis–Yin algorithm. Some randomized algorithms of the literature are also recovered as particular cases (e.g., Point-SAGA). But our randomization technique is general and encompasses many unbiased mechanisms beyond sampling and probabilistic updates, including compression. Since the convergence speed depends on the slowest among the primal and dual contraction mechanisms, the iteration complexity might remain the same when randomness is used. On the other hand, the computation complexity can be significantly reduced. Overall, randomness helps getting faster algorithms.

A limitation of QR is that it is only defined for scalar target variables, due to the formulation of its objective function, and since the notion of quantiles has no standard definition for multivariate distributions. Recently, vector quantile regression (VQR) was proposed as an extension of QR for vector-valued target variables, thanks to a meaningful generalization of the notion of quantiles to multivariate distributions via optimal transport. Despite its elegance, VQR is arguably not applicable in practice due to several limitations: (i) it assumes a linear model for the quantiles of the target $\\rvec{Y}$ given the features $\\rvec{X}$; (ii) its exact formulation is intractable even for modestly-sized problems in terms of target dimensions, number of regressed quantile levels, or number of features, and its relaxed dual formulation may violate the monotonicity of the estimated quantiles; (iii) no fast or scalable solvers for VQR currently exist. In this work we fully address these limitations, namely: (i) We extend VQR to the non-linear case, showing substantial improvement over linear VQR; (ii) We propose {vector monotone rearrangement}, a method which ensures the quantile functions estimated by VQR are monotone functions; (iii) We provide fast, GPU-accelerated solvers for linear and nonlinear VQR which maintain a fixed memory footprint, and demonstrate that they scale to millions of samples and thousands of quantile levels; (iv) We release an optimized python package of our solvers as to widespread the use of VQR in real-world applications",

MCQA tasks have traditionally been presented to LLMs like cloze tasks. An LLM is conditioned on a question (without the associated answer options) and its chosen option is the one assigned the highest probability after normalization (for length, etc.). A more natural prompting approach is to present the question and answer options to the LLM jointly and have it output the symbol (e.g., \"A\") associated with its chosen answer option. This approach allows the model to explicitly compare answer options, reduces computational costs, and mitigates the effects of tokenization scheme and answer option representations on answer selection. For the natural approach to be effective, the LLM it is used with must be able to associate answer options with the symbols that represent them. The LLM needs what we term multiple choice symbol binding (MCSB) ability. This ability varies greatly by model. We show that a model with high MCSB ability performs much better with the natural approach than with the traditional approach across 20 diverse datasets and largely closes the gap with the SOTA, suggesting that the MCQA ability of LLMs has been previously underestimated",
