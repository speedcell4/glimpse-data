    "volume": "oral",
    "abstract": "This paper novelly breaks down with ignorable loss an RNN layer into a sequence of simple RNNs, each of which can be further rewritten into a lightweight positional encoding matrix of a self-attention, named the Recurrence Encoding Matrix (REM). Thus, recurrent dynamics introduced by the RNN layer can be encapsulated into the positional encodings of a multihead self-attention, and this makes it possible to seamlessly incorporate these recurrent dynamics into a Transformer, leading to a new module, Self-Attention with Recurrence (RSA). The proposed module can leverage the recurrent inductive bias of REMs to achieve a better sample efficiency than its corresponding baseline Transformer, while the self-attention is used to model the remaining non-recurrent signals. The relative proportions of these two components are controlled by a data-driven gated mechanism, and the effectiveness of RSA modules are demonstrated by four sequential learning tasks",

    "abstract": "Content creators compete for user attention. Their reach crucially depends on algorithmic choices made by developers on online platforms. To maximize exposure, many creators adapt strategically, as evidenced by examples like the sprawling search engine optimization industry. This begets competition for the finite user attention pool. We formalize these dynamics in what we call an exposure game, a model of incentives induced by modern algorithms including factorization and (deep) two-tower architectures. We prove that seemingly innocuous algorithmic choices—e.g., non-negative vs. unconstrained factorization—significantly affect the existence and character of (Nash) equilibria in exposure games. We proffer use of creator behavior models like ours for an (ex-ante) pre-deployment audit. Such an audit can identify misalignment between desirable and incentivized content, and thus complement post-hoc measures like content filtering and moderation. To this end, we propose tools for numerically finding equilibria in exposure games, and illustrate results of an audit on the MovieLens and LastFM datasets. Among else, we find that the strategically produced content exhibits strong dependence between algorithmic exploration and content diversity, and between model expressivity and bias towards gender-based user and creator groups",

    "abstract": "While neural architecture search (NAS) is an intensely-researched area, approaches typically still suffer from either (i) high computational costs or (ii) lack of robustness across datasets and experiments. Furthermore, most methods start searching for an optimal architecture from scratch, ignoring prior knowledge. This is in contrast to the manual design process by researchers and engineers that leverage previous deep learning experiences by, e.g., transferring architectures from previously solved, related problems. We propose to adopt this human design strategy and introduce a novel surrogate for NAS, that is meta-learned across prior architecture evaluations across different datasets. We utilizes Bayesian Optimization (BO) with deep-kernel Gaussian Processes, graph neural networks for the architecture embeddings and a transformer-based set encoder of datasets. As a result, our method consistently achieves state-of-the-art results on six computer vision datasets, while being as fast as one-shot NAS methods",

    "title": "Scaling Up Probabilistic Circuits by Latent Variable Distillation",
    "volume": "oral",
    "abstract": "Probabilistic Circuits (PCs) are a unified framework for tractable probabilistic models that support efficient computation of various probabilistic queries (e.g., marginal probabilities). One key challenge is to scale PCs to model large and high-dimensional real-world datasets: we observe that as the number of parameters in PCs increases, their performance immediately plateaus. This phenomenon suggests that the existing optimizers fail to exploit the full expressive power of large PCs. We propose to overcome such bottleneck by latent variable distillation: we leverage the less tractable but more expressive deep generative models to provide extra supervision over the latent variables of PCs. Specifically, we extract information from Transformer-based generative models to assign values to latent variables of PCs, providing guidance to PC optimizers. Experiments on both image and language modeling benchmarks (e.g., ImageNet and WikiText-2) show that latent variable distillation substantially boosts the performance of large PCs compared to their counterparts without latent variable distillation. In particular, on the image modeling benchmarks, PCs achieve competitive performance against some of the widely-used deep generative models, including variational autoencoders and flow-based models, opening up new avenues for tractable generative modeling.

    "abstract": "The success of deep learning is due in large part to our ability to solve certain massive non-convex optimization problems with relative ease. Though non-convex optimization is NP-hard, simple algorithms -- often variants of stochastic gradient descent -- exhibit surprising effectiveness in fitting large neural networks in practice. We argue that neural network loss landscapes often contain (nearly) a single basin after accounting for all possible permutation symmetries of hidden units a la Entezari et al. 2021. We introduce three algorithms to permute the units of one model to bring them into alignment with a reference model in order to merge the two models in weight space. This transformation produces a functionally equivalent set of weights that lie in an approximately convex basin near the reference model. Experimentally, we demonstrate the single basin phenomenon across a variety of model architectures and datasets, including the first (to our knowledge) demonstration of zero-barrier linear mode connectivity between independently trained ResNet models on CIFAR-10. Additionally, we identify intriguing phenomena relating model width and training time to mode connectivity. Finally, we discuss shortcomings of the linear mode connectivity hypothesis, including a counterexample to the single basin theory",

While such conditions might seem irrelevant to online reinforcement learning at first glance, we establish a new connection by showing---somewhat surprisingly---that the mere existence of a data distribution with good coverage can enable sample-efficient online RL. Concretely, we show that coverability---that is, existence of a data distribution that satisfies a ubiquitous coverage condition called concentrability---can be viewed as a structural property of the underlying MDP, and can be exploited by standard algorithms for sample-efficient exploration, even when the agent does not know said distribution. We complement this result by proving that several weaker notions of coverage, despite being sufficient for offline RL, are insufficient for online RL. We also show that existing complexity measures for online RL, including Bellman rank and Bellman-Eluder dimension, fail to optimally capture coverability, and propose a new complexity measure, the self-normalized coefficient, to provide a unification",

    "volume": "oral",
    "abstract": "There is a fundamental limitation in the prediction performance that a machine learning model can achieve due to the inevitable uncertainty of the prediction target. In classification problems, this can be characterized by the Bayes error, which is the best achievable error with any classifier. The Bayes error can be used as a criterion to evaluate classifiers with state-of-the-art performance and can be used to detect test set overfitting. We propose a simple and direct Bayes error estimator, where we just take the mean of the labels that show \\emph{uncertainty} of the class assignments. Our flexible approach enables us to perform Bayes error estimation even for weakly supervised data. In contrast to others, our method is model-free and even instance-free. Moreover, it has no hyperparameters and gives a more accurate estimate of the Bayes error than several baselines empirically. Experiments using our method suggest that recently proposed deep networks such as the Vision Transformer may have reached, or is about to reach, the Bayes error for benchmark datasets. Finally, we discuss how we can study the inherent difficulty of the acceptance/rejection decision for scientific articles, by estimating the Bayes error of the ICLR papers from 2017 to 2023",

    "abstract": "The potential of offline reinforcement learning (RL) is that high-capacity models trained on large, heterogeneous datasets can lead to agents that generalize broadly, analogously to similar advances in vision and NLP. However, recent works argue that offline RL methods encounter unique challenges to scaling up model capacity. Drawing on the learnings from these works, we re-examine previous design choices and find that with appropriate choices: ResNets, cross-entropy based distributional backups, and feature normalization, offline Q-learning algorithms exhibit strong performance that scales with model capacity. Using multi-task Atari as a testbed for scaling and generalization, we train a single policy on 40 games with near-human performance using up-to 80 million parameter networks, finding that model performance scales favorably with capacity. In contrast to prior work, we extrapolate beyond dataset performance even when trained entirely on a large (400M transitions) but highly suboptimal dataset (51% human-level performance). Compared to return-conditioned supervised approaches, offline Q-learning scales similarly with model capacity and has better performance, especially when the dataset is suboptimal. Finally, we show that offline Q-learning with a diverse dataset is sufficient to learn powerful representations that facilitate rapid transfer to novel games and fast online learning on new variations of a training game, improving over existing state-of-the-art representation learning approaches",

They can construct new predictors from sequences of labeled examples $(x, f(x))$ presented in the input without further parameter updates. We investigate the hypothesis that transformer-based in-context learners implement standard learning algorithms implicitly, by encoding context-specific parametric models in their hidden representations, and updating these implicit models as new examples appear in the context. Using linear regression as a model problem, we offer three sources of evidence for this hypothesis. First, we prove by construction that transformers can implement learning algorithms for linear models based on gradient descent and closed-form computation of regression parameters. Second, we show that trained in-context learners closely match the predictors computed by gradient descent, ridge regression, and exact least-squares regression, transitioning between different predictors as transformer depth and dataset noise vary. Third, we present preliminary evidence that in-context learners share algorithmic features with these predictors: learners' late layers encode weight vectors and moment matrices. These results suggest that in-context learning is understandable in algorithmic terms, and that (at least in the linear case) learners may work by rediscovering standard estimation algorithms",

    "title": "When and Why Vision-Language Models Behave like Bags-Of-Words, and What to Do About It?",
    "volume": "oral",
    "abstract": "Despite the success of large vision and language models (VLMs) in many downstream applications, it is unclear how well they encode the compositional relationships between objects and attributes. Here, we create the Attribution, Relation, and Order (ARO) benchmark to systematically evaluate the ability of VLMs to understand different types of relationships, attributes, and order information. ARO consists of \\emph{Visual Genome Attribution}, to test the understanding of objects' properties; \\emph{Visual Genome Relation}, to test for relational understanding; and \\emph{COCO-Order \\& Flickr30k-Order}, to test for order sensitivity in VLMs. ARO is orders of magnitude larger than previous benchmarks of compositionality, with more than 50,000 test cases. We present the settings where state-of-the-art VLMs behave like bags-of-words---i.e. when they have poor relational understanding, can blunder when linking objects to their attributes, and demonstrate a severe lack of order sensitivity. VLMs are predominantly trained and evaluated on large scale datasets with rich compositional structure in the images and captions. Yet, training on these datasets has not been enough to address the lack of compositional understanding, and evaluating on these datasets has failed to surface this deficiency. To understand why these limitations emerge and are not represented in the standard tests, we zoom into the evaluation and training procedures. We demonstrate that it is possible to perform well on image-text retrieval over existing datasets without using the composition and order information. This further motivates the value of using ARO to benchmark VLMs. Given that contrastive pretraining optimizes for retrieval on large datasets with similar shortcuts, we hypothesize that this can explain why the models do not need to learn to represent compositional information. This finding suggests a natural solution: composition-aware hard negative mining. We show that a simple-to-implement modification of contrastive learning significantly improves the performance on tasks requiring understanding of order and compositionality",

    "abstract": "Offline reinforcement learning (RL) promises the ability to learn effective policies solely using existing, static datasets, without any costly online interaction. To do so, offline RL methods must handle distributional shift between the dataset and the learned policy. The most common approach is to learn conservative, or lower-bound, value functions, which underestimate the return of OOD actions. However, such methods exhibit one notable drawback: policies optimized on such value functions can only behave according to a fixed, possibly suboptimal, degree of conservatism. However, this can be alleviated if we instead are able to learn policies for varying degrees of conservatism at training time and devise a method to dynamically choose one of them during evaluation. To do so, in this work, we propose learning value functions that additionally condition on the degree of conservatism, which we dub confidence-conditioned value functions. We derive a new form of a Bellman backup that simultaneously learns Q-values for any degree of confidence with high probability. By conditioning on confidence, our value functions enable adaptive strategies during online evaluation by controlling for confidence level using the history of observations thus far. This approach can be implemented in practice by conditioning the Q-function from existing conservative algorithms on the confidence. We theoretically show that our learned value functions produce conservative estimates of the true value at any desired confidence. Finally, we empirically show that our algorithm outperforms existing conservative offline RL algorithms on multiple discrete control domains",

    "abstract": "Inferring reward functions from human behavior is at the center of value alignment – aligning AI objectives with what we, humans, actually want. But doing so relies on models of how humans behave given their objectives. After decades of research in cognitive science, neuroscience, and behavioral economics, obtaining accurate human models remains an open research topic. This begs the question: how accurate do these models need to be in order for the reward inference to be accurate? On the one hand, if small errors in the model can lead to catastrophic error in inference, the entire framework of reward learning seems ill-fated, as we will never have perfect models of human behavior. On the other hand, if as our models improve, we can have a guarantee that reward accuracy also improves, this would show the benefit of more work on the modeling side. We study this question both theoretically and empirically. We do show that it is unfortunately possible to construct small adversarial biases in behavior that lead to arbitrarily large errors in the inferred reward. However, and arguably more importantly, we are also able to identify reasonable assumptions under which the reward inference error can be bounded linearly in the error in the human model.

    "abstract": "While recent camera-only 3D detection methods leverage multiple timesteps, the limited history they use significantly hampers the extent to which temporal fusion can improve object perception. Observing that existing works' fusion of multi-frame images are instances of temporal stereo matching, we find that performance is hindered by the interplay between 1) the low granularity of matching resolution and 2) the sub-optimal multi-view setup produced by limited history usage. Our theoretical and empirical analysis demonstrates that the optimal temporal difference between views varies significantly for different pixels and depths, making it necessary to fuse many timesteps over long-term history. Building on our investigation, we propose to generate a cost volume from a long history of image observations, compensating for the coarse but efficient matching resolution with a more optimal multi-view matching setup. Further, we augment the per-frame monocular depth predictions used for long-term, coarse matching with short-term, fine-grained matching and find that long and short term temporal fusion are highly complementary. While maintaining high efficiency, our framework sets new state-of-the-art on nuScenes, achieving first place on the test set and outperforming previous best art by 5.2% mAP and 3.7% NDS on the validation set.

    "abstract": "Future- or return-conditioned supervised learning is an emerging paradigm for offline reinforcement learning (RL), in which the future outcome (i.e., return) associated with a sequence of actions in an offline dataset is used as input to a policy trained to imitate those same actions. While return-conditioning is at the heart of popular algorithms such as decision transformer (DT), these methods tend to perform poorly in highly stochastic environments, where an occasional high return associated with a sequence of actions may be due more to the randomness of the environment than to the actions themselves. Such situations can lead to a learned policy that is inconsistent with its conditioning inputs; i.e., using the policy – while conditioned on a specific desired return – to act in the environment can lead to a distribution of real returns that is wildly different than desired. In this work, we propose the dichotomy of control (DoC), a future-conditioned supervised learning framework that separates mechanisms within a policy's control (actions) from those outside of a policy's control (environment stochasticity). We achieve this by conditioning the policy on a latent variable representation of the future and designing a mutual information constraint that removes any future information from the latent variable that is only due to randomness of the environment. Theoretically, we show that DoC yields policies that are consistent with their conditioning inputs, ensuring that conditioning a learned policy on a desired high-return future outcome will correctly induce high-return behavior. Empirically, we show that DoC is able to achieve significantly better performance than DT on environments with highly stochastic rewards (e.g., Bandit) and transitions (e.g., FrozenLake)",

This framework provides an appealing trade-off between the efficiency of constraint-free neural inference and the prohibitive cost of exhaustive reasoning at inference time.

We further study popular methods and introduce variations of them, allowing us to relate this theoretical result to current practices and show the influence (or lack thereof) of design choices on downstream performance. Motivated by our equivalence result, we investigate the low performance of SimCLR and show how it can match VICReg's with careful hyperparameter tuning, improving significantly over known baselines.

Our theoretical and quantitative results suggest that the numerical gaps between contrastive and non-contrastive methods in certain regimes can be closed given better network design choices and hyperparameter tuning.

    "volume": "oral",
    "abstract": "Recent breakthroughs in text-to-image synthesis have been driven by diffusion models trained on billions of image-text pairs. Adapting this approach to 3D synthesis would require large-scale datasets of labeled 3D or multiview data and efficient architectures for denoising 3D data, neither of which currently exist. In this work, we circumvent these limitations by using a pretrained 2D text-to-image diffusion model to perform text-to-3D synthesis. We introduce a loss based on probability density distillation that enables the use of a 2D diffusion model as a prior for optimization of a parametric image generator. Using this loss in a DeepDream-like procedure, we optimize a randomly-initialized 3D model (a Neural Radiance Field, or NeRF) via gradient descent such that its 2D renderings from random angles achieve a low loss. The resulting 3D model of the given text can be viewed from any angle, relit by arbitrary illumination, or composited into any 3D environment. Our approach requires no 3D training data and no modifications to the image diffusion model, demonstrating the effectiveness of pretrained image diffusion models as priors",

    "title": "Universal Few-shot Learning of Dense Prediction Tasks with Visual Token Matching",
    "volume": "oral",
    "abstract": "Dense prediction tasks are a fundamental class of problems in computer vision. As supervised methods suffer from high pixel-wise labeling cost, a few-shot learning solution that can learn any dense task from a few labeled images is desired. Yet, current few-shot learning methods target a restricted set of tasks such as semantic segmentation, presumably due to challenges in designing a general and unified model that is able to flexibly and efficiently adapt to arbitrary tasks of unseen semantics. We propose Visual Token Matching (VTM), a universal few-shot learner for arbitrary dense prediction tasks. It employs non-parametric matching on patch-level embedded tokens of images and labels that encapsulates all tasks. Also, VTM flexibly adapts to any task with a tiny amount of task-specific parameters that modulate the matching algorithm. We implement VTM as a powerful hierarchical encoder-decoder architecture involving ViT backbones where token matching is performed at multiple feature hierarchies. We experiment VTM on a challenging variant of Taskonomy dataset and observe that it robustly few-shot learns various unseen dense prediction tasks. Surprisingly, it is competitive with fully supervised baselines using only 10 labeled examples of novel tasks ($0.004\\%$ of full supervision) and sometimes outperforms using $0.1\\%$ of full supervision.

    "abstract": "Many machine learning problems today have multiple objective functions. They appear either in learning with multiple criteria where learning has to make a trade-off between multiple performance metrics such as fairness, safety and accuracy; or, in multi-task learning where multiple tasks are optimized jointly, sharing inductive bias between them. This problems are often tackled by the multi-objective optimization framework. However, existing stochastic multi-objective gradient methods and its variants (e.g., MGDA, PCGrad, CAGrad, etc.) all adopt a biased noisy gradient direction, which leads to degraded empirical performance. To this end, we develop a stochastic multi-objective gradient correction (MoCo) method for multi-objective optimization. The unique feature of our method is that it can guarantee convergence without increasing the batch size even in the nonconvex setting. Simulations on multi-task supervised and reinforcement learning demonstrate the effectiveness of our method relative to the state-of-the-art methods",

In this paper, we explore the use of LLMs to generate both reasoning traces and task-specific actions in an interleaved manner, allowing for greater synergy between the two: reasoning traces help the model induce, track, and update action plans as well as handle exceptions, while actions allow it to interface with external sources, such as knowledge bases or environments, to gather additional information. We apply our approach, named ReAct, to a diverse set of language and decision making tasks and demonstrate its effectiveness over state-of-the-art baselines, as well as improved human interpretability and trustworthiness over methods without reasoning or acting components. Concretely, on question answering (HotpotQA) and fact verification (Fever), ReAct overcomes issues of hallucination and error propagation prevalent in chain-of-thought reasoning by interacting with a simple Wikipedia API, and generates human-like task-solving trajectories that are more interpretable than baselines without reasoning traces. On two interactive decision making benchmarks (ALFWorld and WebShop), ReAct outperforms imitation and reinforcement learning methods by an absolute success rate of 34% and 10% respectively, while being prompted with only one or two in-context examples",

We investigate whether these methods can directly address the problem of sequential decision-making. We view decision-making not through the lens of reinforcement learning (RL), but rather through conditional generative modeling. To our surprise, we find that our formulation leads to policies that can outperform existing offline RL approaches across standard benchmarks. By modeling a policy as a return-conditional generative model, we avoid the need for dynamic programming and subsequently eliminate many of the complexities that come with traditional offline RL. We further demonstrate the advantages of modeling policies as conditional generative models by considering two other conditioning variables: constraints and skills. Conditioning on a single constraint or skill during training leads to behaviors at test-time that can satisfy several constraints together or demonstrate a composition of skills. Our results illustrate that conditional generative modeling is a powerful tool for decision-making",

    "title": "The Lie Derivative for Measuring Learned Equivariance",
    "volume": "oral",
    "abstract": "Equivariance guarantees that a model's predictions capture key symmetries in data. When an image is translated or rotated, an equivariant model's representation of that image will translate or rotate accordingly. The success of convolutional neural networks has historically been tied to translation equivariance directly encoded in their architecture. The rising success of vision transformers, which have no explicit architectural bias towards equivariance, challenges this narrative and suggests that augmentations and training data might also play a significant role in their performance. In order to better understand the role of equivariance in recent vision models, we apply the Lie derivative, a method for measuring equivariance with strong mathematical foundations and minimal hyperparameters. Using the Lie derivative, we study the equivariance properties of hundreds of pretrained models, spanning CNNs, transformers, and Mixer architectures. The scale of our analysis allows us to separate the impact of architecture from other factors like model size or training method. Surprisingly, we find that many violations of equivariance can be linked to spatial aliasing in ubiquitous network layers, such as pointwise non-linearities, and that as models get larger and more accurate they tend to display more equivariance, regardless of architecture. For example, transformers can be more equivariant than convolutional neural networks after training",

    "abstract": "Gradient-based learning algorithms have an implicit \\emph{simplicity bias} which in effect can limit the diversity of predictors being sampled by the learning procedure. This behavior can hinder the transferability of trained models by (i) favoring the learning of simpler but spurious features --- present in the training data but absent from the test data --- and (ii) by only leveraging a small subset of predictive features. Such an effect is especially magnified when the test distribution does not exactly match the train distribution---referred to as the Out of Distribution (OOD) generalization problem. However, given only the training data, it is not always possible to apriori assess if a given feature is spurious or transferable. Instead, we advocate for learning an ensemble of models which capture a diverse set of predictive features. Towards this, we propose a new algorithm D-BAT (Diversity-By-disAgreement Training), which enforces agreement among the models on the training data, but disagreement on the OOD data. We show how D-BAT naturally emerges from the notion of generalized discrepancy, as well as demonstrate in multiple experiments how the proposed method can mitigate shortcut-learning, enhance uncertainty and OOD detection, as well as improve transferability",

    "title": "Efficient Conditionally Invariant Representation Learning",

    "abstract": "We introduce the Conditional Independence Regression CovariancE (CIRCE), a measure of conditional independence for multivariate continuous-valued variables. CIRCE applies as a regularizer in settings where we wish to learn neural features $\\varphi(X)$ of data $X$ to estimate a target $Y$, while being conditionally independent of a distractor $Z$ given $Y$. Both $Z$ and $Y$ are assumed to be continuous-valued but relatively low dimensional, whereas $X$ and its features may be complex and high dimensional. Relevant settings include domain-invariant learning, fairness, and causal learning. The procedure requires just a single ridge regression from $Y$ to kernelized features of $Z$, which can be done in advance. It is then only necessary to enforce independence of $\\varphi(X)$ from residuals of this regression, which is possible with attractive estimation properties and consistency guarantees. By contrast, earlier measures of conditional feature dependence require multiple regressions for each step of feature learning, resulting in more severe bias and variance, and greater computational cost. When sufficiently rich features are used, we establish that CIRCE is zero if and only if $\\varphi(X) \\perp \\!\\!\\! \\perp Z \\mid Y$.

    "volume": "oral",
    "abstract": "While some state-of-the-art artificial neural network systems in computer vision are strikingly accurate models of the corresponding primate visual processing, there are still many discrepancies between these models and the behavior of primates on object recognition tasks. Many current models suffer from extreme sensitivity to adversarial attacks and often do not align well with the image-by-image behavioral error patterns observed in humans. Previous research has provided strong evidence that primate object recognition behavior can be very accurately predicted by neural population activity in the inferior temporal (IT) cortex, a brain area in the late stages of the visual processing hierarchy. Therefore, here we directly test whether making the late stage representations of models more similar to that of macaque IT produces new models that exhibit more robust, primate-like behavior. We conducted chronic, large-scale multi-electrode recordings across the IT cortex in six non-human primates (rhesus macaques). We then use these data to fine-tune (end-to-end) the model \"IT\" representations such that they are more aligned with the biological IT representations, while preserving accuracy on object recognition tasks. We generate a cohort of models with a range of IT similarity scores validated on held-out animals across two image sets with distinct statistics. Across a battery of optimization conditions, we observed a strong correlation between the models' IT-likeness and alignment with human behavior, as well as an increase in its adversarial robustness. We further assessed the limitations of this approach and find that the improvements in behavioral alignment and adversarial robustness generalize across different image statistics, but not to object categories outside of those covered in our IT training set. Taken together, our results demonstrate that building models that are more aligned with the primate brain leads to more robust and human-like behavior, and call for larger neural data-sets to further augment these gains",

We investigate this question in the setting of learning automata, discrete dynamical systems naturally suited to recurrent modeling and expressing algorithmic tasks. Our theoretical results completely characterize shortcut solutions, whereby a shallow Transformer with only $o(T)$ layers can exactly replicate the computation of an automaton on an input sequence of length $T$. By representing automata using the algebraic structure of their underlying transformation semigroups, we obtain $O(\\log T)$-depth simulators for all automata and $O(1)$-depth simulators for all automata whose associated groups are solvable.

We show that language models tend to perform fairly well at single step inference or entailment tasks, but struggle to chain together multiple reasoning steps to solve more complex problems. In light of this, we propose a Selection-Inference (SI) framework that exploits pre-trained LLMs as general processing modules, and alternates between selection and inference to generate a series of interpretable, casual reasoning steps leading to the final answer. We show that a 7B parameter LLM used within the SI framework in a 5-shot generalisation setting, with no fine-tuning, yields a performance improvement of over 100% compared to an equivalent vanilla baseline on a suite of 10 logical reasoning tasks. The same model in the same setting even outperforms a significantly larger 280B parameter baseline on the same suite of tasks.

We address these issues by instead providing a certificate that demonstrates that the learning algorithm itself is fair, and hence, as a consequence, so too is the trained model. We introduce a method to provide a confidential proof of fairness for training, in the context of widely used decision trees, which we term Confidential-PROFITT. We propose novel fair decision tree learning algorithms along with customized zero-knowledge proof protocols to obtain a proof of fairness that can be audited by a third party. Using zero-knowledge proofs enables us to guarantee confidentiality of both the model and its training data. We show empirically that bounding the information gain of each node with respect to the sensitive attributes reduces the unfairness of the final tree. In extensive experiments on the COMPAS, Communities and Crime, Default Credit, and Adult datasets, we demonstrate that a company can use Confidential-PROFITT to certify the fairness of their decision tree to an auditor in less than 2 minutes, thus indicating the applicability of our approach. This is true for both the demographic parity and equalized odds definitions of fairness. Finally, we extend Confidential-PROFITT to apply to ensembles of trees",

We focus on the $\\epsilon$-coreset for robust clustering, a small proxy of the dataset that preserves the clustering cost within $\\epsilon$-relative error for all center sets. Our main result is an $\\epsilon$-coreset of size $O(m + \\mathrm{poly}(k \\epsilon^{-1}))$ that can be constructed in near-linear time. This significantly improves previous results, which either suffers an exponential dependence on $(m + k)$ [Feldman and Schulman, SODA'12], or has a weaker bi-criteria guarantee [Huang et al., FOCS'18]. Furthermore, we show this dependence in $m$ is nearly-optimal, and the fact that it is isolated from other factors may be crucial for dealing with large number of outliers. We construct our coresets by adapting to the outlier setting a recent framework [Braverman et al., FOCS'22] which was designed for capacity-constrained clustering, overcoming a new challenge that the participating terms in the cost, particularly the excluded $m$ outlier points, are dependent on the center set $C$.

    "title": "Efficiently Computing Nash Equilibria in Adversarial Team Markov Games",
    "volume": "oral",
    "abstract": "Computing Nash equilibrium policies is a central problem in multi-agent reinforcement learning that has received extensive attention both in theory and in practice. However, in light of computational intractability barriers in general-sum games, provable guarantees have been thus far either limited to fully competitive or cooperative scenarios or impose strong assumptions that are difficult to meet in most practical applications. In this work, we depart from those prior results by investigating infinite-horizon \\emph{adversarial team Markov games}, a natural and well-motivated class of games in which a team of identically-interested players---in the absence of any explicit coordination or communication---is competing against an adversarial player. This setting allows for a unifying treatment of zero-sum Markov games and Markov potential games, and serves as a step to model more realistic strategic interactions that feature both competing and cooperative interests. Our main contribution is the first algorithm for computing stationary $\\epsilon$-approximate Nash equilibria in adversarial team Markov games with computational complexity that is polynomial in all the natural parameters of the game, as well as $1/\\epsilon$. The proposed algorithm is based on performing independent policy gradient steps for each player in the team, in tandem with best responses from the side of the adversary; in turn, the policy for the adversary is then obtained by solving a carefully constructed linear program. Our analysis leverages non-standard techniques to establish the KKT optimality conditions for a nonlinear program with nonconvex constraints, thereby leading to a natural interpretation of the induced Lagrange multipliers",

Whereas an S4 layer uses many independent single-input, single-output SSMs, the S5 layer uses one multi-input, multi-output SSM. We establish a connection between S5 and S4, and use this to develop the initialization and parameterization used by the S5 model. The result is a state space layer that can leverage efficient and widely implemented parallel scans, allowing S5 to match the computational efficiency of S4, while also achieving state-of-the-art performance on several long-range sequence modeling tasks.

    "title": "Moving Forward by Moving Backward: Embedding Action Impact over Action Semantics",
    "volume": "oral",
    "abstract": "A common assumption when training embodied agents is that the impact of taking an action is stable; for instance, executing the ``move ahead'' action will always move the agent forward by a fixed distance, perhaps with some small amount of actuator-induced noise. This assumption is limiting; an agent may encounter settings that dramatically alter the impact of actions: a move ahead action on a wet floor may send the agent twice as far as it expects and using the same action with a broken wheel might transform the expected translation into a rotation. Instead of relying that the impact of an action stably reflects its pre-defined semantic meaning, we propose to model the impact of actions on-the-fly using latent embeddings. By combining these latent action embeddings with a novel, transformer-based, policy head, we design an Action Adaptive Policy (AAP). We evaluate our AAP on two challenging visual navigation tasks in the AI2-THOR and Habitat environments and show that our AAP is highly performant even when faced, at inference-time, with missing actions and, previously unseen, perturbed action spaces. Moreover, we observe significant improvement in robustness against these actions when evaluating in real-world scenarios",

In this paper, we present SimPer, a simple contrastive SSL regime for learning periodic information in data. To exploit the periodic inductive bias, SimPer introduces customized augmentations, feature similarity measures, and a generalized contrastive loss for learning efficient and robust periodic representations.

To train PaLI, we make use of large pretrained encoder-decoder language models and Vision Transformers (ViTs).

Since existing Transformers for language are much larger than their vision counterparts, we train a large, 4-billion parameter ViT (ViT-e) to quantify the benefits from even larger-capacity vision models. To train PaLI, we create a large multilingual mix of pretraining tasks, based on a new image-text training set containing 10B images and texts in over 100 languages.

    "abstract": "Temporal domain generalization is a promising yet extremely challenging area where the goal is to learn models under temporally changing data distributions and generalize to unseen data distributions following the trends of the change. The advancement of this area is challenged by: 1) characterizing data distribution drift and its impacts on models, 2) expressiveness in tracking the model dynamics, and 3) theoretical guarantee on the performance. To address them, we propose a Temporal Domain Generalization with Drift-Aware Dynamic Neural Network (DRAIN) framework. Specifically, we formulate the problem into a Bayesian framework that jointly models the relation between data and model dynamics. We then build a recurrent graph generation scenario to characterize the dynamic graph-structured neural networks learned across different time points. It captures the temporal drift of model parameters and data distributions and can predict models in the future without the presence of future data. In addition, we explore theoretical guarantees of the model performance under the challenging temporal DG setting and provide theoretical analysis, including uncertainty and generalization error. Finally, extensive experiments on several real-world benchmarks with temporal drift demonstrate the proposed method's effectiveness and efficiency",

In this work, we introduce Draft, Sketch, and Prove (DSP), a method that maps informal proofs to formal proof sketches, and uses the sketches to guide an automated prover by directing its search to easier sub-problems. We investigate two relevant setups where informal proofs are either written by humans or generated by a language model. Our experiments and ablation studies show that large language models are able to produce well-structured formal sketches that follow the same reasoning steps as the informal proofs.

    "title": "REVISITING PRUNING AT INITIALIZATION THROUGH THE LENS OF RAMANUJAN GRAPH",
    "volume": "oral",
    "abstract": "Pruning neural networks at initialization (PaI) has received an upsurge of interest due to its end-to-end saving potential. PaI is able to find sparse subnetworks at initialization that can achieve comparable performance to the full networks. These methods can surpass the trivial baseline of random pruning but suffer from a significant performance gap compared to post-training pruning. Previous approaches firmly rely on weights, gradients, and sanity checks as primary signals when conducting PaI analysis. To better understand the underlying mechanism of PaI, we propose to interpret it through the lens of the Ramanujan Graph - a class of expander graphs that are sparse while being highly connected. It is often believed there should be a strong correlation between the Ramanujan graph and PaI since both are about finding sparse and well-connected neural networks. However, the finer-grained link relating highly sparse and connected networks to their relative performance (i.e., ranking of difference sparse structures at the same specific global sparsity) is still missing. We observe that not only the Ramanujan property for sparse networks shows no significant relationship to PaI's relative performance, but maximizing it can also lead to the formation of pseudo-random graphs with no structural meanings. We reveal the underlying cause to be Ramanujan Graph's strong assumption on the upper bound of the largest nontrivial eigenvalue (µˆ) of layers belonging to highly sparse networks. We hence propose Iterative Mean Difference of Bound (IMDB) as a mean to relax the µˆ upper bound. Likewise, we also show there exists a lower bound for µˆ, which we call the Normalized Random Coefficient (NaRC), that gives us an accurate assessment for when sparse but highly connected structure degenerates into naive randomness. Finally, we systematically analyze the behavior of various PaI methods and demonstrate the utility of our proposed metrics in characterizing PaI performance. We show that subnetworks preserving better the IMDB property correlate higher in performance, while NaRC provides us with a possible mean to locate the region where highly connected, highly sparse, and non-trivial Ramanujan expanders exist.

    "abstract": "Ultra-High-Definition (UHD) photo has gradually become the standard configuration in advanced imaging devices. The new standard unveils many issues in existing approaches for low-light image enhancement (LLIE), especially in dealing with the intricate issue of joint luminance enhancement and noise removal while remaining efficient. Unlike existing methods that address the problem in the spatial domain, we propose a new solution, UHDFour, that embeds Fourier transform into a cascaded network. Our approach is motivated by a few unique characteristics in the Fourier domain: 1) most luminance information concentrates on amplitudes while noise is closely related to phases, and 2) a high-resolution image and its low-resolution version share similar amplitude patterns. Through embedding Fourier into our network, the amplitude and phase of a low-light image are separately processed to avoid amplifying noise when enhancing luminance. Besides, UHDFour is scalable to UHD images by implementing amplitude and phase enhancement under the low-resolution regime and then adjusting the high-resolution scale with few computations. We also contribute the first real UHD LLIE dataset, UHD-LL, that contains 2,150 low-noise/normal-clear 4K image pairs with diverse darkness and noise levels captured in different scenarios. With this dataset, we systematically analyze the performance of existing LLIE methods for processing UHD images and demonstrate the advantage of our solution.

    "abstract": "Reliable application of machine learning-based decision systems in the wild is one of the major challenges currently investigated by the field. A large portion of established approaches aims to detect erroneous predictions by means of assigning confidence scores. This confidence may be obtained by either quantifying the model's predictive uncertainty, learning explicit scoring functions, or assessing whether the input is in line with the training distribution. Curiously, while these approaches all state to address the same eventual goal of detecting failures of a classifier upon real-world application, they currently constitute largely separated research fields with individual evaluation protocols, which either exclude a substantial part of relevant methods or ignore large parts of relevant failure sources. In this work, we systematically reveal current pitfalls caused by these inconsistencies and derive requirements for a holistic and realistic evaluation of failure detection. To demonstrate the relevance of this unified perspective, we present a large-scale empirical study for the first time enabling benchmarking confidence scoring functions w.r.t all relevant methods and failure sources.

    "abstract": "Graph neural networks (GNNs) for temporal graphs have recently attracted increasing attentions, where a common assumption is that the class set for nodes is closed. However, in real-world scenarios, it often faces the open set problem with the dynamically increased class set as the time passes by. This will bring two big challenges to the existing dynamic GNN methods: (i) How to dynamically propagate appropriate information in an open temporal graph, where new class nodes are often linked to old class nodes. This case will lead to a sharp contradiction. This is because typical GNNs are prone to make the embeddings of connected nodes become similar, while we expect the embeddings of these two interactive nodes to be distinguishable since they belong to different classes. (ii) How to avoid catastrophic knowledge forgetting over old classes when learning new classes occurred in temporal graphs. In this paper, we propose a general and principled learning approach for open temporal graphs, called OTGNet, with the goal of addressing the above two challenges. We assume the knowledge of a node can be disentangled into class-relevant and class-agnostic one, and thus explore a new message passing mechanism by extending the information bottleneck principle to only propagate class-agnostic knowledge between nodes of different classes, avoiding aggregating conflictive information. Moreover, we devise a strategy to select both important and diverse triad sub-graph structures for effective class-incremental learning.

Ideally, the distribution of the data points in the latent space should depend only on the task, the data, the loss, and other architecture-specific constraints. However, factors such as the random weights initialization, training hyperparameters, or other sources of randomness in the training phase may induce incoherent latent spaces that hinder any form of reuse. Nevertheless, we empirically observe that, under the same data and modeling choices, the angles between the encodings within distinct latent spaces do not change. In this work, we propose the latent similarity between each sample and a fixed set of anchors as an alternative data representation, demonstrating that it can enforce the desired invariances without any additional training. We show how neural architectures can leverage these relative representations to guarantee, in practice, invariance to latent isometries and rescalings, effectively enabling latent space communication: from zero-shot model stitching to latent space comparison between diverse settings.

PIXEL is trained to reconstruct the pixels of masked patches instead of predicting a distribution over tokens. We pretrain the 86M parameter PIXEL model on the same English data as BERT and evaluate on syntactic and semantic tasks in typologically diverse languages, including various non-Latin scripts. We find that PIXEL substantially outperforms BERT on syntactic and semantic processing tasks on scripts that are not found in the pretraining data, but PIXEL is slightly weaker than BERT when working with Latin scripts.

    "title": "Clean-image Backdoor: Attacking Multi-label Models with Poisoned Labels Only",
    "volume": "oral",
    "abstract": "Multi-label models have been widely used in various applications including image annotation and object detection. The fly in the ointment is its inherent vulnerability to backdoor attacks due to the adoption of deep learning techniques. However, all existing backdoor attacks exclusively require to modify training inputs (e.g., images), which may be impractical in real-world applications. In this paper, we aim to break this wall and propose the first clean-image backdoor attack, which only poisons the training labels without touching the training samples. Our key insight is that in a multi-label learning task, the adversary can just manipulate the annotations of training samples consisting of a specific set of classes to activate the backdoor. We design a novel trigger exploration method to find convert and effective triggers to enhance the attack performance. We also propose three target label selection strategies to achieve different goals. Experimental results indicate that our clean-image backdoor can achieve a 98% attack success rate while preserving the model's functionality on the benign inputs. Besides, the proposed clean-image backdoor can evade existing state-of-the-art defenses",

    "title": "Graph Neural Networks for Link Prediction with Subgraph Sketching",
    "volume": "oral",
    "abstract": "Many Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) perform poorly compared to simple heuristics on Link Prediction (LP) tasks. This is due to limitations in expressive power such as the inability to count triangles (the backbone of most LP heuristics) and because they can not distinguish automorphic nodes (those having identical structural roles). Both expressiveness issues can be alleviated by learning link (rather than node) representations and incorporating structural features such as triangle counts. Since explicit link representations are often prohibitively expensive, recent works resorted to subgraph-based methods, which have achieved state-of-the-art performance for LP, but suffer from poor efficiency due to high levels of redundancy between subgraphs. We analyze the components of subgraph GNN (SGNN) methods for link prediction. Based on our analysis, we propose a novel full-graph GNN called ELPH (Efficient Link Prediction with Hashing) that passes subgraph sketches as messages to approximate the key components of SGNNs without explicit subgraph construction. ELPH is provably more expressive than Message Passing GNNs (MPNNs). It outperforms existing SGNN models on many standard LP benchmarks while being orders of magnitude faster. However, it shares the common GNN limitation that it is only efficient when the dataset fits in GPU memory. Accordingly, we develop a highly scalable model, called BUDDY, which uses feature precomputation to circumvent this limitation without sacrificing predictive performance. Our experiments show that BUDDY also outperforms SGNNs on standard LP benchmarks while being highly scalable and faster than ELPH",

    "title": "Image to Sphere: Learning Equivariant Features for Efficient Pose Prediction",
    "volume": "oral",
    "abstract": "Predicting the pose of objects from a single image is an important but difficult computer vision problem. Methods that predict a single point estimate do not predict the pose of objects with symmetries well and cannot represent uncertainty. Alternatively, some works predict a distribution over orientations in $\\mathrm{SO}(3)$. However, training such models can be computation- and sample-inefficient. Instead, we propose a novel mapping of features from the image domain to the 3D rotation manifold. Our method then leverages $\\mathrm{SO}(3)$ equivariant layers, which are more sample efficient, and outputs a distribution over rotations that can be sampled at arbitrary resolution. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method at object orientation prediction, and achieve state-of-the-art performance on the popular PASCAL3D+ dataset. Moreover, we show that our method can model complex object symmetries, without any modifications to the parameters or loss function.

    "abstract": "Recently, Transformer-based methods have achieved surprising performance in the field of long-term series forecasting, but the attention mechanism for computing global correlations entails high complexity. And they do not allow for targeted modeling of local features as CNN structures do. To solve the above problems, we propose to combine local features and global correlations to capture the overall view of time series (e.g., fluctuations, trends). To fully exploit the underlying information in the time series, a multi-scale branch structure is adopted to model different potential patterns separately. Each pattern is extracted with down-sampled convolution and isometric convolution for local features and global correlations, respectively. In addition to being more effective, our proposed method, termed as Multi-scale Isometric Convolution Network (MICN), is more efficient with linear complexity about the sequence length with suitable convolution kernels. Our experiments on six benchmark datasets show that compared with state-of-the-art methods, MICN yields 17.2% and 21.6% relative improvements for multivariate and univariate time series, respectively",

    "abstract": "Data heterogeneity is one of the most challenging issues in federated learning, which motivates a variety of approaches to learn personalized models for participating clients. One such approach in deep neural networks based tasks is employing a shared feature representation and learning a customized classifier head for each client. However, previous works do not utilize the global knowledge during local representation learning and also neglect the fine-grained collaboration between local classifier heads, which limits the model generalization ability. In this work, we conduct explicit local-global feature alignment by leveraging global semantic knowledge for learning a better representation. Moreover, we quantify the benefit of classifier combination for each client as a function of the combining weights and derive an optimization problem for estimating optimal weights. Finally, extensive evaluation results on benchmark datasets with various heterogeneous data scenarios demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method",

    "title": "From Play to Policy: Conditional Behavior Generation from Uncurated Robot Data",
    "volume": "oral",
    "abstract": "While large-scale sequence modelling from offline data has led to impressive performance gains in natural language generation and image generation, directly translating such ideas to robotics has been challenging. One critical reason for this is that uncurated robot demonstration data, i.e. play data, collected from non-expert human demonstrators are often noisy, diverse, and distributionally multi-modal. This makes extracting useful, task-centric behaviors from such data a difficult generative modelling problem. In this work, we present Conditional Behavior Transformers (C-BeT), a method that combines the multi-modal generation ability of Behavior Transformer with future-conditioned goal specification. On a suite of simulated benchmark tasks, we find that C-BeT improves upon prior state-of-the-art work in learning from play data by an average of 45.7%. Further, we demonstrate for the first time that useful task-centric behaviors can be learned on a real-world robot purely from play data without any task labels or reward information.

    "title": "Visual Classification via Description from Large Language Models",
    "volume": "oral",
    "abstract": "Vision-language models such as CLIP have shown promising performance on a variety of recognition tasks using the standard zero-shot classification procedure -- computing similarity between the query image and the embedded words for each category. By only using the category name, they neglect to make use of the rich context of additional information that language affords. The procedure gives no intermediate understanding of why a category is chosen, and furthermore provides no mechanism for adjusting the criteria used towards this decision. We present an alternative framework for classification with VLMs, which we call classification by description. We ask VLMs to check for descriptive features rather than broad categories: to find a tiger, look for its stripes; its claws; and more. By basing decisions on these descriptors, we can provide additional cues that encourage using the features we want to be used. In the process, we can get a clear idea of what the model ``thinks\" it is seeing to make its decision; it gains some level of inherent explainability. We query large language models (e.g., GPT-3) for these descriptors to obtain them in a scalable way. Extensive experiments show our framework has numerous advantages past interpretability. We show improvements in accuracy on ImageNet across distribution shifts; demonstrate the ability to adapt VLMs to recognize concepts unseen during training; and illustrate how descriptors can be edited to effectively mitigate bias compared to the baseline",

    "abstract": "Crossmodal knowledge distillation (KD) extends traditional knowledge distillation to the area of multimodal learning and demonstrates great success in various applications. To achieve knowledge transfer across modalities, a pretrained network from one modality is adopted as the teacher to provide supervision signals to a student network learning from the other modality. In contrast to the empirical success reported in prior works, the working mechanism of crossmodal KD remains a mystery. In this paper, we present a thorough understanding of crossmodal KD. We begin by providing two failure cases and demonstrate that KD is not a universal cure in crossmodal knowledge transfer. We then present the modality Venn diagram to understand modality relationships and the modality focusing hypothesis revealing the decisive factor in the efficacy of crossmodal KD. Experimental results on 6 multimodal datasets help justify our hypothesis, diagnose failure cases, and point directions to improve crossmodal knowledge transfer in the future",

    "volume": "oral",
    "abstract": "Variational autoencoders (VAEs) are powerful tools for learning latent representations of data used in a wide range of applications. In practice, VAEs usually require multiple training rounds to choose the amount of information the latent variable should retain. This trade-off between the reconstruction error (distortion) and the KL divergence (rate) is typically parameterized by a hyperparameter $\\beta$. In this paper, we introduce Multi-Rate VAE (MR-VAE), a computationally efficient framework for learning optimal parameters corresponding to various $\\beta$ in a single training run. The key idea is to explicitly formulate a response function using hypernetworks that maps $\\beta$ to the optimal parameters. MR-VAEs construct a compact response hypernetwork where the pre-activations are conditionally gated based on $\\beta$. We justify the proposed architecture by analyzing linear VAEs and showing that it can represent response functions exactly for linear VAEs. With the learned hypernetwork, MR-VAEs can construct the rate-distortion curve without additional training and can be deployed with significantly less hyperparameter tuning. Empirically, our approach is competitive and often exceeds the performance of multiple $\\beta$-VAEs training with minimal computation and memory overheads",

In cases where the expensive transition dynamics can be readily evaluated at specified states (e.g., via a simulator), agents can operate in what is often referred to as planning with a \\emph{generative model}. We propose the AE-LSVI algorithm for best policy identification, a novel variant of the kernelized least-squares value iteration (LSVI) algorithm that combines optimism with pessimism for active exploration (AE). AE-LSVI provably identifies a near-optimal policy \\emph{uniformly} over an entire state space and achieves polynomial sample complexity guarantees that are independent of the number of states. When specialized to the recently introduced offline contextual Bayesian optimization setting, our algorithm achieves improved sample complexity bounds. Experimentally, we demonstrate that AE-LSVI outperforms other RL algorithms in a variety of environments when robustness to the initial state is required",

    "title": "Conditional Antibody Design as 3D Equivariant Graph Translation",
    "volume": "oral",
    "abstract": "Antibody design is valuable for therapeutic usage and biological research. Existing deep-learning-based methods encounter several key issues: 1) incomplete context for Complementarity-Determining Regions (CDRs) generation; 2) incapability of capturing the entire 3D geometry of the input structure; 3) inefficient prediction of the CDR sequences in an autoregressive manner. In this paper, we propose Multi-channel Equivariant Attention Network (MEAN) to co-design 1D sequences and 3D structures of CDRs. To be specific, MEAN formulates antibody design as a conditional graph translation problem by importing extra components including the target antigen and the light chain of the antibody. Then, MEAN resorts to E(3)-equivariant message passing along with a proposed attention mechanism to better capture the geometrical correlation between different components. Finally, it outputs both the 1D sequences and 3D structure via a multi-round progressive full-shot scheme, which enjoys more efficiency and precision against previous autoregressive approaches. Our method significantly surpasses state-of-the-art models in sequence and structure modeling, antigen-binding CDR design, and binding affinity optimization. Specifically, the relative improvement to baselines is about 23\\% in antigen-binding CDR design and 34\\% for affinity optimization",

    "volume": "spotlight",
    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) transfer well to new tasks out-of-the-box simply given a natural language prompt that demonstrates how to perform the task and no additional training. Prompting is a brittle process wherein small modifications to the prompt can cause large variations in the model predictions, and therefore significant effort is dedicated towards designing a painstakingly crafted \"perfect prompt\" for a task. To mitigate the high degree of effort, we instead ask whether collecting multiple decent, yet imperfect, prompts and aggregating them can lead to a high quality prompting strategy. Our observations motivate our proposed method, Ask Me Anything (AMA). We first develop an understanding of the effective prompt formats, finding question-answering (QA) prompts, which encourage open-ended generation (\"Who went to the park?\") tend to outperform those that restrict the model outputs (\"John went to the park. True or False?\"). AMA recursively uses the LLM to transform task inputs to the effective QA format. AM generates multiple questions per input and applies these prompts to collect several noisy \"votes\" for the input's true label. We find the prompts have varying accuracies and dependencies and thus propose to use weak supervision, a procedure for combining the noisy predictions, to produce the final predictions. We evaluate AMA across open-source model families (EleutherAI, BLOOM, OPT, and T0) and sizes (125M-175B parameters), demonstrating an average performance lift of 10.2\\% over the few-shot baseline. This simple strategy enables the open-source GPT-J-6B model to match and exceed the performance of few-shot GPT3-175B on 15 of 20 popular benchmarks. Averaged across these tasks, the GPT-J-6B model outperforms few-shot GPT3-175B. We release our code here: https://github.com/HazyResearch/ama_prompting",

In particular, the graph neural network (GNN) is considered a suitable ML model for optimization problems whose variables and constraints are permutation--invariant, for example, the linear program (LP). While the literature has reported encouraging numerical results, this paper establishes the theoretical foundation of applying GNNs to solving LPs. Given any size limit of LPs, we construct a GNN that maps different LPs to different outputs. We show that properly built GNNs can reliably predict feasibility, boundedness, and an optimal solution for each LP in a broad class. Our proofs are based upon the recently--discovered connections between the Weisfeiler--Lehman isomorphism test and the GNN. To validate our results, we train a simple GNN and present its accuracy in mapping LPs to their feasibilities and solutions",

    "abstract": "Studying the loss landscapes of neural networks is critical to identifying generalizations and avoiding overconfident predictions. Flatness, which measures the perturbation resilience of pre-trained parameters for loss values, is widely acknowledged as an essential predictor of generalization. While the concept of flatness has been formalized as a PAC-Bayes bound, it has been observed that the generalization bounds can vary arbitrarily depending on the scale of the model parameters. Despite previous attempts to address this issue, generalization bounds remain vulnerable to function-preserving scaling transformations or are limited to impractical network structures. In this paper, we introduce new PAC-Bayes prior and posterior distributions invariant to scaling transformations, achieved through the \\textit{decomposition of perturbations into scale and connectivity components}. In this way, this approach expands the range of networks to which the resulting generalization bound can be applied, including those with practical transformations such as weight decay with batch normalization. Moreover, we demonstrate that scale-dependency issues of flatness can adversely affect the uncertainty calibration of Laplace approximation, and we propose a solution using our invariant posterior. Our proposed invariant posterior allows for effective measurement of flatness and calibration with low complexity while remaining invariant to practical parameter transformations, also applying it as a reliable predictor of neural network generalization",

    "abstract": "We describe a minimalistic and interpretable method for unsupervised representation learning that does not require data augmentation, hyperparameter tuning, or other engineering designs, but nonetheless achieves performance close to the state-of-the-art (SOTA) SSL methods. Our approach leverages the sparse manifold transform, which unifies sparse coding, manifold learning, and slow feature analysis. With a one-layer deterministic (one training epoch) sparse manifold transform, it is possible to achieve $99.3\\%$ KNN top-1 accuracy on MNIST, $81.1\\%$ KNN top-1 accuracy on CIFAR-10, and $53.2\\%$ on CIFAR-100. With simple gray-scale augmentation, the model achieves $83.2\\%$ KNN top-1 accuracy on CIFAR-10 and $57\\%$ on CIFAR-100. These results significantly close the gap between simplistic ``white-box'' methods and SOTA methods. We also provide visualization to illustrate how an unsupervised representation transform is formed. The proposed method is closely connected to latent-embedding self-supervised methods and can be treated as the simplest form of VICReg. Though a small performance gap remains between our simple constructive model and SOTA methods, the evidence points to this as a promising direction for achieving a principled and white-box approach to unsupervised representation learning, which has potential to significantly improve learning efficiency",

    "abstract": "There has been a proliferation of artificial intelligence applications, where model training is key to promising high-quality services for these applications. However, the model training process is both time-intensive and energy-intensive, inevitably affecting the user's demand for application efficiency. Layer freezing, an efficient model training technique, has been proposed to improve training efficiency. Although existing layer freezing methods demonstrate the great potential to reduce model training costs, they still remain shortcomings such as lacking generalizability and compromised accuracy. For instance, existing layer freezing methods either require the freeze configurations to be manually defined before training, which does not apply to different networks, or use heuristic freezing criteria that is hard to guarantee decent accuracy in different scenarios. Therefore, there lacks a generic and smart layer freezing method that can automatically perform ``in-situation'' layer freezing for different networks during training processes. To this end, we propose a generic and efficient training framework (SmartFRZ). The core proposed technique in SmartFRZ is attention-guided layer freezing, which can automatically select the appropriate layers to freeze without compromising accuracy. Experimental results show that SmartFRZ effectively reduces the amount of computation in training and achieves significant training acceleration, and outperforms the state-of-the-art layer freezing approaches",

    "abstract": "Reinforcement learning (RL) agents can leverage batches of previously collected data to extract a reasonable control policy. An emerging issue in this offline RL setting, however, is that the bootstrapping update underlying many of our methods suffers from insufficient action-coverage: standard max operator may select a maximal action that has not been seen in the dataset. Bootstrapping from these inaccurate values can lead to overestimation and even divergence. There are a growing number of methods that attempt to approximate an in-sample max, that only uses actions well-covered by the dataset. We highlight a simple fact: it is more straightforward to approximate an in-sample softmax using only actions in the dataset. We show that policy iteration based on the in-sample softmax converges, and that for decreasing temperatures it approaches the in-sample max. We derive an In-Sample Actor-Critic (AC), using this in-sample softmax, and show that it is consistently better or comparable to existing offline RL methods, and is also well-suited to fine-tuning.

    "abstract": "Unsupervised meta-learning aims to learn generalizable knowledge across a distribution of tasks constructed from unlabeled data. Here, the main challenge is how to construct diverse tasks for meta-learning without label information; recent works have proposed to create, e.g., pseudo-labeling via pretrained representations or creating synthetic samples via generative models. However, such a task construction strategy is fundamentally limited due to heavy reliance on the immutable pseudo-labels during meta-learning and the quality of the representations or the generated samples. To overcome the limitations, we propose a simple yet effective unsupervised meta-learning framework, coined Pseudo-supervised Contrast (PsCo), for few-shot classification. We are inspired by the recent self-supervised learning literature; PsCo utilizes a momentum network and a queue of previous batches to improve pseudo-labeling and construct diverse tasks in a progressive manner. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that PsCo outperforms existing unsupervised meta-learning methods under various in-domain and cross-domain few-shot classification benchmarks. We also validate that PsCo is easily scalable to a large-scale benchmark, while recent prior-art meta-schemes are not",

    "volume": "spotlight",
    "abstract": "An energy-based model (EBM) is a popular generative framework that offers both explicit density and architectural flexibility, but training them is difficult since it is often unstable and time-consuming. In recent years, various training techniques have been developed, e.g., better divergence measures or stabilization in MCMC sampling, but there often exists a large gap between EBMs and other generative frameworks like GANs in terms of generation quality. In this paper, we propose a novel and effective framework for improving EBMs via contrastive representation learning (CRL). To be specific, we consider representations learned by contrastive methods as the true underlying latent variable. This contrastive latent variable could guide EBMs to understand the data structure better, so it can improve and accelerate EBM training significantly. To enable the joint training of EBM and CRL, we also design a new class of latent-variable EBMs for learning the joint density of data and the contrastive latent variable. Our experimental results demonstrate that our scheme achieves lower FID scores, compared to prior-art EBM methods (e.g., additionally using variational autoencoders or diffusion techniques), even with significantly faster and more memory-efficient training. We also show conditional and compositional generation abilities of our latent-variable EBMs as their additional benefits, even without explicit conditional training.

A natural question to ask is \\textit{Does the momentum parameter $\\beta$ (say) play a role in implicit regularization in Heavy-ball (H.B) momentum accelerated gradient descent (GD+M)?}. To answer this question, first, we show that the trajectory traced by discrete H.B momentum update (GD+M) is $O(h^2)$ close to a continuous trajectory induced by a modified loss, which consists of an original loss and an implicit regularizer. This implicit regularizer for (GD+M) is indeed stronger than that of (GD) by factor of $(\\frac{1+\\beta}{1-\\beta})$, thus explaining why (GD+M) shows better generalization performance and higher test accuracy than (GD). Furthermore, we extend our analysis to stochastic version of gradient descent with momentum (SGD+M) and propose a deterministic continuous trajectory that is $O(h^2)$ close to the discrete update of (SGD+M) in a strong approximation sense. We explore the implicit regularization in (SGD+M) and (GD+M) through a series of experiments validating our theory",

In this work, we introduce the exponential family variational Kalman filter (eVKF), an online recursive Bayesian method aimed at inferring latent trajectories while simultaneously learning the dynamical system generating them. eVKF works for arbitrary likelihoods and utilizes the constant base measure exponential family to model the latent state stochasticity. We derive a closed-form variational analog to the predict step of the Kalman filter which leads to a provably tighter bound on the ELBO compared to another online variational method.

In the proposed framework, we model energy estimation and data restoration as the forward and backward passes of a single network without any auxiliary components, e.g., an extra decoder. For the forward pass, we fit a network to an energy function that assigns low energy scores to samples that belong to an unlabeled dataset, and high energy otherwise. For the backward pass, we restore data from corrupted versions iteratively using gradient-based optimization along the direction of energy minimization. In this way, we naturally fold the encoder-decoder architecture widely used in masked image modeling into the forward and backward passes of a single vision model. Our framework accepts a wide range of pretext tasks with different data corruption methods, and permits models to be pretrained from masked image modeling, patch sorting, and image restoration, including super-resolution, denoising, and colorization. We support our findings with extensive experiments, and show the proposed method delivers comparable and even better performance with remarkably fewer epochs of training compared to the state-of-the-art self-supervised vision model pretraining methods.

We propose Binder, a training-free neural-symbolic framework that maps the task input to a program, which (1) allows binding a unified API of language model (LM) functionalities to a programming language (e.g., SQL, Python) to extend its grammar coverage and thus tackle more diverse questions, (2) adopts an LM as both the program parser and the underlying model called by the API during execution, and (3) requires only a few in-context exemplar annotations. Specifically, we employ GPT-3 Codex as the LM. In the parsing stage, with only a few in-context exemplars, Codex is able to identify the part of the task input that cannot be answerable by the original programming language, correctly generate API calls to prompt Codex to solve the unanswerable part, and identify where to place the API calls while being compatible with the original grammar. In the execution stage, Codex can perform versatile functionalities (e.g., commonsense QA, information extraction) given proper prompts in the API calls. Binder achieves state-of-the-art results on WikiTableQuestions and TabFact datasets, with explicit output programs that benefit human debugging.

    "abstract": "We present a data-driven, space-time continuous framework to learn surrogate models for complex physical systems described by advection-dominated partial differential equations. Those systems have slow-decaying Kolmogorov n-width that hinders standard methods, including reduced order modeling, from producing high-fidelity simulations at low cost. In this work, we construct hypernetwork-based latent dynamical models directly on the parameter space of a compact representation network. We leverage the expressive power of the network and a specially designed consistency-inducing regularization to obtain latent trajectories that are both low-dimensional and smooth. These properties render our surrogate models highly efficient at inference time. We show the efficacy of our framework by learning models that generate accurate multi-step rollout predictions at much faster inference speed compared to competitors, for several challenging examples",

    "abstract": "How well do reward functions learned with inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) generalize? We illustrate that state-of-the-art IRL algorithms, which maximize a maximum-entropy objective, learn rewards that overfit to the demonstrations. Such rewards struggle to provide meaningful rewards for states not covered by the demonstrations, a major detriment when using the reward to learn policies in new situations. We introduce BC-IRL a new inverse reinforcement learning method that learns reward functions that generalize better when compared to maximum-entropy IRL approaches. In contrast to the MaxEnt framework, which learns to maximize rewards around demonstrations, BC-IRL updates reward parameters such that the policy trained with the new reward matches the expert demonstrations better. We show that BC-IRL learns rewards that generalize better on an illustrative simple task and two continuous robotic control tasks, achieving over twice the success rate of baselines in challenging generalization settings",

    "volume": "spotlight",
    "abstract": "Dynamical systems are found in innumerable forms across the physical and biological sciences, yet all these systems fall naturally into equivalence classes: conservative or dissipative, stable or unstable, compressible or incompressible. Predicting these classes from data remains an essential open challenge in computational physics on which existing time-series classification methods struggle. Here, we propose, phase2vec, an embedding method that learns high-quality, physically-meaningful representations of low-dimensional dynamical systems without supervision. Our embeddings are produced by a convolutional backbone that extracts geometric features from flow data and minimizes a physically-informed vector field reconstruction loss. The trained architecture can not only predict the equations of unseen data, but also produces embeddings that encode meaningful physical properties of input data (e.g. stability of fixed points, conservation of energy, and the incompressibility of flows) more faithfully than standard blackbox classifiers and state-of-the-art time series classification techniques. We additionally apply our embeddings to the analysis of meteorological data, showing we can detect climatically meaningful features. Collectively, our results demonstrate the viability of embedding approaches for the discovery of dynamical features in physical systems",

Instead of constructing a non-Markov noising process as in the original DDIM, we examine the mechanism of DDIM from a numerical perspective. We discover that the DDIM can be obtained by using some specific approximations of the score when solving the corresponding stochastic differential equation. We present an interpretation of the accelerating effects of DDIM that also explains the advantages of a deterministic sampling scheme over the stochastic one for fast sampling. Building on this insight, we extend DDIM to general DMs, coined generalized DDIM (gDDIM), with a small but delicate modification in parameterizing the score network. We validate gDDIM in two non-isotropic DMs: Blurring diffusion model (BDM) and Critically-damped Langevin diffusion model (CLD). We observe more than 20 times acceleration in BDM. In the CLD, a diffusion model by augmenting the diffusion process with velocity, our algorithm achieves an FID score of 2.26, on CIFAR10, with only 50 number of score function evaluations~(NFEs) and an FID score of 2.86 with only 27 NFEs",

    "volume": "spotlight",
    "abstract": "Federated Averaging (FedAvg) remains the most popular algorithm for Federated Learning (FL) optimization due to its simple implementation, stateless nature, and privacy guarantees combined with secure aggregation. Recent work has sought to generalize the vanilla averaging in FedAvg to a generalized gradient descent step by treating client updates as pseudo-gradients and using a server step size. While the use of a server step size has been shown to provide performance improvement theoretically, the practical benefit of the server step size has not been seen in most existing works. In this work, we present FedExP, a method to adaptively determine the server step size in FL based on dynamically varying pseudo-gradients throughout the FL process. We begin by considering the overparameterized convex regime, where we reveal an interesting similarity between FedAvg and the Projection Onto Convex Sets (POCS) algorithm. We then show how FedExP can be motivated as a novel extension to the extrapolation mechanism that is used to speed up POCS. Our theoretical analysis later also discusses the implications of FedExP in underparameterized and non-convex settings. Experimental results show that FedExP consistently converges faster than FedAvg and competing baselines on a range of realistic FL datasets",

In this paper, we study graph compression to reduce the storage requirement for GNN in serving. Given a GNN model to be served, we propose to construct a compressed graph with a smaller number of nodes. In serving time, one just needs to replace the original training set graph by this compressed graph, without the need of changing the actual GNN model and the forward pass. We carefully analyze the error in the forward pass and derive simple ways to construct the compressed graph to minimize the approximation error. Experimental results on semi-supervised node classification demonstrate that the proposed method can significantly reduce the serving space requirement for GNN inference",

    "title": "Learning MLPs on Graphs: A Unified View of Effectiveness, Robustness, and Efficiency",
    "volume": "spotlight",
    "abstract": "While Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated their efficacy in dealing with non-Euclidean structural data, they are difficult to be deployed in real applications due to the scalability constraint imposed by the multi-hop data dependency. Existing methods attempt to address this scalability issue by training student multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) exclusively on node content features using labels derived from the teacher GNNs. However, the trained MLPs are neither effective nor robust. In this paper, we ascribe the lack of effectiveness and robustness to three significant challenges: 1) the misalignment between content feature and label spaces, 2) the strict hard matching to teacher's output, and 3) the sensitivity to node feature noises. To address the challenges, we propose NOSMOG, a novel method to learn NOise-robust Structure-aware MLPs On Graphs, with remarkable effectiveness, robustness, and efficiency. Specifically, we first address the misalignment by complementing node content with position features to capture the graph structural information. We then design an innovative representational similarity distillation strategy to inject soft node similarities into MLPs. Finally, we introduce adversarial feature augmentation to ensure stable learning against feature noises. Extensive experiments and theoretical analyses demonstrate the superiority of NOSMOG by comparing it to GNNs and the state-of-the-art method in both transductive and inductive settings across seven datasets.

    "abstract": "In this work, we explore the maximum-margin bias of quasi-homogeneous neural networks trained with gradient flow on an exponential loss and past a point of separability. We introduce the class of quasi-homogeneous models, which is expressive enough to describe nearly all neural networks with homogeneous activations, even those with biases, residual connections, and normalization layers, while structured enough to enable geometric analysis of its gradient dynamics. Using this analysis, we generalize the existing results of maximum-margin bias for homogeneous networks to this richer class of models. We find that gradient flow implicitly favors a subset of the parameters, unlike in the case of a homogeneous model where all parameters are treated equally. We demonstrate through simple examples how this strong favoritism toward minimizing an asymmetric norm can degrade the robustness of quasi-homogeneous models. On the other hand, we conjecture that this norm-minimization discards, when possible, unnecessary higher-order parameters, reducing the model to a sparser parameterization. Lastly, by applying our theorem to sufficiently expressive neural networks with normalization layers, we reveal a universal mechanism behind the empirical phenomenon of Neural Collapse",

    "volume": "spotlight",
    "abstract": "With the advent of large datasets, offline reinforcement learning is a promising framework for learning good decision-making policies without the need to interact with the real environment. However, offline RL requires the dataset to be reward-annotated, which presents practical challenges when reward engineering is difficult or when obtaining reward annotations is labor-intensive. In this paper, we introduce Optimal Transport Relabeling (OTR), an imitation learning algorithm that can automatically relabel offline data of mixed and unknown quality with rewards from a few good demonstrations. OTR's key idea is to use optimal transport to compute an optimal alignment between an unlabeled trajectory in the dataset and an expert demonstration to obtain a similarity measure that can be interpreted as a reward, which can then be used by an offline RL algorithm to learn the policy. OTR is easy to implement and computationally efficient. On D4RL benchmarks, we demonstrate that OTR with a single demonstration can consistently match the performance of offline RL with ground-truth rewards",

    "volume": "spotlight",
    "abstract": "We tackle the problem of aligning pre-trained large language models (LMs) with human preferences. If we view text generation as a sequential decision-making problem, reinforcement learning (RL) appears to be a natural conceptual framework. However, using RL for LM-based generation faces empirical challenges, including training instability due to the combinatorial action space, as well as a lack of open-source libraries and benchmarks customized for LM alignment. Thus, a question rises in the research community: is RL a practical paradigm for NLP? To help answer this, we first introduce an open-source modular library, $RL4LMs$ (Reinforcement Learning for Language Models), for optimizing language generators with RL. The library consists of on-policy RL algorithms that can be used to train any encoder or encoder-decoder LM in the HuggingFace library (Wolf et al. 2020) with an arbitrary reward function. Next, we present the $GRUE$ (General Reinforced-language Understanding Evaluation) benchmark, a set of 6 language generation tasks which are supervised not by target strings, but by reward functions which capture automated measures of human preference.GRUE is the first leaderboard-style evaluation of RL algorithms for NLP tasks. Finally, we introduce an easy-to-use, performant RL algorithm, $NLPO$ (Natural Language Policy Optimization)} that learns to effectively reduce the combinatorial action space in language generation. We show 1) that RL techniques are generally better than supervised methods at aligning LMs to human preferences; and 2) that NLPO exhibits greater stability and performance than previous policy gradient methods (e.g., PPO (Schulman et al. 2017)), based on both automatic and human evaluations",

    "abstract": "Deep neural networks can learn powerful prior probability models for images, as evidenced by the high-quality generations obtained with recent score-based diffusion methods. But the means by which these networks capture complex global statistical structure, apparently without suffering from the curse of dimensionality, remain a mystery. To study this, we incorporate diffusion methods into a multi-scale decomposition, reducing dimensionality by assuming a stationary local Markov model for wavelet coefficients conditioned on coarser-scale coefficients. We instantiate this model using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with local receptive fields, which enforce both the stationarity and Markov properties. Global structures are captured using a CNN with receptive fields covering the entire (but small) low-pass image. We test this model on a dataset of face images, which are highly non-stationary and contain large-scale geometric structures. Remarkably, denoising, super-resolution, and image synthesis results all demonstrate that these structures can be captured with significantly smaller conditioning neighborhoods than required by a Markov model implemented in the pixel domain. Our results show that score estimation for large complex images can be reduced to low-dimensional Markov conditional models across scales, alleviating the curse of dimensionality",

We demonstrate these constraints lead to disentanglement in a variety of tasks and architectures, including variational autoencoders. We also use this theory to explain why the brain partitions its cells into distinct cell types such as grid and object-vector cells, and also explain when the brain instead entangles representations in response to entangled task factors. Overall, this work provides a mathematical understanding of why single neurons in the brain often represent single human-interpretable factors, and steps towards an understanding task structure shapes the structure of brain representation",

    "abstract": "Simulating rigid collisions among arbitrary shapes is notoriously difficult due to complex geometry and the strong non-linearity of the interactions. While graph neural network (GNN)-based models are effective at learning to simulate complex physical dynamics, such as fluids, cloth and articulated bodies, they have been less effective and efficient on rigid-body physics, except with very simple shapes. Existing methods that model collisions through the meshes' nodes are often inaccurate because they struggle when collisions occur on faces far from nodes. Alternative approaches that represent the geometry densely with many particles are prohibitively expensive for complex shapes. Here we introduce the ``Face Interaction Graph Network'' (FIGNet) which extends beyond GNN-based methods, and computes interactions between mesh faces, rather than nodes. Compared to learned node- and particle-based methods, FIGNet is around 4x more accurate in simulating complex shape interactions, while also 8x more computationally efficient on sparse, rigid meshes. Moreover, FIGNet can learn frictional dynamics directly from real-world data, and can be more accurate than analytical solvers given modest amounts of training data. FIGNet represents a key step forward in one of the few remaining physical domains which have seen little competition from learned simulators, and offers allied fields such as robotics, graphics and mechanical design a new tool for simulation and model-based planning",

We then inquire under which conditions the global minima of the loss recover the `true' rank of the data: we show that for too large depths the global minimum will be approximately rank 1 (underestimating the rank); we then argue that there is a range of depths which grows with the number of datapoints where the true rank is recovered.

    "abstract": "Discovering causal relationships between different variables from time series data has been a long-standing challenge for many domains. For example, in stock markets, the announcement of acquisitions from leading companies may have immediate effects on stock prices and increase the uncertainty of the future market due to this past action. To discover causal relations in such case, the model needs to consider non-linear relations between variables, instantaneous effect and the change of noise distribution due to past actions. We name the latter as history-dependent noise. However, previous works do not offer a solution addressing all these problems together. In this paper, we propose a structural equation model, called Rhino, which combines vector auto-regression, deep learning and variational inference to model non-linear relationships with instantaneous effects while allowing the noise distribution to be modulated by history observations. Theoretically, we prove the structural identifiability of Rhino.

Furthermore, we learn a probabilistic model that can perform inference tasks in such a topological/structural representation space. Our method generates true structures rather than pixel-maps, leading to better topological integrity in automatic segmentation tasks.

This setting, also known as causal Bayesian optimization (CBO), has important applications in medicine, ecology, and manufacturing. Standard Bayesian optimization algorithms fail to effectively leverage the underlying causal structure. Existing CBO approaches assume noiseless measurements and do not come with guarantees. We propose the {\\em model-based causal Bayesian optimization algorithm (MCBO)} that learns a full system model instead of only modeling intervention-reward pairs. MCBO propagates epistemic uncertainty about the causal mechanisms through the graph and trades off exploration and exploitation via the optimism principle. We bound its cumulative regret, and obtain the first non-asymptotic bounds for CBO. Unlike in standard Bayesian optimization, our acquisition function cannot be evaluated in closed form, so we show how the reparameterization trick can be used to apply gradient-based optimizers. The resulting practical implementation of MCBO compares favorably with state-of-the-art approaches empirically",

    "title": "Training language models to summarize narratives improves brain alignment",
    "volume": "spotlight",
    "abstract": "Building systems that achieve a deeper understanding of language is one of the central goals of natural language processing (NLP). Towards this goal, recent works have begun to train language models on narrative datasets which require extracting the most critical information by integrating across long contexts. However, it is still an open question whether these models are learning a deeper understanding of the text, or if the models are simply learning a heuristic to complete the task. This work investigates this further by turning to the one language processing system that truly understands complex language: the human brain. We show that training language models for deeper narrative understanding results in richer representations that have improved alignment to human brain activity. We further find that the improvements in brain alignment are larger for character names than for other discourse features, which indicates that these models are learning important narrative elements. Taken together, these results suggest that this type of training can indeed lead to deeper language understanding. These findings have consequences both for cognitive neuroscience by revealing some of the significant factors behind brain-NLP alignment, and for NLP by highlighting that understanding of long-range context can be improved beyond language modeling",

    "abstract": "Neural Algorithmic Reasoning is an emerging area of machine learning which seeks to infuse algorithmic computation in neural networks, typically by training neural models to approximate steps of classical algorithms. In this context, much of the current work has focused on learning reachability and shortest path graph algorithms, showing that joint learning on similar algorithms is beneficial for generalisation. However, when targeting more complex problems, such \"similar\" algorithms become more difficult to find. Here, we propose to learn algorithms by exploiting duality of the underlying algorithmic problem. Many algorithms solve optimisation problems. We demonstrate that simultaneously learning the dual definition of these optimisation problems in algorithmic learning allows for better learning and qualitatively better solutions. Specifically, we exploit the max-flow min-cut theorem to simultaneously learn these two algorithms over synthetically generated graphs, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed approach. We then validate the real-world utility of our dual algorithmic reasoner by deploying it on a challenging brain vessel classification task, which likely depends on the vessels' flow properties. We demonstrate a clear performance gain when using our model within such a context, and empirically show that learning the max-flow and min-cut algorithms together is critical for achieving such a result",

To provide a principled framework for constructing attention layers in transformers, we show that the self-attention corresponds to the support vector expansion derived from a support vector regression problem, whose primal formulation has the form of a neural network layer. Using our framework, we derive popular attention layers used in practice and propose two new attentions: 1) the Batch Normalized Attention (Attention-BN) derived from the batch normalization layer and 2) the Attention with Scaled Head (Attention-SH) derived from using less training data to fit the SVR model. We empirically demonstrate the advantages of the Attention-BN and Attention-SH in reducing head redundancy, increasing the model's accuracy, and improving the model's efficiency in a variety of practical applications including image and time-series classification",

    "volume": "spotlight",
    "abstract": "Incorporating second-order gradient information (curvature) into optimization can dramatically reduce the number of iterations required to train machine learning models. In natural gradient descent, such information comes from the Fisher information matrix which yields a number of desirable properties. As exact natural gradient updates are intractable for large models, successful methods such as KFAC and sequels approximate the Fisher in a structured form that can easily be inverted. However, this requires model/layer-specific tensor algebra and certain approximations that are often difficult to justify. Here, we use ideas from Legendre-Fenchel duality to learn a direct and efficiently evaluated model for the product of the inverse Fisher with any vector, in an online manner, leading to natural gradient steps that get progressively more accurate over time despite noisy gradients. We prove that the resulting \"Fisher-Legendre\" (FishLeg) optimizer converges to a (global) minimum of non-convex functions satisfying the PL condition, which applies in particular to deep linear networks. On standard auto-encoder benchmarks, we show empirically that FishLeg outperforms standard first-order optimization methods, and performs on par with or better than other second-order methods, especially when using small batches. Thanks to its generality, we expect our approach to facilitate the handling of a variety neural network layers in future work",

    "title": "Capturing the Motion of Every Joint: 3D Human Pose and Shape Estimation with Independent Tokens",
    "volume": "spotlight",
    "abstract": "In this paper we present a novel method to estimate 3D human pose and shape from monocular videos. This task requires directly recovering pixel-alignment 3D human pose and body shape from monocular images or videos, which is challenging due to its inherent ambiguity. To improve precision, existing methods highly rely on the initialized mean pose and shape as prior estimates and parameter regression with an iterative error feedback manner. In addition, video-based approaches model the overall change over the image-level features to temporally enhance the single-frame feature, but fail to capture the rotational motion at the joint level, and cannot guarantee local temporal consistency. To address these issues, we propose a novel Transformer-based model with a design of independent tokens. First, we introduce three types of tokens independent of the image feature: \\textit{joint rotation tokens, shape token, and camera token}. By progressively interacting with image features through Transformer layers, these tokens learn to encode the prior knowledge of human 3D joint rotations, body shape, and position information from large-scale data, and are updated to estimate SMPL parameters conditioned on a given image. Second, benefiting from the proposed token-based representation, we further use a temporal model to focus on capturing the rotational temporal information of each joint, which is empirically conducive to preventing large jitters in local parts. Despite being conceptually simple, the proposed method attains superior performances on the 3DPW and Human3.6M datasets. Using ResNet-50 and Transformer architectures, it obtains 42.0 mm error on the PA-MPJPE metric of the challenging 3DPW, outperforming state-of-the-art counterparts by a large margin.

    "volume": "spotlight",
    "abstract": "Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are well suited for solving sequence tasks in resource-constrained systems due to their expressivity and low computational requirements. However, there is still a need to bridge the gap between what RNNs are capable of in terms of efficiency and performance and real-world application requirements. The memory and computational requirements arising from propagating the activations of all the neurons at every time step to every connected neuron, together with the sequential dependence of activations, contribute to the inefficiency of training and using RNNs. We propose a solution inspired by biological neuron dynamics that makes the communication between RNN units sparse and discrete. This makes the backward pass with backpropagation through time (BPTT) computationally sparse and efficient as well. We base our model on the gated recurrent unit (GRU), extending it with units that emit discrete events for communication triggered by a threshold so that no information is communicated to other units in the absence of events. We show theoretically that the communication between units, and hence the computation required for both the forward and backward passes, scales with the number of events in the network. Our model achieves efficiency without compromising task performance, demonstrating competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art recurrent network models in real-world tasks, including language modeling. The dynamic activity sparsity mechanism also makes our model well suited for novel energy-efficient neuromorphic hardware. Code is available at https://github.com/KhaleelKhan/EvNN/",

    "title": "Flow Straight and Fast: Learning to Generate and Transfer Data with Rectified Flow",

    "abstract": "We present rectified flow, a simple approach to learning (neural) ordinary differential equation (ODE) models to transport between two empirically observed distributions $\\pi_0$ and $\\pi_1$, hence providing a unified solution to generative modeling and domain transfer, among various other tasks involving distribution transport. The idea of rectified flow is to learn the ODE to follow the straight paths connecting the points drawn from $\\pi_0$ and $\\pi_1$ as much as possible. This is achieved by solving a straightforward nonlinear least squares optimization problem, which can be easily scaled to large models without introducing extra parameters beyond standard supervised learning. The straight paths are the shortest paths between two points, and can be simulated exactly without time discretization and hence yield computationally efficient models. We show that, by learning a rectified flow from data, we effectively turn an arbitrary coupling of $\\pi_0$ and $\\pi_1$ to a new deterministic coupling with provably non-increasing convex transport costs. In addition, with a ``reflow\" procedure that iteratively learns a new rectified flow from the data bootstrapped from the previous one, we obtain a sequence of flows with increasingly straight paths, which can be simulated accurately with coarse time discretization in the inference phase. In empirical studies, we show that rectified flow performs superbly on image generation, image-to-image translation, and domain adaptation. In particular, on image generation and translation, our method yields nearly straight flows that give high quality results even with \\emph{a single Euler discretization step}.

    "abstract": "The appearance of adversarial examples raises attention from both academia and industry. Along with the attack-defense arms race, adversarial training is the most effective against adversarial examples. However, we find inequality phenomena occur during the $l_{\\infty}$-adversarial training, that few features dominate the prediction made by the adversarially trained model. We systematically evaluate such inequality phenomena by extensive experiments and find such phenomena become more obvious when performing adversarial training with increasing adversarial strength (evaluated by $\\epsilon$). We hypothesize such inequality phenomena make $l_{\\infty}$-adversarially trained model less reliable than the standard trained model when few ``important features\" are influenced. To validate our hypothesis, we proposed two simple attacks that either perturb or replace important features with noise or occlusion. Experiments show that $l_{\\infty}$-adversarially trained model can be easily attacked when the few important features are influenced.

However, because diffusion processes are most naturally applied on the unconstrained Euclidean space $\\mathrm{R}^d$, key challenges arise for developing diffusion based models for learning data on constrained and structured domains. We present a simple and unified framework to achieve this that can be easily adopted to various types of domains, including product spaces of any type (be it bounded/unbounded, continuous/discrete, categorical/ordinal, or their mix). In our model, the diffusion process is driven by a drift force that is a sum of two terms: one singular force designed by $Doob's~ h$-$transform$ that ensures all outcomes of the process to belong to the desirable domain, and one non-singular neural force field that is trained to make sure the outcome follows the data distribution statistically.

    "abstract": "Partial label learning (PLL) is a typical weakly supervised learning problem, where each training example is associated with a set of candidate labels among which only one is true. Most existing PLL approaches assume that the incorrect labels in each training example are randomly picked as the candidate labels and model the generation process of the candidate labels in a simple way. However, these approaches usually do not perform as well as expected due to the fact that the generation process of the candidate labels is always instance-dependent. Therefore, it deserves to be modeled in a refined way. In this paper, we consider instance-dependent PLL and assume that the generation process of the candidate labels could decompose into two sequential parts, where the correct label emerges first in the mind of the annotator but then the incorrect labels related to the feature are also selected with the correct label as candidate labels due to uncertainty of labeling. Motivated by this consideration, we propose a novel PLL method that performs Maximum A Posterior(MAP) based on an explicitly modeled generation process of candidate labels via decomposed probability distribution models.

Existing methods are typically based on either fixed-size models that struggle to learn a large number of diverse behaviors, or growing-size models that scale poorly with the number of tasks.

We introduce Continual Subspace of Policies (CSP), a new approach that incrementally builds a subspace of policies for training a reinforcement learning agent on a sequence of tasks. The subspace's high expressivity allows CSP to perform well for many different tasks while growing more slowly than the number of tasks. Our method does not suffer from forgetting and also displays positive transfer to new tasks.

Inspired by the efficacy of the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) method in the single-objective context, we generalize ADMM to derive a first-order method for cVIs, that we refer to as ADMM-based interior-point method for constrained VIs (ACVI). We provide convergence guarantees for ACVI in two general classes of problems: (i) when the operator is $\\xi$-monotone, and (ii) when it is monotone, some constraints are active and the game is not purely rotational. When the operator is in addition L-Lipschitz for the latter case, we match known lower bounds on rates for the gap function of $\\mathcal{O}(1/\\sqrt{K})$ and $\\mathcal{O}(1/K)$ for the last and average iterate, respectively. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first presentation of a first-order interior-point method for the general cVI problem that has a global convergence guarantee. Moreover, unlike previous work in this setting, ACVI provides a means to solve cVIs when the constraints are nontrivial. Empirical analyses demonstrate clear advantages of ACVI over common first-order methods. In particular, (i) cyclical behavior is notably reduced as our methods approach the solution from the analytic center, and (ii) unlike projection-based methods that zigzag when near a constraint, ACVI efficiently handles the constraints",

Despite the significance, ground states preparation (GSP) is classically intractable for large-scale Hamiltonians. Quantum neural networks (QNNs), which exert the power of modern quantum machines, have emerged as a leading protocol to conquer this issue. As such, the performance enhancement of QNNs becomes the core in GSP. Empirical evidence showed that QNNs with handcraft symmetric ans\\\"atze generally experience better trainability than those with asymmetric ans\\\"atze, while theoretical explanations remain vague. To fill this knowledge gap, here we propose the effective quantum neural tangent kernel (EQNTK) and connect this concept with over-parameterization theory to quantify the convergence of QNNs towards the global optima. We uncover that the advance of symmetric ans\\\"atze attributes to their large EQNTK value with low effective dimension, which requests few parameters and quantum circuit depth to reach the over-parameterization regime permitting a benign loss landscape and fast convergence. Guided by EQNTK, we further devise a symmetric pruning (SP) scheme to automatically tailor a symmetric ansatz from an over-parameterized and asymmetric one to greatly improve the performance of QNNs when the explicit symmetry information of Hamiltonian is unavailable. Extensive numerical simulations are conducted to validate the analytical results of EQNTK and the effectiveness of SP",

We examine how this method can be used also for the neural gradients (i.e. loss gradients with respect to the intermediate neural layer outputs). To this end, we first establish a tensor-level optimality criteria. Previous works aimed to minimize the mean-square-error (MSE) of each pruned block. We show that while minimization of the MSE works fine for pruning the weights and activations, it catastrophically fails for the neural gradients. Instead, we show that accurate pruning of the neural gradients requires an unbiased minimum-variance pruning mask. We design such specialized masks, and find that in most cases, 1:2 sparsity is sufficient for training, and 2:4 sparsity is usually enough when this is not the case. Further, we suggest combining several such methods together in order to potentially speed up training even more. A reference implementation is supplied in the supplementary material",

    "abstract": "Fully-parametric language models generally require a huge number of model parameters to store the necessary knowledge for solving multiple natural language tasks in zero/few-shot settings. In addition, it is hard to adapt to the evolving world knowledge without the costly model re-training. In this paper, we develop a novel semi-parametric language model architecture, Knowledge-in-Context (KiC), which empowers a parametric text-to-text language model with a knowledge-rich external memory. Specifically, the external memory contains six different types of knowledge: entity, dictionary, commonsense, event, script, and causality knowledge. For each input instance, the KiC model adaptively selects a knowledge type and retrieves the most helpful pieces of knowledge. The input instance along with its knowledge augmentation is fed into a text-to-text model (e.g., T5) to generate the output answer, where both the input and the output are in natural language forms after prompting. Interestingly, we find that KiC can be identified as a special mixture-of-experts (MoE) model, where the knowledge selector plays the role of a router that is used to determine the sequence-to-expert assignment in MoE. This key observation inspires us to develop a novel algorithm for training KiC with an instance-adaptive knowledge selector. As a knowledge-rich semi-parametric language model, KiC only needs a much smaller parametric part to achieve superior zero-shot performance on unseen tasks. By evaluating on 40+ different tasks, we show that KiC-Large with 770M parameters easily outperforms large language models that are 4-39x larger. In addition, KiC also exhibits emergent abilities at a much smaller model scale compared to the fully-parametric models",

    "abstract": "Self-supervised learning has achieved significant success in learning visual representations without the need for manual annotation. To obtain generalizable representations, a meticulously designed data augmentation strategy is one of the most crucial parts. Recently, multi-crop strategies utilizing a set of small crops as positive samples have been shown to learn spatially structured features. However, it overlooks the diverse contextual backgrounds, which reduces the variance of the input views and degenerates the performance. To address this problem, we propose a mosaic representation learning framework (MosRep), consisting of a new data augmentation strategy that enriches the backgrounds of each small crop and improves the quality of visual representations. Specifically, we randomly sample numbers of small crops from different input images and compose them into a mosaic view, which is equivalent to introducing different background information for each small crop. Additionally, we further jitter the mosaic view to prevent memorizing the spatial locations of each crop. Along with optimization, our MosRep gradually extracts more discriminative features. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our method improves the performance far greater than the multi-crop strategy on a series of downstream tasks, e.g., +7.4% and +4.9% than the multi-crop strategy on ImageNet-1K with 1% label and 10% label, respectively.

    "abstract": "Humans manipulate various kinds of fluids in their everyday life: creating latte art, scooping floating objects from water, rolling an ice cream cone, etc. Using robots to augment or replace human labors in these daily settings remain as a challenging task due to the multifaceted complexities of fluids. Previous research in robotic fluid manipulation mostly consider fluids governed by an ideal, Newtonian model in simple task settings (e.g., pouring water into a container). However, the vast majority of real-world fluid systems manifest their complexities in terms of the fluid's complex material behaviors (e.g., elastoplastic deformation) and multi-component interactions (e.g. coffee and frothed milk when making latte art), both of which were well beyond the scope of the current literature. To evaluate robot learning algorithms on understanding and interacting with such complex fluid systems, a comprehensive virtual platform with versatile simulation capabilities and well-established tasks is needed. In this work, we introduce FluidLab, a simulation environment with a diverse set of manipulation tasks involving complex fluid dynamics. These tasks address interactions between solid and fluid as well as among multiple fluids. At the heart of our platform is a fully differentiable physics simulator, FluidEngine, providing GPU-accelerated simulations and gradient calculations for various material types and their couplings, extending the scope of the existing differentiable simulation engines. We identify several challenges for fluid manipulation learning by evaluating a set of reinforcement learning and trajectory optimization methods on our platform. To address these challenges, we propose several domain-specific optimization schemes coupled with differentiable physics, which are empirically shown to be effective in tackling optimization problems featured by fluid system's non-convex and non-smooth properties.

Flow Matching is compatible with a general family of Gaussian probability paths for transforming between noise and data samples---which subsumes existing diffusion paths as specific instances. Interestingly, we find that employing FM with diffusion paths results in a more robust and stable alternative for training diffusion models. Furthermore, Flow Matching opens the door to training CNFs with other, non-diffusion probability paths. An instance of particular interest is using Optimal Transport (OT) displacement interpolation to define the conditional probability paths. These paths are more efficient than diffusion paths, provide faster training and sampling, and result in better generalization. Training CNFs using Flow Matching on ImageNet leads to consistently better performance than alternative diffusion-based methods in terms of both likelihood and sample quality, and allows fast and reliable sample generation using off-the-shelf numerical ODE solvers",

First, we empirically observe that different kinds of models for sequence modeling prefer data with different continuity. Then, we theoretically analyze the continuity preference of different models in both time and frequency domains. To further utilize continuity to improve sequence modeling, we propose a simple yet effective Lipschitz Regularizer, that can flexibly adjust data continuity according to model preferences, and bring very little extra computational cost.

In contrast with existing metrics, ROSCOE can measure semantic consistency, logicality, informativeness, fluency, and factuality — among other traits — by leveraging properties of step-by-step rationales. We empirically verify the strength of our metrics on five human annotated and six programmatically perturbed diagnostics datasets - covering a diverse set of tasks that require reasoning skills and show that ROSCOE can consistently outperform baseline metrics",

    "title": "Re-calibrating Feature Attributions for Model Interpretation",
    "volume": "spotlight",
    "abstract": "The ability to interpret machine learning models is critical for high-stakes applications. Due to its desirable theoretical properties, path integration is a widely used scheme for feature attribution to interpret model predictions. However, the methods implementing this scheme currently rely on absolute attribution scores to eventually provide sensible interpretations. This not only contradicts the premise that the features with larger attribution scores are more relevant to the model prediction, but also conflicts with the theoretical settings for which the desirable properties of the attributions are proven. We address this by devising a method to first compute an appropriate reference for the path integration scheme. This reference further helps in identifying valid interpolation points on a desired integration path. The reference is computed in a gradient ascending direction on the model's loss surface, while the interpolations are performed by analyzing the model gradients and variations between the reference and the input. The eventual integration is effectively performed along a non-linear path. Our scheme can be incorporated into the existing integral-based attribution methods. We also devise an effective sampling and integration procedure that enables employing our scheme with multi-reference path integration efficiently. We achieve a marked performance boost for a range of integral-based attribution methods on both local and global evaluation metrics by enhancing them with our scheme. Our extensive results also show improved sensitivity, sanity preservation and model robustness with the proposed re-calibration of the attribution techniques with our method",

    "title": "Adversarial Diversity in Hanabi",
    "volume": "spotlight",
    "abstract": "Many Dec-POMDPs admit a qualitatively diverse set of ''reasonable'' joint policies, where reasonableness is indicated by symmetry equivariance, non-sabotaging behaviour and the graceful degradation of performance when paired with ad-hoc partners. Some of the work in diversity literature is concerned with generating these policies. Unfortunately, existing methods fail to produce teams of agents that are simultaneously diverse, high performing, and reasonable. In this work, we propose a novel approach, adversarial diversity (ADVERSITY), which is designed for turn-based Dec-POMDPs with public actions. ADVERSITY relies on off-belief learning to encourage reasonableness and skill, and on ''repulsive'' fictitious transitions to encourage diversity. We use this approach to generate new agents with distinct but reasonable play styles for the card game Hanabi and open-source our agents to be used for future research on (ad-hoc) coordination",

    "title": "A Unified Algebraic Perspective on Lipschitz Neural Networks",
    "volume": "spotlight",
    "abstract": "Important research efforts have focused on the design and training of neural networks with a controlled Lipschitz constant. The goal is to increase and sometimes guarantee the robustness against adversarial attacks. Recent promising techniques draw inspirations from different backgrounds to design 1-Lipschitz neural networks, just to name a few: convex potential layers derive from the discretization of continuous dynamical systems, Almost-Orthogonal-Layer proposes a tailored method for matrix rescaling. However, it is today important to consider the recent and promising contributions in the field under a common theoretical lens to better design new and improved layers. This paper introduces a novel algebraic perspective unifying various types of 1-Lipschitz neural networks, including the ones previously mentioned, along with methods based on orthogonality and spectral methods. Interestingly, we show that many existing techniques can be derived and generalized via finding analytical solutions of a common semidefinite programming (SDP) condition. We also prove that AOL biases the scaled weight to the ones which are close to the set of orthogonal matrices in a certain mathematical manner. Moreover, our algebraic condition, combined with the Gershgorin circle theorem, readily leads to new and diverse parameterizations for 1-Lipschitz network layers. Our approach, called SDP-based Lipschitz Layers (SLL), allows us to design non-trivial yet efficient generalization of convex potential layers. Finally, the comprehensive set of experiments on image classification shows that SLLs outperform previous approaches on certified robust accuracy.

    "title": "The Influence of Learning Rule on Representation Dynamics in Wide Neural Networks",
    "volume": "spotlight",
    "abstract": "It is unclear how changing the learning rule of a deep neural network alters its learning dynamics and representations. To gain insight into the relationship between learned features, function approximation, and the learning rule, we analyze infinite-width deep networks trained with gradient descent (GD) and biologically-plausible alternatives including feedback alignment (FA), direct feedback alignment (DFA), and error modulated Hebbian learning (Hebb), as well as gated linear networks (GLN). We show that, for each of these learning rules, the evolution of the output function at infinite width is governed by a time varying effective neural tangent kernel (eNTK). In the lazy training limit, this eNTK is static and does not evolve, while in the rich mean-field regime this kernel's evolution can be determined self-consistently with dynamical mean field theory (DMFT). This DMFT enables comparisons of the feature and prediction dynamics induced by each of these learning rules. In the lazy limit, we find that DFA and Hebb can only learn using the last layer features, while full FA can utilize earlier layers with a scale determined by the initial correlation between feedforward and feedback weight matrices. In the rich regime, DFA and FA utilize a temporally evolving and depth-dependent NTK. Counterintuitively, we find that FA networks trained in the rich regime exhibit more feature learning if initialized with smaller correlation between the forward and backward pass weights. GLNs admit a very simple formula for their lazy limit kernel and preserve conditional Gaussianity of their preactivations under gating functions. Error modulated Hebb rules show very small task-relevant alignment of their kernels and perform most task relevant learning in the last layer",

    "abstract": "In this work, our objective is to adapt a Deep generative model trained on a large-scale source dataset to multiple target domains with scarce data. Specifically, we focus on adapting a pre-trained Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to a target domain without re-training the generator. Our method draws the motivation from the fact that out-of-distribution samples can be `embedded' onto the latent space of a pre-trained source-GAN. We propose to train a small latent-generation network during the inference stage, each time a batch of target samples is to be generated. These target latent codes are fed to the source-generator to obtain novel target samples. Despite using the same small set of target samples and the source generator, multiple independent training episodes of the latent-generation network results in the diversity of the generated target samples. Our method, albeit simple, can be used to generate data from multiple target distributions using a generator trained on a single source distribution.

    "title": "RLx2: Training a Sparse Deep Reinforcement Learning Model from Scratch",
    "volume": "spotlight",
    "abstract": "Training deep reinforcement learning (DRL) models usually requires high computation costs. Therefore, compressing DRL models possesses immense potential for training acceleration and model deployment. However, existing methods that generate small models mainly adopt the knowledge distillation-based approach by iteratively training a dense network. As a result, the training process still demands massive computing resources. Indeed, sparse training from scratch in DRL has not been well explored and is particularly challenging due to non-stationarity in bootstrap training. In this work, we propose a novel sparse DRL training framework, \"the Rigged Reinforcement Learning Lottery\" (RLx2), which builds upon gradient-based topology evolution and is capable of training a sparse DRL model based entirely on a sparse network. Specifically, RLx2 introduces a novel multi-step TD target mechanism with a dynamic-capacity replay buffer to achieve robust value learning and efficient topology exploration in sparse models. It also reaches state-of-the-art sparse training performance in several tasks, showing $7.5\\times$-$20\\times$ model compression with less than $3\\%$ performance degradation and up to $20\\times$ and $50\\times$ FLOPs reduction for training and inference, respectively",

    "title": "Sparsity May Cry: Let Us Fail (Current) Sparse Neural Networks Together!",
    "volume": "spotlight",
    "abstract": "Sparse Neural Networks (SNNs) have received voluminous attention predominantly due to growing computational and memory footprints of consistently exploding parameter count in large-scale models. Similar to their dense counterparts, recent SNNs generalize just as well and are equipped with numerous favorable benefits (e.g., low complexity, high scalability, and robustness), sometimes even better than the original dense networks. As research effort is focused on developing increasingly sophisticated sparse algorithms, it is startling that a comprehensive benchmark to evaluate the effectiveness of these algorithms has been highly overlooked. In absence of a carefully crafted evaluation benchmark, most if not all, sparse algorithms are evaluated against fairly simple and naive tasks (eg. CIFAR-10/100, ImageNet, GLUE, etc.), which can potentially camouflage many advantages as well unexpected predicaments of SNNs. In pursuit of a more general evaluation and unveiling the true potential of sparse algorithms, we introduce \"Sparsity May Cry\" Benchmark (SMC-Bench), a collection of carefully-curated 4 diverse tasks with 10 datasets, that accounts for capturing a wide range of domain-specific and sophisticated knowledge. Our systemic evaluation of the most representative sparse algorithms reveals an important obscured observation: the state-of-the-art magnitude- and/or gradient-based sparse algorithms seemingly fail to perform on SMC-Bench when applied out-of-the-box, sometimes at significantly trivial sparsity as low as 5%. The observations seek the immediate attention of the sparsity research community to reconsider the highly proclaimed benefits of SNNs. We further conduct a thorough investigation into the reasons for the failure of common SNNs. Our analysis points out that such failure is intimately related to the \"lazy regime\" of large model training, which hints us with stronger pruning recipes that alleviate the failure on SMC-Bench (though still more or less suffering). By incorporating these well-thought and diverse tasks, SMC-Bench is designed to favor and encourage the development of more scalable and generalizable sparse algorithms. We open-source SMC-Bench to assist researchers in building next-generation sparse algorithms that scale and generalize: https://github.com/VITA-Group/SMC-Bench",

    "volume": "spotlight",
    "abstract": "Despite their remarkable achievement, gigantic transformers encounter significant drawbacks, including exorbitant computational and memory footprints during training, as well as severe collapse evidenced by a high degree of parameter redundancy. Sparsely-activated Mixture-of-Experts (SMoEs) have shown promise to mitigate the issue of training efficiency, yet they are prone to (1) $\\textit{redundant experts}$ due to representational collapse; and (2) $\\textit{poor expert scalability for inference and downstream fine-tuning}$, primarily due to overfitting of the learned routing policy to the number of activated experts during training. As recent research efforts are predominantly focused on improving routing policies to encourage expert specializations, this work focuses on $\\textit{exploring the overlooked scalability bottleneck of SMoEs}$ and leveraging it to effectively $\\textbf{scale dense transformers}$. To this end, we propose a new plug-and-play training framework, $\\textbf{SMoE-Dropout}$, to enable scaling transformers to better accuracy in their full capacity without collapse. Specifically, SMoE-Dropout consists of a $\\textit{randomly initialized and fixed}$ router network to activate experts and gradually increases the activated expert number as training progresses over time. Transformers trained by SMoE-Dropout naturally exhibit a $\\textbf{``self-slimmable\"}$ property subject to resource availability, offering smooth and consistent performance boosts with an increase in activated experts during inference or fine-tuning. Our extensive experiments across diverse transformer architectures on a variety of tasks demonstrate the superior performance and substantial computation savings of SMoE-Dropout, compared to dense training baselines with equivalent parameter counts. In particular, our trained BERT outperforms its densely trained counterpart with consistent improvements of {$1.03\\%$, $0.78\\%$, $1.09\\%$} on challenging reasoning tasks {$\\texttt{ASDiv-A}$, $\\texttt{MAWPS}$, $\\texttt{SVAMP}$}, respectively.

    "abstract": "Monocular Depth Estimation (MDE) is a critical component in applications such as autonomous driving. There are various attacks against MDE networks. These attacks, especially the physical ones, pose a great threat to the security of such systems. Traditional adversarial training method requires ground-truth labels and hence cannot be directly applied to self-supervised MDE that does not have depth ground truth. Some self-supervised model hardening technique (e.g., contrastive learning) ignores the domain knowledge of MDE and can hardly achieve optimal performance. In this work, we propose a novel adversarial training method for self-supervised MDE models based on view synthesis without using the depth ground truth. We improve adversarial robustness against physical-world attacks using $L_0$-norm-bounded perturbation in training. We compare our method with supervised learning-based and contrastive learning-based methods that are tailored for MDE. Results on two representative MDE networks show that we achieve better robustness against various adversarial attacks with nearly no benign performance degradation",

    "title": "Sparsity-Constrained Optimal Transport",
    "volume": "spotlight",
    "abstract": "Regularized optimal transport (OT) is now increasingly used as a loss or as a matching layer in neural networks. Entropy-regularized OT can be computed using the Sinkhorn algorithm but it leads to fully-dense transportation plans, meaning that all sources are (fractionally) matched with all targets. To address this issue, several works have investigated quadratic regularization instead. This regularization preserves sparsity and leads to unconstrained and smooth (semi) dual objectives, that can be solved with off-the-shelf gradient methods. Unfortunately, quadratic regularization does not give direct control over the cardinality (number of nonzeros) of the transportation plan. We propose in this paper a new approach for OT with explicit cardinality constraints on the transportation plan. Our work is motivated by an application to sparse mixture of experts, where OT can be used to match input tokens such as image patches with expert models such as neural networks. Cardinality constraints ensure that at most $k$ tokens are matched with an expert, which is crucial for computational performance reasons. Despite the nonconvexity of cardinality constraints, we show that the corresponding (semi) dual problems are tractable and can be solved with first-order gradient methods. Our method can be thought as a middle ground between unregularized OT (recovered in the limit case $k=1$) and quadratically-regularized OT (recovered when $k$ is large enough). The smoothness of the objectives increases as $k$ increases, giving rise to a trade-off between convergence speed and sparsity of the optimal plan",

    "volume": "spotlight",
    "abstract": "Deep neural networks have witnessed huge successes in many challenging prediction tasks and yet they often suffer from out-of-distribution (OoD) samples, misclassifying them with high confidence. Recent advances show promising OoD detection performance for centralized training, and however, OoD detection in federated learning (FL) is largely overlooked, even though many security sensitive applications such as autonomous driving and voice recognition authorization are commonly trained using FL for data privacy concerns. The main challenge that prevents previous state-of-the-art OoD detection methods from being incorporated to FL is that they require large amount of real OoD samples. However, in real-world scenarios, such large-scale OoD training data can be costly or even infeasible to obtain, especially for resource-limited local devices. On the other hand, a notorious challenge in FL is data heterogeneity where each client collects non-identically and independently distributed (non-iid) data. We propose to take advantage of such heterogeneity and turn the curse into a blessing that facilitates OoD detection in FL. The key is that for each client, non-iid data from other clients (unseen external classes) can serve as an alternative to real OoD samples. Specifically, we propose a novel Federated Out-of-Distribution Synthesizer (FOSTER), which learns a class-conditional generator to synthesize virtual external-class OoD samples, and maintains data confidentiality and communication efficiency required by FL. Experimental results show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art by 2.49%, 2.88%, 1.42% AUROC, and 0.01%, 0.89%, 1.74% ID accuracy, on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and STL10, respectively",

    "abstract": "Real-world data generation often involves complex inter-dependencies among instances, violating the IID-data hypothesis of standard learning paradigms and posing a challenge for uncovering the geometric structures for learning desired instance representations. To this end, we introduce an energy constrained diffusion model which encodes a batch of instances from a dataset into evolutionary states that progressively incorporate other instances' information by their interactions. The diffusion process is constrained by descent criteria w.r.t. a principled energy function that characterizes the global consistency of instance representations over latent structures. We provide rigorous theory that implies closed-form optimal estimates for the pairwise diffusion strength among arbitrary instance pairs, which gives rise to a new class of neural encoders, dubbed as DIFFormer (diffusion-based Transformers), with two instantiations: a simple version with linear complexity for prohibitive instance numbers, and an advanced version for learning complex structures. Experiments highlight the wide applicability of our model as a general-purpose encoder backbone with superior performance in various tasks, such as node classification on large graphs, semi-supervised image/text classification, and spatial-temporal dynamics prediction.

    "abstract": "Population dynamics is the study of temporal and spatial variation in the size of populations of organisms and is a major part of population ecology. One of the main difficulties in analyzing population dynamics is that we can only obtain observation data with coarse time intervals from fixed-point observations due to experimental costs or measurement constraints. Recently, modeling population dynamics by using continuous normalizing flows (CNFs) and dynamic optimal transport has been proposed to infer the sample trajectories from a fixed-point observed population. While the sample behavior in CNFs is deterministic, the actual sample in biological systems moves in an essentially random yet directional manner. Moreover, when a sample moves from point A to point B in dynamical systems, its trajectory typically follows the principle of least action in which the corresponding action has the smallest possible value. To satisfy these requirements of the sample trajectories, we formulate the Lagrangian Schrödinger bridge (LSB) problem and propose to solve it approximately by modeling the advection-diffusion process with regularized neural SDE. We also develop a model architecture that enables faster computation of the loss function. Experimental results show that the proposed method can efficiently approximate the population-level dynamics even for high-dimensional data and that using the prior knowledge introduced by the Lagrangian enables us to estimate the sample-level dynamics with stochastic behavior",

This includes a guess-and-check optimizer that generates uniformly random parameter vectors until finding one that happens to achieve perfect train accuracy, and a zeroth-order Pattern Search optimizer that uses no gradient computations.

    "abstract": "There is a rising interest in further exploring the zero-shot learning potential of large pre-trained language models (PLMs). A new paradigm called data-generation-based zero-shot learning has achieved impressive success. In this paradigm, the synthesized data from the PLM acts as the carrier of knowledge, which is used to train a task-specific model with orders of magnitude fewer parameters than the PLM, achieving both higher performance and efficiency than prompt-based zero-shot learning methods on PLMs. The main hurdle of this approach is that the synthesized data from PLM usually contains a significant portion of low-quality samples. Fitting on such data will greatly hamper the performance of the task-specific model, making it unreliable for deployment. Previous methods remedy this issue mainly by filtering synthetic data using heuristic metrics(e.g., output confidence), or refining the data with the help of a human expert, which comes with excessive manual tuning or expensive costs. In this paper, we propose a novel noise-robust re-weighting framework SunGen to automatically construct high-quality data for zero-shot classification problems. Our framework features the ability to learn the sample weights indicating data quality without requiring any human annotation. We theoretically and empirically verify the ability of our method to help construct good-quality synthetic datasets.

First, in contrast to the conventional SCF loop, we propose to directly minimize the total energy by reparameterizing the orthogonal constraint as a feed-forward computation. We prove that such an approach has the same expressivity as the SCF method, yet reduces the computational complexity from O(N^4) to O(N^3). Second, the numerical integration which involves a summation over the quadrature grids can be amortized to the optimization steps. At each step, stochastic gradient descent (SGD) is performed with a sampled minibatch of the grids.

In this paper, we introduce WaRP, the \\textit{weight space rotation process}, which transforms the original parameter space into a new space so that we can push most of the previous knowledge compactly into only a few important parameters. By properly identifying and freezing these key parameters in the new weight space, we can finetune the remaining parameters without affecting the knowledge of previous classes.

Relying on the well-known link between denoising autoencoders and score-matching, we show that the denoising objective corresponds to learning a molecular force field -- arising from approximating the Boltzmann distribution with a mixture of Gaussians -- directly from equilibrium structures. Our experiments demonstrate that using this pre-training objective significantly improves performance on multiple benchmarks, achieving a new state-of-the-art on the majority of targets in the widely used QM9 dataset.

An ideal NP would learn everything from data without any inductive biases, but in practice, we often restrict the class of stochastic processes for the ease of estimation. One such restriction is the use of a finite-dimensional latent variable accounting for the uncertainty in the functions drawn from NPs. Some recent works show that this can be improved with more \"data-driven\" source of uncertainty such as bootstrapping. In this work, we take a different approach based on the martingale posterior, a recently developed alternative to Bayesian inference. For the martingale posterior, instead of specifying prior-likelihood pairs, a predictive distribution for future data is specified. Under specific conditions on the predictive distribution, it can be shown that the uncertainty in the generated future data actually corresponds to the uncertainty of the implicitly defined Bayesian posteriors. Based on this result, instead of assuming any form of the latent variables, we equip a NP with a predictive distribution implicitly defined with neural networks and use the corresponding martingale posteriors as the source of uncertainty.

Yet, there is a dearth of such metrics, which inhibits the rapid and efficient progress of language generators. One exception is the recently proposed Mauve. In theory, Mauve measures an information-theoretic divergence between two probability distributions over strings: one representing the language generator under evaluation; the other representing the true natural language distribution. Mauve's authors argue that its success comes from the qualitative properties of their proposed divergence. Yet in practice, as this divergence is uncomputable, Mauve approximates it by measuring the divergence between multinomial distributions over clusters instead, where cluster assignments are attained by grouping strings based on a pretrained language model's embeddings. As we show, however, this is not a tight approximation---in either theory or practice. This begs the question: why does Mauve work so well? In this work, we show that \\mauve was right for the wrong reasons, and that its newly proposed divergence is not necessary for its high performance. In fact, classical divergences paired with its proposed cluster-based approximation may actually serve as better evaluation metrics. We finish the paper with a probing analysis; this analysis leads us to conclude that---by encoding syntactic- and coherence-level features of text, while ignoring surface-level features---such cluster-based approximations to string distributions may simply be better for evaluating state-of-the-art language generators",

Furthermore, we propose a novel surrogate model specially designed for large joint search space, which proposes a Bezier curve-based model to predict learning curves with unlimited shape and length. Based on the proposed dataset, we new energy-aware AutoML method that arms existing AutoML algorithms to consider the search energy consumption, and our experiments show that the modified energy-aware AutoML methods achieve a better trade-off between energy consumption and model performance",

    "title": "MARS: Meta-learning as Score Matching in the Function Space",
    "volume": "spotlight",
    "abstract": "Meta-learning aims to extract useful inductive biases from a set of related datasets. In Bayesian meta-learning, this is typically achieved by constructing a prior distribution over neural network parameters. However, specifying families of computationally viable prior distributions over the high-dimensional neural network parameters is difficult. As a result, existing approaches resort to meta-learning restrictive diagonal Gaussian priors, severely limiting their expressiveness and performance. To circumvent these issues, we approach meta-learning through the lens of functional Bayesian neural network inference which views the prior as a stochastic process and performs inference in the function space. Specifically, we view the meta-training tasks as samples from the data-generating process and formalize meta-learning as empirically estimating the law of this stochastic process. Our approach can seamlessly acquire and represent complex prior knowledge by meta-learning the score function of the data-generating process marginals instead of parameter space priors. In a comprehensive benchmark, we demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of predictive accuracy and substantial improvements in the quality of uncertainty estimates",

    "title": "Faster Gradient-Free Methods for Escaping Saddle Points",
    "volume": "spotlight",
    "abstract": "Escaping from saddle points has become an important research topic in non-convex optimization. In this paper, we study the case when calculations of explicit gradients are expensive or even infeasible, and only function values are accessible. Currently, there have two types of gradient-free (zeroth-order) methods based on random perturbation and negative curvature finding proposed to escape saddle points efficiently and converge to an $\\epsilon$-approximate second-order stationary point. Nesterov's accelerated gradient descent (AGD) method can escape saddle points faster than gradient descent (GD) which have been verified in first-order algorithms. However, whether AGD could accelerate the gradient-free methods is still unstudied. To unfold this mystery, in this paper, we propose two accelerated variants for the two types of gradient-free methods of escaping saddle points. We show that our algorithms can find an $\\epsilon$-approximate second-order stationary point with $\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}(1/\\epsilon^{1.75})$ iteration complexity and $\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}(d/\\epsilon^{1.75})$ oracle complexity, where $d$ is the problem dimension. Thus, our methods achieve a comparable convergence rate to their first-order counterparts and have fewer oracle complexity compared to prior derivative-free methods for finding second-order stationary points",

    "title": "VA-DepthNet: A Variational Approach to Single Image Depth Prediction",
    "volume": "spotlight",
    "abstract": "We introduce VA-DepthNet, a simple, effective, and accurate deep neural network approach for the single-image depth prediction (SIDP) problem. The proposed approach advocates using classical first-order variational constraints for this problem. While state-of-the-art deep neural network methods for SIDP learn the scene depth from images in a supervised setting, they often overlook the invaluable invariances and priors in the rigid scene space, such as the regularity of the scene. The paper's main contribution is to reveal the benefit of classical and well-founded variational constraints in the neural network design for the SIDP task. It is shown that imposing first-order variational constraints in the scene space together with popular encoder-decoder-based network architecture design provides excellent results for the supervised SIDP task. The imposed first-order variational constraint makes the network aware of the depth gradient in the scene space, i.e., regularity. The paper demonstrates the usefulness of the proposed approach via extensive evaluation and ablation analysis over several benchmark datasets, such as KITTI, NYU Depth V2, and SUN RGB-D. The VA-DepthNet at test time shows considerable improvements in depth prediction accuracy compared to the prior art and is accurate also at high-frequency regions in the scene space. At the time of writing this paper, our method---labeled as VA-DepthNet, when tested on the KITTI depth-prediction evaluation set benchmarks, shows state-of-the-art results, and is the top-performing published approach",

    "title": "Prompt-to-Prompt Image Editing with Cross-Attention Control",
    "volume": "spotlight",
    "abstract": "Recent large-scale text-driven synthesis diffusion models have attracted much attention thanks to their remarkable capabilities of generating highly diverse images that follow given text prompts. Therefore, it is only natural to build upon these synthesis models to provide text-driven image editing capabilities. However, Editing is challenging for these generative models, since an innate property of an editing technique is to preserve some content from the original image, while in the text-based models, even a small modification of the text prompt often leads to a completely different outcome. State-of-the-art methods mitigate this by requiring the users to provide a spatial mask to localize the edit, hence, ignoring the original structure and content within the masked region. In this paper, we pursue an intuitive prompt-to-prompt editing framework, where the edits are controlled by text only. We analyze a text-conditioned model in depth and observe that the cross-attention layers are the key to controlling the relation between the spatial layout of the image to each word in the prompt. With this observation, we propose to control the attention maps along the diffusion process. Our approach enables us to monitor the synthesis process by editing the textual prompt only, paving the way to a myriad of caption-based editing applications such as localized editing by replacing a word, global editing by adding a specification, and even controlling the extent to which a word is reflected in the image. We present our results over diverse images and prompts with different text-to-image models, demonstrating high-quality synthesis and fidelity to the edited prompts",

    "abstract": "Image generation has recently seen tremendous advances, with diffusion models allowing to synthesize convincing images for a large variety of text prompts. In this article, we propose DiffEdit, a method to take advantage of text-conditioned diffusion models for the task of semantic image editing, where the goal is to edit an image based on a text query. Semantic image editing is an extension of image generation, with the additional constraint that the generated image should be as similar as possible to a given input image. Current editing methods based on diffusion models usually require to provide a mask, making the task much easier by treating it as a conditional inpainting task. In contrast, our main contribution is able to automatically generate a mask highlighting regions of the input image that need to be edited, by contrasting predictions of a diffusion model conditioned on different text prompts. Moreover, we rely on latent inference to preserve content in those regions of interest and show excellent synergies with mask-based diffusion. DiffEdit achieves state-of-the-art editing performance on ImageNet. In addition, we evaluate semantic image editing in more challenging settings, using images from the COCO dataset as well as text-based generated images",

    "volume": "spotlight",
    "abstract": "Evaluation metrics in image synthesis play a key role to measure performances of generative models. However, most metrics mainly focus on image fidelity. Existing diversity metrics are derived by comparing distributions, and thus they cannot quantify the diversity or rarity degree of each generated image. In this work, we propose a new evaluation metric, called `rarity score', to measure both image-wise uncommonness and model-wise diversified generation performance. We first show empirical observation that typical samples are close to each other and distinctive samples are far from each other in nearest-neighbor distances on latent spaces represented by feature extractor networks such as VGG16. We then show that one can effectively filter typical or distinctive samples with the proposed metric. We also use our metric to demonstrate that the extent to which different generative models produce rare images can be effectively compared. Further, our metric can be used to compare rarities between datasets that share the same concept such as CelebA-HQ and FFHQ. Finally, we analyze the use of metrics in different designs of feature extractors to better understand the relationship between feature spaces and resulting high-rarity images. Code will be publicly available for the research community",

    "title": "Corrupted Image Modeling for Self-Supervised Visual Pre-Training",

    "abstract": "We introduce Corrupted Image Modeling (CIM) for self-supervised visual pre-training. CIM uses an auxiliary generator with a small trainable BEiT to corrupt the input image instead of using artificial [MASK] tokens, where some patches are randomly selected and replaced with plausible alternatives sampled from the BEiT output distribution. Given this corrupted image, an enhancer network learns to either recover all the original image pixels, or predict whether each visual token is replaced by a generator sample or not. The generator and the enhancer are simultaneously trained and synergistically updated. After pre-training, the enhancer can be used as a high-capacity visual encoder for downstream tasks. CIM is a general and flexible visual pre-training framework that is suitable for various network architectures. For the first time, CIM demonstrates that both ViT and CNN can learn rich visual representations using a unified, non-Siamese framework. Experimental results show that our approach achieves compelling results in vision benchmarks, such as ImageNet classification and ADE20K semantic segmentation",

In this paper, we propose SIVI-SM, a new method for SIVI based on an alternative training objective via score matching. Leveraging the hierarchical structure of semi-implicit variational families, the score matching objective allows a minimax formulation where the intractable variational densities can be naturally handled with denoising score matching. We show that SIVI-SM closely matches the accuracy of MCMC and outperforms ELBO-based SIVI methods in a variety of Bayesian inference tasks",

    "title": "Exploring Temporally Dynamic Data Augmentation for Video Recognition",
    "volume": "spotlight",
    "abstract": "Data augmentation has recently emerged as an essential component of modern training recipes for visual recognition tasks. However, data augmentation for video recognition has been rarely explored despite its effectiveness. Few existing augmentation recipes for video recognition naively extend the image augmentation methods by applying the same operations to the whole video frames. Our main idea is that the magnitude of augmentation operations for each frame needs to be changed over time to capture the real-world video's temporal variations. These variations should be generated as diverse as possible using fewer additional hyper-parameters during training. Through this motivation, we propose a simple yet effective video data augmentation framework, DynaAugment. The magnitude of augmentation operations on each frame is changed by an effective mechanism, Fourier Sampling that parameterizes diverse, smooth, and realistic temporal variations. DynaAugment also includes an extended search space suitable for video for automatic data augmentation methods. DynaAugment experimentally demonstrates that there are additional performance rooms to be improved from static augmentations on diverse video models. Specifically, we show the effectiveness of DynaAugment on various video datasets and tasks: large-scale video recognition (Kinetics-400 and Something-Something-v2), small-scale video recognition (UCF-101 and HMDB-51), fine-grained video recognition (Diving-48 and FineGym), video action segmentation on Breakfast, video action localization on THUMOS'14, and video object detection on MOT17Det",

    "volume": "spotlight",
    "abstract": "Modern quantum annealers can find high-quality solutions to combinatorial optimisation objectives given as quadratic unconstrained binary optimisation (QUBO) problems. Unfortunately, obtaining suitable QUBO forms in computer vision remains challenging and currently requires problem-specific analytical derivations. Moreover, such explicit formulations impose tangible constraints on solution encodings. In stark contrast to prior work, this paper proposes to learn QUBO forms from data through gradient backpropagation instead of deriving them. As a result, the solution encodings can be chosen flexibly and compactly. Furthermore, our methodology is general and virtually independent of the specifics of the target problem type. We demonstrate the advantages of learnt QUBOs on the diverse problem types of graph matching, 2D point cloud alignment and 3D rotation estimation. Our results are competitive with the previous quantum state of the art while requiring much fewer logical and physical qubits, enabling our method to scale to larger problems.

    "title": "Towards Effective and Interpretable Human-Agent Collaboration in MOBA Games: A Communication Perspective",
    "volume": "spotlight",
    "abstract": "MOBA games, e.g., Dota2 and Honor of Kings, have been actively used as the testbed for the recent AI research on games, and various AI systems have been developed at the human level so far. However, these AI systems mainly focus on how to compete with humans, less on exploring how to collaborate with humans. To this end, this paper makes the first attempt to investigate human-agent collaboration in MOBA games. In this paper, we propose to enable humans and agents to collaborate through explicit communication by designing an efficient and interpretable Meta-Command Communication-based framework, dubbed MCC, for accomplishing effective human-agent collaboration in MOBA games. The MCC framework consists of two pivotal modules: 1) an interpretable communication protocol, i.e., the Meta-Command, to bridge the communication gap between humans and agents; 2) a meta-command value estimator, i.e., the Meta-Command Selector, to select a valuable meta-command for each agent to achieve effective human-agent collaboration. Experimental results in Honor of Kings demonstrate that MCC agents can collaborate reasonably well with human teammates and even generalize to collaborate with different levels and numbers of human teammates.

    "volume": "spotlight",
    "abstract": "We consider sketching algorithms which first compress data by multiplication with a random sketch matrix, and then apply the sketch to quickly solve an optimization problem, e.g., low-rank approximation and regression. In the learning-based sketching paradigm proposed by Indyk et al., the sketch matrix is found by choosing a random sparse matrix, e.g., CountSketch, and then the values of its non-zero entries are updated by running gradient descent on a training data set. Despite the growing body of work on this paradigm, a noticeable omission is that the locations of the non-zero entries of previous algorithms were fixed, and only their values were learned. In this work, we propose the first learning-based algorithms that also optimize the locations of the non-zero entries. Our first proposed algorithm is based on a greedy algorithm. However, one drawback of the greedy algorithm is its slower training time. We fix this issue and propose approaches for learning a sketching matrix for both low-rank approximation and Hessian approximation for second-order optimization. The latter is helpful for a range of constrained optimization problems, such as LASSO and matrix estimation with a nuclear norm constraint. Both approaches achieve good accuracy with a fast running time. Moreover, our experiments suggest that our algorithm can still reduce the error significantly even if we only have a very limited number of training matrices",

    "abstract": "Estimating the 3DoF rotation from a single RGB image is an important yet challenging problem. Probabilistic rotation regression has raised more and more attention with the benefit of expressing uncertainty information along with the prediction. Though modeling noise using Gaussian-resembling Bingham distribution and matrix Fisher distribution is natural, they are shown to be sensitive to outliers for the nature of quadratic punishment to deviations. In this paper, we draw inspiration from multivariate Laplace distribution and propose a novel Rotation Laplace distribution on SO(3). Rotation Laplace distribution is robust to the disturbance of outliers and enforces much gradient to the low-error region, resulting in a better convergence. Our extensive experiments show that our proposed distribution achieves state-of-the-art performance for rotation regression tasks over both probabilistic and non-probabilistic baselines.

    "title": "HiViT: A Simpler and More Efficient Design of Hierarchical Vision Transformer",
    "volume": "spotlight",
    "abstract": "There has been a debate on the choice of plain vs. hierarchical vision transformers, where researchers often believe that the former (e.g., ViT) has a simpler design but the latter (e.g., Swin) enjoys higher recognition accuracy. Recently, the emerge of masked image modeling (MIM), a self-supervised visual pre-training method, raised a new challenge to vision transformers in terms of flexibility, i.e., part of image patches or tokens are to be discarded, which seems to claim the advantages of plain vision transformers. In this paper, we delve deep into the comparison between ViT and Swin, revealing that (i) the performance gain of Swin is mainly brought by a deepened backbone and relative positional encoding, (ii) the hierarchical design of Swin can be simplified into hierarchical patch embedding (proposed in this work), and (iii) other designs such as shifted-window attentions can be removed. By removing the unnecessary operations, we come up with a new architecture named HiViT (short for hierarchical ViT), which is simpler and more efficient than Swin yet further improves its performance on fully-supervised and self-supervised visual representation learning. In particular, after pre-trained using masked autoencoder (MAE) on ImageNet-1K, HiViT-B reports a 84.6% accuracy on ImageNet-1K classification, a 53.3% box AP on COCO detection, and a 52.8% mIoU on ADE20K segmentation, significantly surpassing the baseline.

    "title": "A Minimalist Dataset for Systematic Generalization of Perception, Syntax, and Semantics",
    "volume": "spotlight",
    "abstract": "Inspired by humans' exceptional ability to master arithmetic and generalize to new problems, we present a new dataset, HINT, to examine machines' capability of learning generalizable concepts at three levels: perception, syntax, and semantics. In HINT, machines are tasked with learning how concepts are perceived from raw signals such as images (i.e., perception), how multiple concepts are structurally combined to form a valid expression (i.e., syntax), and how concepts are realized to afford various reasoning tasks (i.e., semantics), all in a weakly supervised manner. Focusing on systematic generalization, we carefully design a five-fold test set to evaluate both the interpolation and the extrapolation of learned concepts w.r.t the three levels. Further, we design a few-shot learning split to determine whether or not models can rapidly learn new concepts and generalize them to more complex scenarios. To comprehend existing models' limitations, we undertake extensive experiments with various sequence-to-sequence models, including RNNs, Transformers, and GPT-3 (with the chain of thought prompting). The results indicate that current models struggle to extrapolate to long-range syntactic dependency and semantics. Models exhibit a considerable gap toward human-level generalization when evaluated with new concepts in a few-shot setting. Moreover, we discover that it is infeasible to solve HINT by merely scaling up the dataset and the model size; this strategy contributes little to the extrapolation of syntax and semantics. Finally, in zero-shot GPT-3 experiments, the chain of thought prompting exhibits impressive results and significantly boosts the test accuracy. We believe the HINT dataset and the experimental findings are of great interest to the learning community on systematic generalization.%",

    "abstract": "Anomaly detection in time-series has a wide range of practical applications. While numerous anomaly detection methods have been proposed in the literature, a recent survey concluded that no single method is the most accurate across various datasets. To make matters worse, anomaly labels are scarce and rarely available in practice. The practical problem of selecting the most accurate model for a given dataset without labels has received little attention in the literature. This paper answers this question \\textit{i.e.} Given an unlabeled dataset and a set of candidate anomaly detectors, how can we select the most accurate model? To this end, we identify three classes of surrogate (unsupervised) metrics, namely, \\textit{prediction error}, \\textit{model centrality}, and \\textit{performance on injected synthetic anomalies}, and show that some metrics are highly correlated with standard supervised anomaly detection performance metrics such as the $F_1$ score, but to varying degrees. We formulate metric combination with multiple imperfect surrogate metrics as a robust rank aggregation problem. We then provide theoretical justification behind the proposed approach. Large-scale experiments on multiple real-world datasets demonstrate that our proposed unsupervised approach is as effective as selecting the most accurate model based on partially labeled data",

We leverage grouped convolutions to parallelize the ensemble into a single shared backbone and forward pass to improve training and inference speeds. PE is designed to operate within the memory limits of a standard neural network.

However, it is non-trivial to learn the optimal moment among many possible moments of starting translating, as the moments of starting translating always hide inside the model and can only be supervised with the observed target sequence. In this paper, we propose a Hidden Markov Transformer (HMT), which treats the moments of starting translating as hidden events and the target sequence as the corresponding observed events, thereby organizing them as a hidden Markov model. HMT explicitly models multiple moments of starting translating as the candidate hidden events, and then selects one to generate the target token. During training, by maximizing the marginal likelihood of the target sequence over multiple moments of starting translating, HMT learns to start translating at the moments that target tokens can be generated more accurately. Experiments on multiple SiMT benchmarks show that HMT outperforms strong baselines and achieves state-of-the-art performance",

However, such domain indices are not always available. To address this challenge, we first provide a formal definition of domain index from the probabilistic perspective, and then propose an adversarial variational Bayesian framework that infers domain indices from multi-domain data, thereby providing additional insight on domain relations and improving domain adaptation performance. Our theoretical analysis shows that our adversarial variational Bayesian framework finds the optimal domain index at equilibrium. Empirical results on both synthetic and real data verify that our model can produce interpretable domain indices which enable us to achieve superior performance compared to state-of-the-art domain adaptation methods.

    "abstract": "Unlearnable examples (ULEs) aim to protect data from unauthorized usage for training DNNs. Existing work adds $\\ell_\\infty$-bounded perturbations to the original sample so that the trained model generalizes poorly. Such perturbations, however, are easy to eliminate by adversarial training and data augmentations. In this paper, we resolve this problem from a novel perspective by perturbing only one pixel in each image. Interestingly, such a small modification could effectively degrade model accuracy to almost an untrained counterpart. Moreover, our produced \\emph{One-Pixel Shortcut (OPS)} could not be erased by adversarial training and strong augmentations. To generate OPS, we perturb in-class images at the same position to the same target value that could mostly and stably deviate from all the original images. Since such generation is only based on images, OPS needs significantly less computation cost than the previous methods using DNN generators. Based on OPS, we introduce an unlearnable dataset called CIFAR-10-S, which is indistinguishable from CIFAR-10 by humans but induces the trained model to extremely low accuracy. Even under adversarial training, a ResNet-18 trained on CIFAR-10-S has only 10.61% accuracy, compared to 83.02% by the existing error-minimizing method",

    "title": "Deterministic training of generative autoencoders using invertible layers",
    "volume": "spotlight",
    "abstract": "In this work, we provide a deterministic alternative to the stochastic variational training of generative autoencoders. We refer to these new generative autoencoders as AutoEncoders within Flows (AEF), since the encoder and decoder are defined as affine layers of an overall invertible architecture. This results in a deterministic encoding of the data, as opposed to the stochastic encoding of VAEs. The paper introduces two related families of AEFs. The first family relies on a partition of the ambient space and is trained by exact maximum-likelihood. The second family exploits a deterministic expansion of the ambient space and is trained by maximizing the log-probability in this extended space. This latter case leaves complete freedom in the choice of encoder, decoder and prior architectures, making it a drop-in replacement for the training of existing VAEs and VAE-style models. We show that these AEFs can have strikingly higher performance than architecturally identical VAEs in terms of log-likelihood and sample quality, especially for low dimensional latent spaces. Importantly, we show that AEF samples are substantially sharper than VAE samples",

    "volume": "spotlight",
    "abstract": "In this paper, we explore learning statistically consistent classifiers under label noise by estimating the noise transition matrix T. We first provide a holistic view of existing T-estimation methods including those with or without anchor point assumptions. We unified them into the Minimum Geometric Envelope Operator (MGEO) framework, which tries to find the smallest T (in terms of a certain metric) that elicits a convex hull to enclose the posteriors of all the training data. Although MGEO methods show appealing theoretical properties and empirical results, we find them prone to failing when the noisy posterior estimation is imperfect, which is inevitable in practice. Specifically, we show that MGEO methods are in-consistent even with infinite samples if the noisy posterior is not estimated accurately. In view of this, we make the first effort to address this issue by proposing a novel T-estimation framework via the lens of bilevel optimization, and term it RObust Bilevel OpTimzation (ROBOT). ROBOT paves a new road beyond MGEO framework, which enjoys strong theoretical properties: identifibility, consistency and finite-sample generalization guarantees. Notably, ROBOT neither requires the perfect posterior estimation nor assumes the existence of anchor points. We further theoretically demonstrate that ROBOT is more robust in the case where MGEO methods fail. Experimentally, our framework also shows superior performance across multiple benchmarks",

    "abstract": "Active domain adaptation (DA) aims to maximally boost the model adaptation on a new target domain by actively selecting limited target data to annotate, whereas traditional active learning methods may be less effective since they do not consider the domain shift issue. Despite active DA methods address this by further proposing targetness to measure the representativeness of target domain characteristics, their predictive uncertainty is usually based on the prediction of deterministic models, which can easily be miscalibrated on data with distribution shift. Considering this, we propose a Dirichlet-based Uncertainty Calibration (DUC) approach for active DA, which simultaneously achieves the mitigation of miscalibration and the selection of informative target samples. Specifically, we place a Dirichlet prior on the prediction and interpret the prediction as a distribution on the probability simplex, rather than a point estimate like deterministic models. This manner enables us to consider all possible predictions, mitigating the miscalibration of unilateral prediction. Then a two-round selection strategy based on different uncertainty origins is designed to select target samples that are both representative of target domain and conducive to discriminability. Extensive experiments on cross-domain image classification and semantic segmentation validate the superiority of DUC",

We show that the feature space that FID is (typically) computed in is so close to the ImageNet classifications that aligning the histograms of Top-$N$ classifications between sets of generated and real images can reduce FID substantially — without actually improving the quality of results. Thus, we conclude that FID is prone to intentional or accidental distortions.

    "volume": "spotlight",
    "abstract": "Deep regression networks are widely used to tackle the problem of predicting a continuous value for a given input. Task-specialized approaches for training regression networks have shown significant improvement over generic approaches, such as direct regression. More recently, a generic approach based on regression by binary classification using binary-encoded labels has shown significant improvement over direct regression. The space of label encodings for regression is large. Lacking heretofore have been automated approaches to find a good label encoding for a given application. This paper introduces Regularized Label Encoding Learning (RLEL) for end-to-end training of an entire network and its label encoding. RLEL provides a generic approach for tackling regression. Underlying RLEL is our observation that the search space of label encodings can be constrained and efficiently explored by using a continuous search space of real-valued label encodings combined with a regularization function designed to encourage encodings with certain properties. These properties balance the probability of classification error in individual bits against error correction capability. Label encodings found by RLEL result in lower or comparable errors to manually designed label encodings. Applying RLEL results in $10.9\\%$ and $12.4\\%$ improvement in Mean Absolute Error (MAE) over direct regression and multiclass classification, respectively. Our evaluation demonstrates that RLEL can be combined with off-the-shelf feature extractors and is suitable across different architectures, datasets, and tasks.

To tackle the entire task, prior work chains multiple stationary manipulation skills with a point-goal navigation skill, which are learned individually on subtasks. Although more effective than monolithic end-to-end RL policies, this framework suffers from compounding errors in skill chaining, e.g., navigating to a bad location where a stationary manipulation skill can not reach its target to manipulate. To this end, we propose that the manipulation skills should include mobility to have flexibility in interacting with the target object from multiple locations and at the same time the navigation skill could have multiple end points which lead to successful manipulation. We operationalize these ideas by implementing mobile manipulation skills rather than stationary ones and training a navigation skill trained with region goal instead of point goal. We evaluate our multi-skill mobile manipulation method M3 on 3 challenging long-horizon mobile manipulation tasks in the Home Assistant Benchmark (HAB), and show superior performance as compared to the baselines",

FLoRA enables single-shot FL-HPO: identifying a single set of good hyper-parameters that are subsequently used in a single FL training. Thus, it enables FL-HPO solutions with minimal additional communication overhead compared to FL training without HPO. Utilizing standard smoothness assumptions, we theoretically characterize the optimality gap of FLoRA for any convex and non-convex loss functions, which explicitly accounts for the heterogeneous nature of the parties' local data distributions, a dominant characteristic of FL systems. Our empirical evaluation of FLoRA for multiple FL algorithms on seven OpenML datasets demonstrates significant model accuracy improvements over the baselines, and robustness to increasing number of parties involved in FL-HPO training",

Unlike recently advanced variants that incorporate vision-specific inductive biases into their architectures, the plain ViT suffers inferior performance on dense predictions due to weak prior assumptions. To address this issue, we propose the ViT-Adapter, which allows plain ViT to achieve comparable performance to vision-specific transformers. Specifically, the backbone in our framework is a plain ViT that can learn powerful representations from large-scale multi-modal data. When transferring to downstream tasks, a pre-training-free adapter is used to introduce the image-related inductive biases into the model, making it suitable for these tasks. We verify ViT-Adapter on multiple dense prediction tasks, including object detection, instance segmentation, and semantic segmentation. Notably, without using extra detection data, our ViT-Adapter-L yields state-of-the-art 60.9 box AP and 53.0 mask AP on COCO test-dev.

    "title": "Divide to Adapt: Mitigating Confirmation Bias for Domain Adaptation of Black-Box Predictors",
    "volume": "spotlight",
    "abstract": "Domain Adaptation of Black-box Predictors (DABP) aims to learn a model on an unlabeled target domain supervised by a black-box predictor trained on a source domain. It does not require access to both the source-domain data and the predictor parameters, thus addressing the data privacy and portability issues of standard domain adaptation methods. Existing DABP approaches mostly rely on knowledge distillation (KD) from the black-box predictor, i.e., training the model with its noisy target-domain predictions, which however inevitably introduces the confirmation bias accumulated from the prediction noises and leads to degrading performance. To mitigate such bias, we propose a new strategy, \\textit{divide-to-adapt}, that purifies cross-domain knowledge distillation by proper domain division. This is inspired by an observation we make for the first time in domain adaptation: the target domain usually contains easy-to-adapt and hard-to-adapt samples that have different levels of domain discrepancy w.r.t. the source domain, and deep models tend to fit easy-to-adapt samples first. Leveraging easy-to-adapt samples with less noise can help KD alleviate the negative effect of prediction noises from black-box predictors. In this sense, the target domain can be divided into an easy-to-adapt subdomain with less noise and a hard-to-adapt subdomain at the early stage of training. Then the adaptation is achieved by semi-supervised learning. We further reduce distribution discrepancy between subdomains and develop weak-strong augmentation strategy to filter the predictor errors progressively. As such, our method is a simple yet effective solution to reduce error accumulation in cross-domain knowledge distillation for DABP. Moreover, we prove that the target error of DABP is bounded by the noise ratio of two subdomains, i.e., the confirmation bias, which provides the theoretical justifications for our method. Extensive experiments demonstrate our method achieves state of the art on all DABP benchmarks, outperforming the existing best approach by 7.0\\% on VisDA-17, and is even comparable with the standard domain adaptation methods that use the source-domain data",

Unlike conventional methods of only learning one single prompt, we propose to learn multiple comprehensive prompts to describe diverse characteristics of categories such as intrinsic attributes or extrinsic contexts. However, directly matching each prompt to the same visual feature is problematic, as it pushes the prompts to converge to one point. To solve this problem, we propose to apply optimal transport to match the vision and text modalities. Specifically, we first model images and the categories with visual and textual feature sets. Then, we apply a two-stage optimization strategy to learn the prompts. In the inner loop, we optimize the optimal transport distance to align visual features and prompts by the Sinkhorn algorithm, while in the outer loop, we learn the prompts by this distance from the supervised data.

    "title": "LAVA: Data Valuation without Pre-Specified Learning Algorithms",
    "volume": "spotlight",
    "abstract": "Traditionally, data valuation is posed as a problem of equitably splitting the validation performance of a learning algorithm among the training data. As a result, the calculated data values depend on many design choices of the underlying learning algorithm. However, this dependence is undesirable for many use cases of data valuation, such as setting priorities over different data sources in a data acquisition process and informing pricing mechanisms in a data marketplace. In these scenarios, data needs to be valued before the actual analysis and the choice of the learning algorithm is still undetermined then. Another side-effect of the dependence is that to assess the value of individual points, one needs to re-run the learning algorithm with and without a point, which incurs a large computation burden. This work leapfrogs over the current limits of data valuation methods by introducing a new framework that can value training data in a way that is oblivious to the downstream learning algorithm. Our main results are as follows. $\\textbf{(1)}$ We develop a proxy for the validation performance associated with a training set based on a non-conventional $\\textit{class-wise}$ $\\textit{Wasserstein distance}$ between the training and the validation set. We show that the distance characterizes the upper bound of the validation performance for any given model under certain Lipschitz conditions. $\\textbf{(2)}$ We develop a novel method to value individual data based on the sensitivity analysis of the $\\textit{class-wise}$ Wasserstein distance. Importantly, these values can be directly obtained $\\textit{for free}$ from the output of off-the-shelf optimization solvers once the Wasserstein distance is computed. $\\textbf{(3) }$We evaluate our new data valuation framework over various use cases related to detecting low-quality data and show that, surprisingly, the learning-agnostic feature of our framework enables a $\\textit{significant improvement}$ over the state-of-the-art performance while being $\\textit{orders of magnitude faster.}$",

However, recent state-of-the-art neural decoders suffer from high complexity and lack the important iterative scheme characteristic of many legacy decoders. In this work, we propose to employ denoising diffusion models for the soft decoding of linear codes at arbitrary block lengths. Our framework models the forward channel corruption as a series of diffusion steps that can be reversed iteratively. Three contributions are made: (i) a diffusion process suitable for the decoding setting is introduced, (ii) the neural diffusion decoder is conditioned on the number of parity errors, which indicates the level of corruption at a given step, (iii) a line search procedure based on the code's syndrome obtains the optimal reverse diffusion step size. The proposed approach demonstrates the power of diffusion models for ECC and is able to achieve state-of-the-art accuracy, outperforming the other neural decoders by sizable margins, even for a single reverse diffusion step",

    "title": "Neuro-Symbolic Procedural Planning with Commonsense Prompting",
    "volume": "spotlight",
    "abstract": "Procedural planning aims to implement complex high-level goals by decomposition into simpler low-level steps. Although procedural planning is a basic skill set for humans in daily life, it remains a challenge for large language models (LLMs) that lack a deep understanding of the cause-effect relations in procedures. Previous methods require manual exemplars to acquire procedural planning knowledge from LLMs in the zero-shot setting. However, such elicited pre-trained knowledge in LLMs induces spurious correlations between goals and steps, which impair the model generalization to unseen tasks. In contrast, this paper proposes a neuro-symbolic procedural PLANner (PLAN) that elicits procedural planning knowledge from the LLMs with commonsense-infused prompting. To mitigate spurious goal-step correlations, we use symbolic program executors on the latent procedural representations to formalize prompts from commonsense knowledge bases as a causal intervention toward the Structural Causal Model. Both automatic and human evaluations on WikiHow and RobotHow show the superiority of PLAN on procedural planning without further training or manual exemplars",

    "title": "Generative Augmented Flow Networks",
    "volume": "spotlight",
    "abstract": "The Generative Flow Network is a probabilistic framework where an agent learns a stochastic policy for object generation, such that the probability of generating an object is proportional to a given reward function. Its effectiveness has been shown in discovering high-quality and diverse solutions, compared to reward-maximizing reinforcement learning-based methods. Nonetheless, GFlowNets only learn from rewards of the terminal states, which can limit its applicability. Indeed, intermediate rewards play a critical role in learning, for example from intrinsic motivation to provide intermediate feedback even in particularly challenging sparse reward tasks. Inspired by this, we propose Generative Augmented Flow Networks (GAFlowNets), a novel learning framework to incorporate intermediate rewards into GFlowNets. We specify intermediate rewards by intrinsic motivation to tackle the exploration problem in sparse reward environments. GAFlowNets can leverage edge-based and state-based intrinsic rewards in a joint way to improve exploration. Based on extensive experiments on the GridWorld task, we demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of GAFlowNet in terms of convergence, performance, and diversity of solutions. We further show that GAFlowNet is scalable to a more complex and large-scale molecule generation domain, where it achieves consistent and significant performance improvement",

    "title": "The Trade-off between Universality and Label Efficiency of Representations from Contrastive Learning",
    "volume": "spotlight",
    "abstract": "Pre-training representations (a.k.a. foundation models) has recently become a prevalent learning paradigm, where one first pre-trains a representation using large-scale unlabeled data, and then learns simple predictors on top of the representation using small labeled data from the downstream tasks. There are two key desiderata for the representation: label efficiency (the ability to learn an accurate classifier on top of the representation with a small amount of labeled data) and universality (usefulness across a wide range of downstream tasks). In this paper, we focus on one of the most popular instantiations of this paradigm: contrastive learning with linear probing, i.e., learning a linear predictor on the representation pre-trained by contrastive learning. We show that there exists a trade-off between the two desiderata so that one may not be able to achieve both simultaneously. Specifically, we provide analysis using a theoretical data model and show that, while more diverse pre-training data result in more diverse features for different tasks (improving universality), it puts less emphasis on task-specific features, giving rise to larger sample complexity for down-stream supervised tasks, and thus worse prediction performance. Guided by this analysis, we propose a contrastive regularization method to improve the trade-off. We validate our analysis and method empirically with systematic experiments using real-world datasets and foundation models",

    "abstract": "The long runtime of high-fidelity partial differential equation (PDE) solvers makes them unsuitable for time-critical applications. We propose to accelerate PDE solvers using reduced-order modeling (ROM). Whereas prior ROM approaches reduce the dimensionality of discretized vector fields, our continuous reduced-order modeling (CROM) approach builds a low-dimensional embedding of the continuous vector fields themselves, not their discretization. We represent this reduced manifold using continuously differentiable neural fields, which may train on any and all available numerical solutions of the continuous system, even when they are obtained using diverse methods or discretizations. We validate our approach on an extensive range of PDEs with training data from voxel grids, meshes, and point clouds. Compared to prior discretization-dependent ROM methods, such as linear subspace proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) and nonlinear manifold neural-network-based autoencoders, CROM features higher accuracy, lower memory consumption, dynamically adaptive resolutions, and applicability to any discretization. For equal latent space dimension, CROM exhibits 79$\\times$ and 49$\\times$ better accuracy, and 39$\\times$ and 132$\\times$ smaller memory footprint, than POD and autoencoder methods, respectively.

    "abstract": "We investigate how multimodal prompt engineering can use language as the intermediate representation to combine complementary knowledge from different pretrained (potentially multimodal) language models for a variety of tasks. This approach is both distinct from and complementary to the dominant paradigm of joint multimodal training. It also recalls a traditional systems-building view as in classical NLP pipelines, but with prompting large pretrained multimodal models. We refer to these as Socratic Models (SMs): a modular class of systems in which multiple pretrained models may be composed zero-shot via multimodal-informed prompting to capture new multimodal capabilities, without additional finetuning. We show that these systems provide competitive state-of-the-art performance for zero-shot image captioning and video-to-text retrieval, and also enable new applications such as (i) answering free-form questions about egocentric video, (ii) engaging in multimodal assistive dialogue with people (e.g., for cooking recipes), and (iii) robot perception and planning. We hope this work provides (a) results for stronger zero-shot baseline performance with analysis also highlighting their limitations, (b) new perspectives for building multimodal systems powered by large pretrained models, and (c) practical application advantages in certain regimes limited by data scarcity, training compute, or model access",

TabPFN is a Prior-Data Fitted Network (PFN) and is trained offline once, to approximate Bayesian inference on synthetic datasets drawn from our prior. This prior incorporates ideas from causal reasoning: It entails a large space of structural causal models with a preference for simple structures. On the $18$ datasets in the OpenML-CC18 suite that contain up to 1000 training data points, up to 100 purely numerical features without missing values, and up to 10 classes, we show that our method clearly outperforms boosted trees and performs on par with complex state-of-the-art AutoML systems with up to $230\\times$ speedup.

    "title": "Human Motion Diffusion Model",
    "volume": "spotlight",
    "abstract": "Natural and expressive human motion generation is the holy grail of computer animation. It is a challenging task, due to the diversity of possible motion, human perceptual sensitivity to it, and the difficulty of accurately describing it. Therefore, current generative solutions are either low-quality or limited in expressiveness. Diffusion models are promising candidates for the human motion domain since they have already shown remarkable generative capabilities in other domains, and their many-to-many nature. In this paper, we introduce Motion Diffusion Model (MDM), a carefully adapted classifier-free diffusion-based generative model for human motion data. MDM is transformer-based, combining insights from motion generation literature. A notable design-choice is that it predicts the sample itself rather than the noise in each step to facilitate the use of established geometric losses on the locations and velocities of the motion, such as the foot contact loss. As we demonstrate, MDM is a generic approach, enabling different modes of conditioning, and different generation tasks. We show that our model is trained with lightweight resources and yet achieves state-of-the-art results on leading benchmarks for text-to-motion, action-to-motion, and unconditioned motion generation",

    "volume": "spotlight",
    "abstract": "We devise deep nearest centroids (DNC), a conceptually elegant yet surprisingly effective network for large-scale visual recognition, by revisiting Nearest Centroids, one of the most classic and simple classifiers. Current deep models learn the classifier in a fully parametric manner, ignoring the latent data structure and lacking simplicity and explainability. DNC instead conducts nonparametric, case-based reasoning; it utilizes sub-centroids of training samples to describe class distributions and clearly explains the classification as the proximity of test data and the class sub-centroids in the feature space. Due to the distance-based nature, the network output dimensionality is flexible, and all the learnable parameters are only for data embedding. That means all the knowledge learnt for ImageNet classification can be completely transferred for pixel recognition learning, under the ‘pre-training and fine-tuning' paradigm. Apart from its nested simplicity and intuitive decision-making mechanism, DNC can even possess ad-hoc explainability when the sub-centroids are selected as actual training images that humans can view and inspect. Compared with parametric counterparts, DNC performs better on image classification (CIFAR-10, ImageNet) and greatly boots pixel recognition (ADE20K, Cityscapes), with improved transparency and fewer learnable parameters, using various network architectures (ResNet, Swin) and segmentation models (FCN, DeepLabV3, Swin).

This is achieved by embedding spatial observations independently of their discretization via Implicit Neural Representations in a small latent space temporally driven by a learned ODE. This separate and flexible treatment of time and space makes DINo the first data-driven model to combine the following advantages. It extrapolates at arbitrary spatial and temporal locations; it can learn from sparse irregular grids or manifolds; at test time, it generalizes to new grids or resolutions.

These two seemingly contradictory properties impose a trade-off between improving the model's generalization and maintaining its performance on the original task. Models trained with self-supervised learning tend to generalize better than their supervised counterparts for transfer learning; yet, they still lag behind supervised models on IN1K. In this paper, we propose a supervised learning setup that leverages the best of both worlds. We extensively analyze supervised training using multi-scale crops for data augmentation and an expendable projector head, and reveal that the design of the projector allows us to control the trade-off between performance on the training task and transferability. We further replace the last layer of class weights with class prototypes computed on the fly using a memory bank and derive two models: t-ReX that achieves a new state of the art for transfer learning and outperforms top methods such as DINO and PAWS on IN1K, and t-ReX* that matches the highly optimized RSB-A1 model on IN1K while performing better on transfer tasks.

Utilizing differentiable rendering, recent 3D-aware generative models have shown impressive results of rigid object generation using 2D images. However, it remains challenging to generate articulated objects, like human bodies, due to their complexity and diversity in poses and appearances. In this work, we propose, EVA3D, an unconditional 3D human generative model learned from 2D image collections only. EVA3D can sample 3D humans with detailed geometry and render high-quality images (up to 512x256) without bells and whistles (e.g. super resolution). At the core of EVA3D is a compositional human NeRF representation, which divides the human body into local parts. Each part is represented by an individual volume. This compositional representation enables 1) inherent human priors, 2) adaptive allocation of network parameters, 3) efficient training and rendering. Moreover, to accommodate for the characteristics of sparse 2D human image collections (e.g. imbalanced pose distribution), we propose a pose-guided sampling strategy for better GAN learning. Extensive experiments validate that EVA3D achieves state-of-the-art 3D human generation performance regarding both geometry and texture quality.

    "title": "Voxurf: Voxel-based Efficient and Accurate Neural Surface Reconstruction",

    "abstract": "Neural surface reconstruction aims to reconstruct accurate 3D surfaces based on multi-view images. Previous methods based on neural volume rendering mostly train a fully implicit model with MLPs, which typically require hours of training for a single scene. Recent efforts explore the explicit volumetric representation to accelerate the optimization via memorizing significant information with learnable voxel grids. However, existing voxel-based methods often struggle in reconstructing fine-grained geometry, even when combined with an SDF-based volume rendering scheme. We reveal that this is because 1) the voxel grids tend to break the color-geometry dependency that facilitates fine-geometry learning, and 2) the under-constrained voxel grids lack spatial coherence and are vulnerable to local minima. In this work, we present Voxurf, a voxel-based surface reconstruction approach that is both efficient and accurate. Voxurf addresses the aforementioned issues via several key designs, including 1) a two-stage training procedure that attains a coherent coarse shape and recovers fine details successively, 2) a dual color network that maintains color-geometry dependency, and 3) a hierarchical geometry feature to encourage information propagation across voxels. Extensive experiments show that Voxurf achieves high efficiency and high quality at the same time. On the DTU benchmark, Voxurf achieves higher reconstruction quality with a 20x training speedup compared to previous fully implicit methods.

    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "Intelligent systems deployed in the real world suffer from catastrophic forgetting when exposed to a sequence of tasks. Humans, on the other hand, acquire, consolidate, and transfer knowledge between tasks that rarely interfere with the consolidated knowledge. Accompanied by self-regulated neurogenesis, continual learning in the brain is governed by the rich set of neurophysiological processes that harbor different types of knowledge which are then integrated by the conscious processing. Thus, inspired by Global Workspace Theory of conscious information access in the brain, we propose TAMiL, a continual learning method that entails task-attention modules to capture task-specific information from the common representation space. We employ simple, undercomplete autoencoders to create a communication bottleneck between the common representation space and the global workspace, allowing only the task-relevant information to the global workspace, thereby greatly reducing task interference. Experimental results show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art rehearsal-based and dynamic sparse approaches and bridges the gap between fixed capacity and parameter isolation approaches while being scalable. We also show that our method effectively mitigates catastrophic forgetting while being well-calibrated with reduced task-recency bias",

Conventional wisdom suggests that, in this setting, models are trained using an approach called experience replay, where the risk is computed both with respect to current stream observations and to a small subset of past observations. In this work, we explain both theoretically and empirically how experience replay biases the outputs of the model towards recent stream observations. Moreover, we propose a simple approach to mitigate this bias online, by changing how the output layer of the model is optimized. We show that our approach improves significantly the learning performance of experience-replay approaches over different datasets. Our findings suggest that, when performing experience replay, the output layer of the model should be optimized separately from the preceding layers",

    "abstract": "The transferability of adversarial examples across deep neural networks (DNNs) is the crux of many black-box attacks. Many prior efforts have been devoted to improving the transferability via increasing the diversity in inputs of some substitute models. In this paper, by contrast, we opt for the diversity in substitute models and advocate to attack a Bayesian model for achieving desirable transferability. Deriving from the Bayesian formulation, we develop a principled strategy for possible finetuning, which can be combined with many off-the-shelf Gaussian posterior approximations over DNN parameters. Extensive experiments have been conducted to verify the effectiveness of our method, on common benchmark datasets, and the results demonstrate that our method outperforms recent state-of-the-arts by large margins (roughly 19% absolute increase in average attack success rate on ImageNet), and, by combining with these recent methods, further performance gain can be obtained.

    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "More and more evidence has shown that strengthening layer interactions can enhance the representation power of a deep neural network, while self-attention excels at learning interdependencies by retrieving query-activated information. Motivated by this, we devise a cross-layer attention mechanism, called multi-head recurrent layer attention (MRLA), that sends a query representation of the current layer to all previous layers to retrieve query-related information from different levels of receptive fields. A light-weighted version of MRLA is also proposed to reduce the quadratic computation cost. The proposed layer attention mechanism can enrich the representation power of many state-of-the-art vision networks, including CNNs and vision transformers. Its effectiveness has been extensively evaluated in image classification, object detection and instance segmentation tasks, where improvements can be consistently observed. For example, our MRLA can improve 1.6% Top-1 accuracy on ResNet-50, while only introducing 0.16M parameters and 0.07B FLOPs. Surprisingly, it can boost the performances by a large margin of 3-4% box AP and mask AP in dense prediction tasks. Our code is available at https://github.com/joyfang1106/MRLA",

    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "Recently, sequence learning methods have been applied to the problem of off-policy Reinforcement Learning, including the seminal work on Decision Transformers, which employs transformers for this task. Since transformers are parameter-heavy, cannot benefit from history longer than a fixed window size, and are not computed using recurrence, we set out to investigate the suitability of the S4 family of models, which are based on state-space layers and have been shown to outperform transformers, especially in modeling long-range dependencies. In this work, we present two main algorithms: (i) an off-policy training procedure that works with trajectories, while still maintaining the training efficiency of the S4 model. (ii) An on-policy training procedure that is trained in a recurrent manner, benefits from long-range dependencies, and is based on a novel stable actor-critic mechanism. Our results indicate that our method outperforms multiple variants of decision transformers, as well as the other baseline methods on most tasks, while reducing the latency, number of parameters, and training time by several orders of magnitude, making our approach more suitable for real-world RL",

    "title": "Unveiling the sampling density in non-uniform geometric graphs",
    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "A powerful framework for studying graphs is to consider them as geometric graphs: nodes are randomly sampled from an underlying metric space, and any pair of nodes is connected if their distance is less than a specified neighborhood radius. Currently, the literature mostly focuses on uniform sampling and constant neighborhood radius. However, real-world graphs are likely to be better represented by a model in which the sampling density and the neighborhood radius can both vary over the latent space. For instance, in a social network communities can be modeled as densely sampled areas, and hubs as nodes with larger neighborhood radius. In this work, we first perform a rigorous mathematical analysis of this (more general) class of models, including derivations of the resulting graph shift operators. The key insight is that graph shift operators should be corrected in order to avoid potential distortions introduced by the non-uniform sampling. Then, we develop methods to estimate the unknown sampling density in a self-supervised fashion. Finally, we present exemplary applications in which the learnt density is used to 1) correct the graph shift operator and improve performance on a variety of tasks, 2) improve pooling, and 3) extract knowledge from networks. Our experimental findings support our theory and provide strong evidence for our model",

    "title": "Boosting Causal Discovery via Adaptive Sample Reweighting",
    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "Under stringent model type and variable distribution assumptions, score-based causal discovery methods learn the directed acyclic graph (DAG) from observational data by evaluating candidate graphs over an averaged score function. Despite the great success in low-dimensional linear systems, it has been observed that these approaches overly exploits easier-to-fit samples, thus inevitably learning spurious edges. Worse still, the common homogeneity assumption of most causal discovery methods can be easily violated due to the widespread existence of heterogeneous data in the real world, resulting in performance vulnerability when noise distributions vary. We propose a simple yet effective model-agnostic framework to boost causal discovery performance by dynamically learning the adaptive weights for the Reweighted Score function, ReScore for short, where the learned weights tailors quantitatively to the important degree of each samples. Intuitively, we leverage the bilevel optimization scheme to alternatively train a standard DAG learner first, then upweight the samples that the DAG learner fails to fit well and downweight the samples that the DAG learner easily extracts the causation information from. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets are carried out to validate the effectiveness of ReScore. We observe consistent and significant boosts in structure learning performance. We further visualize that ReScore concurrently mitigates the influence of spurious edges and generalizes to heterogeneous data. Finally, we perform theoretical analysis to guarantee the structure identifiability and the weight adaptive properties of ReScore. Our codes are available at https://github.com/anzhang314/ReScore",

In addition, our proposed repair mechanism significantly improves the automated synthesis of circuits from LTL specifications with Transformers.

    "title": "Can BERT Refrain from Forgetting on Sequential Tasks? A Probing Study",
    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "Large pre-trained language models have helped to achieve state of the art on a variety of NLP tasks, nevertheless, they still suffer from forgetting when incrementally learning a series of sequential tasks. To alleviate this problem, recent works propose several models enhanced by sparse experience replay and local adaption, which yield satisfactory performance. However, in this paper we find that pre-trained language models like BERT have a potential ability to learn sequentially, even without any sparse memory replay. To verify the ability of BERT to maintain old knowledge, we adopt and re-finetune single-layer probe networks with the parameters of BERT fixed. We investigate the models on two typical kinds of NLP tasks, text classification and extractive question answering. And our experiments reveal that BERT can actually generate high quality representations for previous tasks in a long term, under extremely sparse replay or even no replay. We further introduce a series of methods to interpret the mechanism of forgetting and how memory rehearsal plays a significant role in task incremental learning, which bridges the gap between our new discovery and previous studies about catastrophic forgetting. Additionally, we provide both quantified and visualized results demonstrating that the representation space of BERT is always topologically organised, which guarantees its performance",

    "title": "Mole-BERT: Rethinking Pre-training Graph Neural Networks for Molecules",
    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "Recent years have witnessed the prosperity of pre-training graph neural networks (GNNs) for molecules. Typically, atom types as node attributes are randomly masked, and GNNs are then trained to predict masked types as in AttrMask \\citep{hu2020strategies}, following the Masked Language Modeling (MLM) task of BERT~\\citep{devlin2019bert}. However, unlike MLM with a large vocabulary, the AttrMask pre-training does not learn informative molecular representations due to small and unbalanced atom `vocabulary'. To amend this problem, we propose a variant of VQ-VAE~\\citep{van2017neural} as a context-aware tokenizer to encode atom attributes into chemically meaningful discrete codes. This can enlarge the atom vocabulary size and mitigate the quantitative divergence between dominant (e.g., carbons) and rare atoms (e.g., phosphorus). With the enlarged atom `vocabulary', we propose a novel node-level pre-training task, dubbed Masked Atoms Modeling (\\textbf{MAM}), to mask some discrete codes randomly and then pre-train GNNs to predict them. MAM also mitigates another issue of AttrMask, namely the negative transfer. It can be easily combined with various pre-training tasks to improve their performance. Furthermore, we propose triplet masked contrastive learning (\\textbf{TMCL}) for graph-level pre-training to model the heterogeneous semantic similarity between molecules for effective molecule retrieval. MAM and TMCL constitute a novel pre-training framework, \\textbf{Mole-BERT}, which can match or outperform state-of-the-art methods in a fully data-driven manner. We release the code at \\textcolor{magenta}{\\url{https://github.com/junxia97/Mole-BERT}}",

    "title": "A Message Passing Perspective on Learning Dynamics of Contrastive Learning",
    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "In recent years, contrastive learning achieves impressive results on self-supervised visual representation learning, but there still lacks a rigorous understanding of its learning dynamics. In this paper, we show that if we cast a contrastive objective equivalently into the feature space, then its learning dynamics admits an interpretable form. Specifically, we show that its gradient descent corresponds to a specific message passing scheme on the corresponding augmentation graph. Based on this perspective, we theoretically characterize how contrastive learning gradually learns discriminative features with the alignment update and the uniformity update. Meanwhile, this perspective also establishes an intriguing connection between contrastive learning and Message Passing Graph Neural Networks (MP-GNNs). This connection not only provides a unified understanding of many techniques independently developed in each community, but also enables us to borrow techniques from MP-GNNs to design new contrastive learning variants, such as graph attention, graph rewiring, jumpy knowledge techniques, etc. We believe that our message passing perspective not only provides a new theoretical understanding of contrastive learning dynamics, but also bridges the two seemingly independent areas together, which could inspire more interleaving studies to benefit from each other.

    "title": "Zeroth-Order Optimization with Trajectory-Informed Derivative Estimation",
    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "Zeroth-order (ZO) optimization, in which the derivative is unavailable, has recently succeeded in many important machine learning applications. Existing algorithms rely on finite difference (FD) methods for derivative estimation and gradient descent (GD)-based approaches for optimization. However, these algorithms suffer from query inefficiency because many additional function queries are required for derivative estimation in their every GD update, which typically hinders their deployment in real-world applications where every function query is expensive. To this end, we propose a trajectory-informed derivative estimation method which only employs the optimization trajectory (i.e., the history of function queries during optimization) and hence can eliminate the need for additional function queries to estimate a derivative. Moreover, based on our derivative estimation, we propose the technique of dynamic virtual updates, which allows us to reliably perform multiple steps of GD updates without reapplying derivative estimation. Based on these two contributions, we introduce the zeroth-order optimization with trajectory-informed derivative estimation (ZoRD) algorithm for query-efficient ZO optimization. We theoretically demonstrate that our trajectory-informed derivative estimation and our ZoRD algorithm improve over existing approaches, which is then supported by our real-world experiments such as black-box adversarial attack, non-differentiable metric optimization, and derivative-free reinforcement learning",

    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "This paper investigates a missing feature imputation problem for graph learning tasks. Several methods have previously addressed learning tasks on graphs with missing features. However, in cases of high rates of missing features, they were unable to avoid significant performance degradation. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a novel concept of channel-wise confidence in a node feature, which is assigned to each imputed channel feature of a node for reflecting the certainty of the imputation. We then design pseudo-confidence using the channel-wise shortest path distance between a missing-feature node and its nearest known-feature node to replace unavailable true confidence in an actual learning process. Based on the pseudo-confidence, we propose a novel feature imputation scheme that performs channel-wise inter-node diffusion and node-wise inter-channel propagation. The scheme can endure even at an exceedingly high missing rate (e.g., 99.5\\%) and it achieves state-of-the-art accuracy for both semi-supervised node classification and link prediction on various datasets containing a high rate of missing features.

    "abstract": "Individual privacy accounting enables bounding differential privacy (DP) loss individually for each participant involved in the analysis. This can be informative as often the individual privacy losses are considerably smaller than those indicated by the DP bounds that are based on considering worst-case bounds at each data access. In order to account for the individual losses in a principled manner, we need a privacy accountant for adaptive compositions of mechanisms, where the loss incurred at a given data access is allowed to be smaller than the worst-case loss. This kind of analysis has been carried out for the Rényi differential privacy by Feldman and Zrnic (2021), however not yet for the so-called optimal privacy accountants. We make first steps in this direction by providing a careful analysis using the Gaussian differential privacy which gives optimal bounds for the Gaussian mechanism, one of the most versatile DP mechanisms. This approach is based on determining a certain supermartingale for the hockey-stick divergence and on extending the Rényi divergence-based fully adaptive composition results by Feldman and Zrnic (2021). We also consider measuring the individual $(\\varepsilon,\\delta)$-privacy losses using the so-called privacy loss distributions. Using the Blackwell theorem, we can then use the results of Feldman and Zrnic (2021) to construct an approximative individual $(\\varepsilon,\\delta)$-accountant. We also show how to speed up the FFT-based individual DP accounting using the Plancherel theorem",

    "title": "Evolving Populations of Diverse RL Agents with MAP-Elites",
    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "Quality Diversity (QD) has emerged as a powerful alternative optimization paradigm that aims at generating large and diverse collections of solutions, notably with its flagship algorithm MAP-ELITES (ME) which evolves solutions through mutations and crossovers. While very effective for some unstructured problems, early ME implementations relied exclusively on random search to evolve the population of solutions, rendering them notoriously sample-inefficient for high-dimensional problems, such as when evolving neural networks. Follow-up works considered exploiting gradient information to guide the search in order to address these shortcomings through techniques borrowed from either Black-Box Optimization (BBO) or Reinforcement Learning (RL). While mixing RL techniques with ME unlocked state-of-the-art performance for robotics control problems that require a good amount of exploration, it also plagued these ME variants with limitations common among RL algorithms that ME was free of, such as hyperparameter sensitivity, high stochasticity as well as training instability, including when the population size increases as some components are shared across the population in recent approaches. Furthermore, existing approaches mixing ME with RL tend to be tied to a specific RL algorithm, which effectively prevents their use on problems where the corresponding RL algorithm fails. To address these shortcomings, we introduce a flexible framework that allows the use of any RL algorithm and alleviates the aforementioned limitations by evolving populations of agents (whose definition include hyperparameters and all learnable parameters) instead of just policies. We demonstrate the benefits brought about by our framework through extensive numerical experiments on a number of robotics control problems, some of which with deceptive rewards, taken from the QD-RL literature. We open source an efficient JAX-based implementation of our algorithm in the QDax library",

Designing novel proteins with specific structures and desired functions has been a long-standing challenge in the field of bioengineering. Existing approaches generate both protein sequence and structure using either autoregressive models or diffusion models, both of which suffer from high inference costs. In this paper, we propose a new approach capable of protein sequence and structure co-design, which iteratively translates both protein sequence and structure into the desired state from random initialization, based on context features given a priori. Our model consists of a trigonometry-aware encoder that reasons geometrical constraints and interactions from context features, and a roto-translation equivariant decoder that translates protein sequence and structure interdependently. Notably, all protein amino acids are updated in one shot in each translation step, which significantly accelerates the inference process. Experimental results across multiple tasks show that our model outperforms previous state-of-the-art baselines by a large margin, and is able to design proteins of high fidelity as regards both sequence and structure, with running time orders of magnitude less than sampling-based methods",

We demonstrate that the PLMs are well-calibrated on the masked language modeling task with robust predictive confidence under domain shift, yet the fine-tuned models fail to retain such property due to catastrophic forgetting, which impacts the calibration on the downstream classification task. In light of these observations, we evaluate the calibration of several methods that preserve pre-trained features and show that preserving pre-trained features can improve the calibration of fine-tuned language models. Among these methods, our proposed method that encourages the fine-tuned model to learn generative representations with auxiliary language modeling objective achieves competitive accuracy and the lowest expected calibration error compared to several strong baselines under both in-domain and out-of-domain settings on three downstream NLU tasks",

Besides dealing with this long-standing task in the spatial domain, a few approaches seek solutions in the frequency domain in consideration of the large discrepancy between spectra of sharp/degraded image pairs. However, these works commonly utilize transformation tools, e.g., wavelet transform, to split features into several frequency parts, which is not flexible enough to select the most informative frequency component to recover. In this paper, we exploit a multi-branch and content-aware module to decompose features into separate frequency subbands dynamically and locally, and then accentuate the useful ones via channel-wise attention weights. In addition, to handle large-scale degradation blurs, we propose an extremely simple decoupling and modulation module to enlarge the receptive field via global and window-based average pooling. Integrating two developed modules into a U-Net backbone, the proposed Selective Frequency Network (SFNet) performs favorably against state-of-the-art algorithms on five image restoration tasks, including single-image defocus deblurring, image dehazing, image motion deblurring, image desnowing, and image deraining",

We find that UniMax outperforms standard temperature-based sampling, and the benefits persist as scale increases.

    "abstract": "Recently, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have significantly advanced the performance of machine learning tasks on graphs. However, this technological breakthrough makes people wonder: how does a GNN make such decisions, and can we trust its prediction with high confidence? When it comes to some critical fields, such as biomedicine, where making wrong decisions can have severe consequences, it is crucial to interpret the inner working mechanisms of GNNs before applying them. In this paper, we propose a model-agnostic model-level explanation method for different GNNs that follow the message passing scheme, GNNInterpreter, to explain the high-level decision-making process of the GNN model. More specifically, GNNInterpreter learns a probabilistic generative graph distribution that produces the most discriminative graph pattern the GNN tries to detect when making a certain prediction by optimizing a novel objective function specifically designed for the model-level explanation for GNNs. Compared to existing works, GNNInterpreter is more flexible and computationally efficient in generating explanation graphs with different types of node and edge features, without introducing another blackbox or requiring manually specified domain-specific rules. In addition, the experimental studies conducted on four different datasets demonstrate that the explanation graphs generated by GNNInterpreter match the desired graph pattern if the model is ideal; otherwise, potential model pitfalls can be revealed by the explanation",

Previous work has generally found that strong performance on these problems requires the incorporation of inductive biases that are specific to the RPM problem format, raising the question of whether such models might be more broadly useful. Here, we investigated the extent to which a general-purpose mechanism for processing visual scenes in terms of objects might help promote abstract visual reasoning. We found that a simple model, consisting only of an object-centric encoder and a transformer reasoning module, achieved state-of-the-art results on both of two challenging RPM-like benchmarks (PGM and I-RAVEN), as well as a novel benchmark with greater visual complexity (CLEVR-Matrices). These results suggest that an inductive bias for object-centric processing may be a key component of abstract visual reasoning, obviating the need for problem-specific inductive biases",

    "abstract": "Recently, graph-based planning algorithms have gained much attention to solve goal-conditioned reinforcement learning (RL) tasks: they provide a sequence of subgoals to reach the target-goal, and the agents learn to execute subgoal-conditioned policies. However, the sample-efficiency of such RL schemes still remains a challenge, particularly for long-horizon tasks. To address this issue, we present a simple yet effective self-imitation scheme which distills a subgoal-conditioned policy into the target-goal-conditioned policy. Our intuition here is that to reach a target-goal, an agent should pass through a subgoal, so target-goal- and subgoal- conditioned policies should be similar to each other. We also propose a novel scheme of stochastically skipping executed subgoals in a planned path, which further improves performance. Unlike prior methods that only utilize graph-based planning in an execution phase, our method transfers knowledge from a planner along with a graph into policy learning. We empirically show that our method can significantly boost the sample-efficiency of the existing goal-conditioned RL methods under various long-horizon control tasks",

However, the recent work of [Saunshi et al.] argues that the model architecture --- a component largely ignored by previous works --- also has significant influences on the downstream performance of self-supervised learning. In this work, we provide the first theoretical analysis of self-supervised learning that incorporates the effect of inductive biases originating from the model class. In particular, we focus on contrastive learning --- a popular self-supervised learning method that is widely used in the vision domain. We show that when the model has limited capacity, contrastive representations would recover certain special clustering structures that are compatible with the model architecture, but ignore many other clustering structures in the data distribution. As a result, our theory can capture the more realistic setting where contrastive representations have much lower dimensionality than the number of clusters in the data distribution. We instantiate our theory on several synthetic data distributions, and provide empirical evidence to support the theory",

We provide the first gap-dependent and fully adaptive pure exploration algorithms on two types of causal models --- the binary generalized linear model (BGLM) and general graphs. For BGLM, our algorithm is the first to be designed specifically for this setting and achieves polynomial sample complexity, while all existing algorithms for general graphs have either sample complexity exponential to the graph size or some unreasonable assumptions. For general graphs, our algorithm provides a significant improvement on sample complexity, and it nearly matches the lower bound we prove. Our algorithms achieve such improvement by a novel integration of prior causal bandit algorithms and prior adaptive pure exploration algorithms, the former of which utilize the rich observational feedback in causal bandits but are not adaptive to reward gaps, while the latter of which have the issue in reverse",

    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "Unlike current state-of-the-art language models, young children actively acquire language through interactions with their surrounding environment and caretakers. One mechanism that has been argued to be critical to language learning is the ability to infer the mental states of other agents in social environments, coined Theory of Mind (ToM) by Premack & Woodruff (1978). Drawing inspiration from the modern operationalized versions of ToM implemented in Rabinowitz et al. (2018) and Zhu et al. (2021), we build language-learning agents equipped with ToM, and measure its effects on the learning process. We model ToM by giving the speaker agent an internal listener model that is trained alongside the speaker and used to rerank potential utterances. We experiment with varying task difficulty, hypothesizing that models will acquire more complex language to adapt to stronger environmental pressures. We find that training speakers with a highly weighted ToM listener component leads to performance gains in our image referential game setting. We also find some evidence that increasing task difficulty in the training process results in more fluent and precise utterances in evaluation. This suggests the potential utility of further incorporating ToM, as well as other insights from child language acquisition, into computational models of language acquisition",

    "abstract": "Recently, there has been a growing surge of interest in enabling machine learning systems to generalize well to Out-of-Distribution (OOD) data. Most efforts are devoted to advancing optimization objectives that regularize models to capture the underlying invariance; however, there often are compromises in the optimization process of these OOD objectives: i) Many OOD objectives have to be relaxed as penalty terms of Empirical Risk Minimization (ERM) for the ease of optimization, while the relaxed forms can weaken the robustness of the original objective; ii) The penalty terms also require careful tuning of the penalty weights due to the intrinsic conflicts between ERM and OOD objectives. Consequently, these compromises could easily lead to suboptimal performance of either the ERM or OOD objective. To address these issues, we introduce a multi-objective optimization (MOO) perspective to understand the OOD optimization process, and propose a new optimization scheme called PAreto Invariant Risk Minimization (PAIR). PAIR improves the robustness of OOD objectives by cooperatively optimizing with other OOD objectives, thereby bridging the gaps caused by the relaxations. Then PAIR approaches a Pareto optimal solution that trades off the ERM and OOD objectives properly. Extensive experiments on challenging benchmarks, WILDS, show that PAIR alleviates the compromises and yields top OOD performances",

    "title": "What Makes Convolutional Models Great on Long Sequence Modeling?",
    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "Convolutional models have been widely used in multiple domains. However, most existing models only use local convolution, making the model unable to handle long-range dependencies efficiently. Attention overcomes this problem by aggregating global information based on the pair-wise attention score but also makes the computational complexity quadratic to the sequence length. Recently, Gu et al. proposed a model called S4 inspired by the state space model. S4 can be efficiently implemented as a global convolutional model whose kernel size equals the input sequence length. With Fast Fourier Transform, S4 can model much longer sequences than Transformers and achieve significant gains over SoTA on several long-range tasks. Despite its empirical success, S4 is involved. It requires sophisticated parameterization and initialization schemes that combine the wisdom from several prior works. As a result, S4 is less intuitive and hard to use for researchers with limited prior knowledge. Here we aim to demystify S4 and extract basic principles that contribute to the success of S4 as a global convolutional model. We focus on the structure of the convolution kernel and identify two critical but intuitive principles enjoyed by S4 that are sufficient to make up an effective global convolutional model: 1) The parameterization of the convolutional kernel needs to be efficient in the sense that the number of parameters should scale sub-linearly with sequence length. 2) The kernel needs to satisfy a decaying structure that the weights for convolving with closer neighbors are larger than the more distant ones. Based on the two principles, we propose a simple yet effective convolutional model called Structured Global Convolution (SGConv). SGConv exhibits strong empirical performance over several tasks: 1) With faster speed, SGConv surpasses the previous SoTA on Long Range Arena and Speech Command datasets. 2) When plugging SGConv into standard language and vision models, it shows the potential to improve both efficiency and performance",

A task vector specifies a direction in the weight space of a pre-trained model, such that movement in that direction improves performance on the task. We build task vectors by subtracting the weights of a pre-trained model from the weights of the same model after fine-tuning on a task. We show that these task vectors can be modified and combined together through arithmetic operations such as negation and addition, and the behavior of the resulting model is steered accordingly. Moreover, task vectors can be added together to improve performance on multiple tasks at once. Finally, when tasks are linked by an analogy relationship of the form ``A is to B as C is to D\", combining task vectors from three of the tasks can improve performance on the fourth, even when no data from the fourth task is used for training",

Despite their ability to generate high-quality yet creative images, we observe that attribution-binding and compositional capabilities are still considered major challenging issues, especially when involving multiple objects. Attribute-binding requires the model to associate objects with the correct attribute descriptions, and compositional skills require the model to combine and generate multiple concepts into a single image. In this work, we improve these two aspects of T2I models to achieve more accurate image compositions. To do this, we incorporate linguistic structures with the diffusion guidance process based on the controllable properties of manipulating cross-attention layers in diffusion-based T2I models. We observe that keys and values in cross-attention layers have strong semantic meanings associated with object layouts and content. Therefore, by manipulating the cross-attention representations based on linguistic insights, we can better preserve the compositional semantics in the generated image. Built upon Stable Diffusion, a SOTA T2I model, our structured cross-attention design is efficient that requires no additional training samples. We achieve better compositional skills in qualitative and quantitative results, leading to a significant 5-8\\% advantage in head-to-head user comparison studies. Lastly, we conduct an in-depth analysis to reveal potential causes of incorrect image compositions and justify the properties of cross-attention layers in the generation process",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we evaluate and improve the generalization performance for reinforcement learning (RL) agents on the set of ``controllable'' states, where good policies exist on these states to achieve the goal. An RL agent that generally masters a task should reach its goal starting from any controllable state of the environment instead of memorizing a small set of trajectories. To practically evaluate this type of generalization, we propose relay evaluation, which starts the test agent from the middle of other independently well-trained stranger agents' trajectories. With extensive experimental evaluation, we show the prevalence of generalization failure on controllable states from stranger agents. For example, in the Humanoid environment, we observed that a well-trained Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) agent, with only 3.9\\% failure rate during regular testing, failed on 81.6\\% of the states generated by well-trained stranger PPO agents. To improve \"relay generalization,\" we propose a novel method called Self-Trajectory Augmentation (STA), which will reset the environment to the agent's old states according to the Q function during training. After applying STA to the Soft Actor Critic's (SAC) training procedure, we reduced the failure rate of SAC under relay-evaluation by more than three times in most settings without impacting agent performance and increasing the needed number of environment interactions.

    "abstract": "The electronic design automation of analog circuits has been a longstanding challenge in the integrated circuit field due to the huge design space and complex design trade-offs among circuit specifications. In the past decades, intensive research efforts have only been paid to automate the transistor sizing with a given circuit topology. By recognizing the graph nature of circuits, this paper presents a Circuit Graph Neural Network (CktGNN) that simultaneously automates the circuit topology generation and device sizing based on the encoder-dependent optimization subroutines. Particularly, CktGNN encodes circuit graphs using a two-level GNN framework (of nested GNN) where circuits are represented as combinations of subgraphs in a known subgraph basis. In this way, it significantly improves efficiency by reducing the number of subgraphs to perform message passing. Nonetheless, another critical roadblock to advancing learning-assisted circuit design automation is a lack of public benchmarks to perform canonical assessment and reproducible research. To tackle the challenge, we introduce Open Circuit Benchmark (OCB), an open-sourced dataset that contains $10$K distinct operational amplifiers with carefully-extracted circuit specifications from physical implementations. OCB also equips with communicative circuit generation and evaluation capabilities such that it can be used to generalize the applicability of CktGNN to design various analog circuits by efficiently producing corresponding datasets. Experiments on OCB show the extraordinary advantages of CktGNN through representation-based optimization frameworks over other recent powerful GNN baselines and manual design from human experts.

However, most existing spectral graph filters are scalar-to-scalar functions, i.e., mapping a single eigenvalue to a single filtered value, thus ignoring the global pattern of the spectrum. Furthermore, these filters are often constructed based on some fixed-order polynomials, which have limited expressiveness and flexibility. To tackle these issues, we introduce Specformer, which effectively encodes the set of all eigenvalues and performs self-attention in the spectral domain, leading to a learnable set-to-set spectral filter. We also design a decoder with learnable bases to enable non-local graph convolution. Importantly, Specformer is equivariant to permutation. By stacking multiple Specformer layers, one can build a powerful spectral GNN. On synthetic datasets, we show that our Specformer can better recover ground-truth spectral filters than other spectral GNNs.

    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "Time series observations can be seen as realizations of an underlying dynamical system governed by rules that we typically do not know. For time series learning tasks we create our model using available data. Training on available realizations, where data is limited, often induces severe over-fitting thereby preventing generalization. To address this issue, we introduce a general recursive framework for time series augmentation, which we call the Recursive Interpolation Method (RIM). New augmented time series are generated using a recursive interpolation function from the original time series for use in training. We perform theoretical analysis to characterize the proposed RIM and to guarantee its performance under certain conditions. We apply RIM to diverse synthetic and real-world time series cases to achieve strong performance over non-augmented data on a variety of learning tasks. Our method is also computationally more efficient and leads to better performance when compared to state of the art time series data augmentation",

    "title": "Auto-Encoding Goodness of Fit",
    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "For generative autoencoders to learn a meaningful latent representation for data generation, a careful balance must be achieved between reconstruction error and how close the distribution in the latent space is to the prior. However, this balance is challenging to achieve due to a lack of criteria that work both at the mini-batch (local) and aggregated posterior (global) level. In this work, we develop the Goodness of Fit Autoencoder (GoFAE), which incorporates hypothesis tests at two levels. At the mini-batch level, it uses GoF test statistics as regularization objectives. At a more global level, it selects a regularization coefficient based on higher criticism, i.e., a test on the uniformity of the local GoF p-values. We justify the use of GoF tests by providing a relaxed $L_2$-Wasserstein bound on the distance between the latent distribution and target prior. We propose to use GoF tests and prove that optimization based on these tests can be done with stochastic gradient (SGD) descent on a compact Riemannian manifold. Empirically, we show that our higher criticism parameter selection procedure balances reconstruction and generation using mutual information and uniformity of p-values respectively. Finally, we show that GoFAE achieves comparable FID scores and mean squared errors with competing deep generative models while retaining statistical indistinguishability from Gaussian in the latent space based on a variety of hypothesis tests",

    "title": "Understanding the Covariance Structure of Convolutional Filters",
    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "Neural network weights are typically initialized at random from univariate distributions, controlling just the variance of individual weights even in highly-structured operations like convolutions. Recent ViT-inspired convolutional networks such as ConvMixer and ConvNeXt use large-kernel depthwise convolutions whose learned filters have notable structure; this presents an opportunity to study their empirical covariances. In this work, we first observe that such learned filters have highly-structured covariance matrices, and moreover, we find that covariances calculated from small networks may be used to effectively initialize a variety of larger networks of different depths, widths, patch sizes, and kernel sizes, indicating a degree of model-independence to the covariance structure. Motivated by these findings, we then propose a learning-free multivariate initialization scheme for convolutional filters using a simple, closed-form construction of their covariance. Models using our initialization outperform those using traditional univariate initializations, and typically meet or exceed the performance of those initialized from the covariances of learned filters; in some cases, this improvement can be achieved without training the depthwise convolutional filters at all.

    "abstract": "Distilling from the feature maps can be fairly effective for dense prediction tasks since both the feature discriminability and localization information can be well transferred. However, not every pixel contributes equally to the performance, and a good student should learn from what really matters to the teacher. In this paper, we introduce a learnable embedding dubbed receptive token to locate the pixels of interests (PoIs) in the feature map, with a distillation mask generated via pixel-wise attention. Then the masked distillation will be performed via the pixel-wise reconstruction. In this way, a distillation mask refers to a pattern of pixel dependencies. We thus adopt multiple receptive tokens to investigate more sophisticated and informative pixel dependencies within feature maps to enhance the distillation. To obtain a group of masks, the receptive tokens are learned via the regular task loss but with teacher fixed, and we also leverage a Dice loss to enrich the diversity of obtained masks. Our method dubbed MasKD is simple and practical, and needs no priors of ground-truth labels, which can apply to various dense prediction tasks. Experiments show that our MasKD can achieve state-of-the-art performance consistently on object detection and semantic segmentation benchmarks",

Our studies discover a new attack pattern that negatively impact the forecasting of a target time series via making strategic, sparse (imperceptible) modifications to the past observations of a small number of other time series. To mitigate the impact of such attack, we have developed two defense strategies. First, we extend a previously developed randomized smoothing technique in classification to multivariate forecasting scenarios. Second, we develop an adversarial training algorithm that learns to create adversarial examples and at the same time optimizes the forecasting model to improve its robustness against such adversarial simulation.

    "abstract": "Adversarial attack serves as a major challenge for neural network models in NLP, which precludes the model's deployment in safety-critical applications. A recent line of work, detection-based defense, aims to distinguish adversarial sentences from benign ones. However, {the core limitation of previous detection methods is being incapable of giving correct predictions on adversarial sentences unlike defense methods from other paradigms.} To solve this issue, this paper proposes TextShield: (1) we discover a link between text attack and saliency information, and then we propose a saliency-based detector, which can effectively detect whether an input sentence is adversarial or not. (2) We design a saliency-based corrector, which converts the detected adversary sentences to benign ones. By combining the saliency-based detector and corrector, TextShield extends the detection-only paradigm to a detection-correction paradigm, thus filling the gap in the existing detection-based defense. Comprehensive experiments show that (a) TextShield consistently achieves higher or comparable performance than state-of-the-art defense methods across various attacks on different benchmarks.

While many prior works have shown that proper regularization techniques are crucial for enabling data-efficient RL, a general understanding of the bottlenecks in data-efficient RL has remained unclear. Consequently, it has been difficult to devise a universal technique that works well across all domains. In this paper, we attempt to understand the primary bottleneck in sample-efficient deep RL by examining several potential hypotheses such as non-stationarity, excessive action distribution shift, and overfitting. We perform thorough empirical analysis on state-based DeepMind control suite (DMC) tasks in a controlled and systematic way to show that high temporal-difference (TD) error on the validation set of transitions is the main culprit that severely affects the performance of deep RL algorithms, and prior methods that lead to good performance do in fact, control the validation TD error to be low. This observation gives us a robust principle for making deep RL efficient: we can hill-climb on the validation TD error by utilizing any form of regularization techniques from supervised learning. We show that a simple online model selection method that targets the validation TD error is effective across state-based DMC and Gym tasks",

State-Of-The-Art algorithms usually leverage powerful function approximators (e.g. neural networks) to alleviate the sample complexity hurdle for better empirical performances. Despite the successes, a more systematic under- standing of the statistical complexity for function approximation remains lacking. Towards bridging the gap, we take a step by considering offline reinforcement learning with differentiable function class approximation (DFA). This function class naturally incorporates a wide range of models with nonlinear/nonconvex structures. We show offline RL with differentiable function approximation is provably efficient by analyzing the pessimistic fitted Q-learning (PFQL) algorithm, and our results provide the theoretical basis for understanding a variety of practical heuristics that rely on Fitted Q-Iteration style design.

    "abstract": "Auxiliary tasks improve the representations learned by deep reinforcement learning agents. Analytically, their effect is reasonably well-understood; in practice, how-ever, their primary use remains in support of a main learning objective, rather than as a method for learning representations. This is perhaps surprising given that many auxiliary tasks are defined procedurally, and hence can be treated as an essentially infinite source of information about the environment. Based on this observation, we study the effectiveness of auxiliary tasks for learning rich representations, focusing on the setting where the number of tasks and the size of the agent's network are simultaneously increased. For this purpose, we derive a new family of auxiliary tasks based on the successor measure. These tasks are easy to implement and have appealing theoretical properties. Combined with a suitable off-policy learning rule, the result is a representation learning algorithm that can be understood as extending Mahadevan & Maggioni (2007)'s proto-value functions to deep reinforcement learning – accordingly, we call the resulting object proto-value networks. Through a series of experiments on the Arcade Learning Environment, we demonstrate that proto-value networks produce rich features that may be used to obtain performance comparable to established algorithms, using only linear approximation and a small number (~4M) of interactions with the environment's reward function",

For example, we consider robust linear algebraic algorithms when the updates to the input are sparse but given by an adversary with access to a query oracle. We also study robust algorithms in the standard centralized setting, where an adversary queries an algorithm in an adaptive manner, but the number of interactions between the adversary and the algorithm is bounded. We first recall a unified framework of (Hassidim et al., 2020; Beimel et al., 2022; Attias et al., 2023) for answering $Q$ adaptive queries that incurs $\\widetilde{\\mathcal{O}}(\\sqrt{Q})$ overhead in space, which is roughly a quadratic improvement over the na\\\"{i}ve implementation, and only incurs a logarithmic overhead in query time. Although the general framework has diverse applications in machine learning and data science, such as adaptive distance estimation, kernel density estimation, linear regression, range queries, point queries, and serves as a preliminary benchmark, we demonstrate even better algorithmic improvements for (1) reducing the pre-processing time for adaptive distance estimation and (2) permitting an unlimited number of adaptive queries for kernel density estimation.

A lot of studies have been developed to train GNNs in a noisy environment and increase their robustness against adversarial attacks. However, existing methods have not uncovered a principled difficulty: the convoluted mixture distribution between clean and attacked data samples, which leads to sub-optimal model design and limits their frameworks' robustness. In this work, we first begin by identifying the root cause of mixture distribution, then, for tackling it, we propose a novel method GAME - Graph Adversarial Mixture of Experts to enlarge the model capacity and enrich the representation diversity of adversarial samples, from three perspectives of model, training, and optimization. Specifically, we first propose a plug-and- play GAME layer that can be easily incorporated into any GNNs and enhance their adversarial learning capabilities. Second, we design a decoupling-based graph adversarial training in which the component of the model used to generate adversarial graphs is separated from the component used to update weights. Third, we introduce a graph diversity regularization that enables the model to learn diverse representation and further improves model performance.

Still, many classes of MILPs quickly become unsolvable as their sizes increase, motivating researchers to seek new acceleration techniques for MILPs. With deep learning, they have obtained strong empirical results, and many results were obtained by applying graph neural networks (GNNs) to making decisions in various stages of MILP solution processes. This work discovers a fundamental limitation: there exist feasible and infeasible MILPs that all GNNs will, however, treat equally, indicating GNN's lacking power to express general MILPs. Then, we show that, by restricting the MILPs to unfoldable ones or by adding random features, there exist GNNs that can reliably predict MILP feasibility, optimal objective values, and optimal solutions up to prescribed precision.

However, in the literature on federated learning (FL), neural networks are mostly initialized with random weights. These attract our interest in conducting a systematic study to explore pre-training for FL. Across multiple visual recognition benchmarks, we found that pre-training can not only improve FL, but also close its accuracy gap to the counterpart centralized learning, especially in the challenging cases of non-IID clients' data. To make our findings applicable to situations where pre-trained models are not directly available, we explore pre-training with synthetic data or even with clients' data in a decentralized manner, and found that they can already improve FL notably. Interestingly, many of the techniques we explore are complementary to each other to further boost the performance, and we view this as a critical result toward scaling up deep FL for real-world applications. We conclude our paper with an attempt to understand the effect of pre-training on FL. We found that pre-training enables the learned global models under different clients' data conditions to converge to the same loss basin, and makes global aggregation in FL more stable. Nevertheless, pre-training seems to not alleviate local model drifting, a fundamental problem in FL under non-IID data",

In recent years, personalized federated learning (pFL) has emerged as a potential solution to the challenges presented by heterogeneous data. However, existing pFL methods typically enhance performance of local models at the expense of the global model's accuracy. We propose FedHKD (Federated Hyper-Knowledge Distillation), a novel FL algorithm in which clients rely on knowledge distillation (KD) to train local models. In particular, each client extracts and sends to the server the means of local data representations and the corresponding soft predictions -- information that we refer to as ``hyper-knowledge\". The server aggregates this information and broadcasts it to the clients in support of local training. Notably, unlike other KD-based pFL methods, FedHKD does not rely on a public dataset nor it deploys a generative model at the server. We analyze convergence of FedHKD and conduct extensive experiments on visual datasets in a variety of scenarios, demonstrating that FedHKD provides significant improvement in both personalized as well as global model performance compared to state-of-the-art FL methods designed for heterogeneous data settings",

Different environments or tasks may require varying degrees of coordination among agents in order to achieve the goal in an optimal way.

Existing literature has not sufficiently addressed the fact that different environments may have different levels of heterogeneity. We formalize the notions of coordination level and heterogeneity level of an environment and present HECOGrid, a suite of multi-agent RL environments that facilitates empirical evaluation of different MARL approaches across different levels of coordination and environmental heterogeneity by providing a quantitative control over coordination and heterogeneity levels of the environment. Further, we propose a Centralized Training Decentralized Execution learning approach called Stateful Active Facilitator (SAF) that enables agents to work efficiently in high-coordination and high-heterogeneity environments through a differentiable and shared knowledge source used during training and dynamic selection from a shared pool of policies.

    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL)---where multiple agents learn to interact in a shared dynamic environment---permeates across a wide range of critical applications. While there has been substantial progress on understanding the global convergence of policy optimization methods in single-agent RL, designing and analysis of efficient policy optimization algorithms in the MARL setting present significant challenges and new desiderata, which unfortunately, remain highly inadequately addressed by existing theory. In this paper, we focus on the most basic setting of competitive multi-agent RL, namely two-player zero-sum Markov games, and study equilibrium finding algorithms in both the infinite-horizon discounted setting and the finite-horizon episodic setting. We propose a single-loop policy optimization method with symmetric updates from both agents, where the policy is updated via the entropy-regularized optimistic multiplicative weights update (OMWU) method and the value is updated on a slower timescale. We show that, in the full-information tabular setting, the proposed method achieves a finite-time last-iterate linear convergence to the quantal response equilibrium of the regularized problem, which translates to a sublinear convergence to the Nash equilibrium by controlling the amount of regularization. Our convergence results improve upon the best known iteration complexities, and lead to a better understanding of policy optimization in competitive Markov games",

Albeit with some advantages over traditional solvers, current frameworks optimize an averaged performance over the distribution of historical problem instances, which misaligns with the actual goal of CO that looks for a good solution to every future encountered instance. With this observation, we propose a new objective of unsupervised learning for CO where the goal of learning is to search for good initialization for future problem instances rather than give direct solutions. We propose a meta-learning-based training pipeline for this new objective. Our method achieves good performance. We observe that even the initial solution given by our model before fine-tuning can significantly outperform the baselines under various evaluation settings including evaluation across multiple datasets, and the case with big shifts in the problem scale. The reason we conjecture is that meta-learning-based training lets the model be loosely tied to each local optimum for a training instance while being more adaptive to the changes of optimization landscapes across instances",

These theories were developed for stochastic gradient descent. Yet, in practice, all large NN are trained using Adam or other adaptive gradient optimizers (AGO), which are not covered by such previous works. Here, we close this gap via the Tensor Programs framework. Specifically, for deep MLPs, we derive the NTK and $\\mu$ parametrizations as well as their infinite-width limits. We find 1) The NTK limit of AGO, in contrast to that of SGD, now depends nonlinearly on the loss derivative but nevertheless still fails to learn features; 2) this is fixed by the $\\mu$ limit of AGO (as in the case of SGD). To obtain these results, we extend the Tensor Programs language with a new instruction that allows one to express the gradient processing done by AGOs",

Unfortunately, due to the stochastic nature of diffusion models, it is often difficult to maintain the original content of the image during the reverse diffusion. To address this, here we present a novel diffusion-based unsupervised image translation method, dubbed as DiffuseIT, using disentangled style and content representation. Specifically, inspired by the slicing Vision Transformer, we extract intermediate keys of multihead self attention layer from ViT model and used them as the content preservation loss. Then, an image guided style transfer is performed by matching the [CLS] classification token from the denoised samples and target image, whereas additional CLIP loss is used for the text-driven style transfer. To further accelerate the semantic change during the reverse diffusion, we also propose a novel semantic divergence loss and resampling strategy.

In contrast to many existing works in understanding implicit regularization, we prove that our training trajectory cannot be simulated by mirror descent. We analyze the gradient dynamics of the corresponding regression problem in the general noise setting and obtain minimax-optimal error rates. Compared to existing bounds for implicit sparse regularization using diagonal linear networks, our analysis with the new reparameterization shows improved sample complexity.

However, task performance depends significantly on the quality of the prompt used to steer the model, and most effective prompts have been handcrafted by humans. Inspired by classical program synthesis and the human approach to prompt engineering, we propose Automatic Prompt Engineer (APE) for automatic instruction generation and selection. In our method, we treat the instruction as the \"program,\" optimized by searching over a pool of instruction candidates proposed by an LLM in order to maximize a chosen score function. To evaluate the quality of the selected instruction, we evaluate the zero-shot performance of another LLM following the selected instruction. Experiments on 24 NLP tasks show that our automatically generated instructions outperform the prior LLM baseline by a large margin and achieve better or comparable performance to the instructions generated by human annotators on 21/24 tasks. We conduct extensive qualitative and quantitative analyses to explore the performance of APE. We show that APE-engineered prompts can be applied to steer models toward truthfulness and/or informativeness, as well as to improve few-shot learning performance by simply prepending them to standard in-context learning prompts",

    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "In recent years, deep network pruning has attracted significant attention in order to enable the rapid deployment of AI into small devices with computation and memory constraints. Pruning is often achieved by dropping redundant weights, neurons, or layers of a deep network while attempting to retain a comparable test performance. Many deep pruning algorithms have been proposed with impressive empirical success. However, existing approaches lack a quantifiable measure to estimate the compressibility of a sub-network during each pruning iteration and thus may under-prune or over-prune the model. In this work, we propose PQ Index (PQI) to measure the potential compressibility of deep neural networks and use this to develop a Sparsity-informed Adaptive Pruning (SAP) algorithm. Our extensive experiments corroborate the hypothesis that for a generic pruning procedure, PQI decreases first when a large model is being effectively regularized and then increases when its compressibility reaches a limit that appears to correspond to the beginning of underfitting. Subsequently, PQI decreases again when the model collapse and significant deterioration in the performance of the model start to occur. Additionally, our experiments demonstrate that the proposed adaptive pruning algorithm with proper choice of hyper-parameters is superior to the iterative pruning algorithms such as the lottery ticket-based pruning methods, in terms of both compression efficiency and robustness",

In the commonly-used bilevel optimization formulation, the shared parameter is learned in the outer loop by minimizing the average loss over all tasks. However, the converged solution may be comprised in that it only focuses on optimizing on a small subset of tasks. To alleviate this problem, we consider meta-learning as a multi-objective optimization (MOO) problem, in which each task is an objective. However, existing MOO solvers need to access all the objectives' gradients in each iteration, and cannot scale to the huge number of tasks in typical meta-learning settings. To alleviate this problem, we propose a scalable gradient-based solver with the use of mini-batch. We provide theoretical guarantees on the Pareto optimality or Pareto stationarity of the converged solution. Empirical studies on various machine learning settings demonstrate that the proposed method is efficient, and achieves better performance than the baselines, particularly on improving the performance of the poorly-performing tasks and thus alleviating the compromising phenomenon",

Predictor-corrector samplers are a class of samplers for diffusion models, which improve on ancestral samplers by correcting the sampling distribution of intermediate diffusion states using MCMC methods. In DPC, the Langevin corrector, which does not have a direct counterpart in discrete space, is replaced with a discrete MCMC transition defined by a learned corrector kernel. The corrector kernel is trained to make the correction steps achieve asymptotic convergence, in distribution, to the correct marginal of the intermediate diffusion states. Equipped with DPC, we revisit recent transformer-based non-autoregressive generative models through the lens of discrete diffusion, and find that DPC can alleviate the compounding decoding error due to the parallel sampling of visual tokens. Our experiments show that DPC improves upon existing discrete latent space models for class-conditional image generation on ImageNet, and outperforms continuous diffusion models and GANs, according to standard metrics and user preference studies",

    "title": "OPTQ: Accurate Quantization for Generative Pre-trained Transformers",
    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "Generative Pre-trained Transformer models, known as GPT or OPT, set themselves apart through breakthrough performance across complex language modelling tasks, but also by their extremely high computational and storage costs. Specifically, due to their massive size, even inference for large, highly-accurate GPT models may require multiple performant GPUs, which limits the usability of such models. While there is emerging work on relieving this pressure via model compression, the applicability and performance of existing compression techniques is limited by the scale and complexity of GPT models. In this paper, we address this challenge, and propose OPTQ, a new one-shot weight quantization method based on approximate second-order information, that is both highly-accurate and highly-efficient. Specifically, OPTQ can quantize GPT models with 175 billion parameters in approximately four GPU hours, reducing the bitwidth down to 3 or 4 bits per weight, with negligible accuracy degradation relative to the uncompressed baseline. Our method more than doubles the compression gains relative to previously-proposed one-shot quantization methods, preserving accuracy, allowing us for the first time to execute an 175 billion-parameter model inside a single GPU for generative inference. Moreover, we also show that our method can still provide reasonable accuracy in the extreme quantization regime, in which weights are quantized to 2-bit or even ternary quantization levels. We show experimentally that these improvements can be leveraged for end-to-end inference speedups over FP16, of around 3.25x when using high-end GPUs (NVIDIA A100) and 4.5x when using more cost-effective ones (NVIDIA A6000).

    "abstract": "For full-batch gradient descent (GD), it has been empirically shown that the sharpness, the top eigenvalue of the Hessian, increases and then hovers above $2/\\text{(learning rate)}$, and this is called ``the edge of stability'' phenomenon. However, it is unclear why the sharpness is somewhat larger than $2/\\text{(learning rate)}$ and how this can be extended to general mini-batch stochastic gradient descent (SGD). We propose a new sharpness measure (interaction-aware-sharpness) aware of the \\emph{interaction} between the batch gradient distribution and the loss landscape geometry. This leads to a more refined and general characterization of the edge of stability for SGD. Moreover, based on the analysis of a concentration measure of the batch gradient, we propose a more accurate scaling rule, Linear and Saturation Scaling Rule (LSSR), between batch size and learning rate",

    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "We propose a method for 3D shape reconstruction from unoriented point clouds. Our method consists of a novel SE(3)-equivariant coordinate-based network (TF-ONet), that parametrizes the occupancy field of the shape and respects the inherent symmetries of the problem. In contrast to previous shape reconstruction methods that align the input to a regular grid, we operate directly on the irregular point cloud. Our architecture leverages equivariant attention layers that operate on local tokens. This mechanism enables local shape modelling, a crucial property for scalability to large scenes. Given an unoriented, sparse, noisy point cloud as input, we produce equivariant features for each point. These serve as keys and values for the subsequent equivariant cross-attention blocks that parametrize the occupancy field. By querying an arbitrary point in space, we predict its occupancy score. We show that our method outperforms previous SO(3)-equivariant methods, as well as non-equivariant methods trained on SO(3)-augmented datasets. More importantly, local modelling together with SE(3)-equivariance create an ideal setting for SE(3) scene reconstruction. We show that by training only on single, aligned objects and without any pre-segmentation, we can reconstruct novel scenes containing arbitrarily many objects in random poses without any performance loss",

This paper studies continual pre-training of LMs, in particular, continual domain-adaptive pre-training (or continual DAP-training). Existing research has shown that further pre-training an LM using a domain corpus to adapt the LM to the domain can improve the end-task performance in the domain. This paper proposes a novel method to continually DAP-train an LM with a sequence of unlabeled domain corpora to adapt the LM to these domains to improve their end-task performances. The key novelty of our method is a soft-masking mechanism that directly controls the update to the LM. A novel proxy is also proposed to preserve the general knowledge in the original LM. Additionally, it contrasts the representations of the previously learned domain knowledge (including the general knowledge in the pre-trained LM) and the knowledge from the current full network to achieve knowledge integration. The method not only overcomes catastrophic forgetting, but also achieves knowledge transfer to improve end-task performances.

However, in theory, due to the highly non-convex, non-concave landscape of the minmax training objective, GAN remains one of the least understood deep learning models. In this work, we formally study how GANs can efficiently learn certain hierarchically generated distributions that are close to the distribution of real-life images. We prove that when a distribution has a structure that we refer to as \\emph{forward super-resolution}, then simply training generative adversarial networks using stochastic gradient descent ascent (SGDA) can learn this distribution efficiently, both in sample and time complexities. We also provide empirical evidence that our assumption ``forward super-resolution'' is very natural in practice, and the underlying learning mechanisms that we study in this paper (to allow us efficiently train GAN via GDA in theory) simulates the actual learning process of GANs on real-world problems",

    "abstract": "Mobile UI understanding is important for enabling various interaction tasks such as UI automation and accessibility. Previous mobile UI modeling often depends on the view hierarchy information of a screen, which directly provides the structural data of the UI, with the hope to bypass challenging tasks of visual modeling from screen pixels. However, view hierarchies are not always available, and are often corrupted with missing object descriptions or misaligned structure information. As a result, despite the use of view hierarchies could offer short-term gains, it may ultimately hinder the applicability and performance of the model. In this paper, we propose Spotlight, a vision-only approach for mobile UI understanding. Specifically, we enhance a vision-language model that only takes the screenshot of the UI and a region of interest on the screen---the focus---as the input. This general architecture of Spotlight is easily scalable and capable of performing a range of UI modeling tasks. Our experiments show that our model establishes SoTA results on several representative UI tasks and outperforms previous methods that use both screenshots and view hierarchies as inputs. Furthermore, we explore multi-task learning and few-shot prompting capacities of the proposed models, demonstrating promising results in the multi-task learning direction",

Large deep networks have become increasingly effective at modeling complex video data in a self-supervised manner, as evaluated by metrics based on human perceptual similarity or pixel-wise comparison. However, it remains unclear whether current metrics are accurate indicators of performance on downstream tasks. We find empirically that for planning robotic manipulation, existing metrics can be unreliable at predicting execution success. To address this, we propose a benchmark for action-conditioned video prediction in the form of a control benchmark that evaluates a given model for simulated robotic manipulation through sampling-based planning. Our benchmark, Video Prediction for Visual Planning ($\\text{VP}^2$), includes simulated environments with $11$ task categories and $310$ task instance definitions, a full planning implementation, and training datasets containing scripted interaction trajectories for each task category. A central design goal of our benchmark is to expose a simple interface -- a single forward prediction call -- so it is straightforward to evaluate almost any action-conditioned video prediction model. We then leverage our benchmark to study the effects of scaling model size, quantity of training data, and model ensembling by analyzing five highly-performant video prediction models, finding that while scale can improve perceptual quality when modelling visually diverse settings, other attributes such as uncertainty awareness can also aid planning performance",

While global minimization of the PDE residual over the network parameters works well for boundary value problems, catastrophic forgetting impairs applicability to initial value problems (IVPs). In an alternative local-in-time approach, the optimization problem can be converted into an ordinary differential equation (ODE) on the network parameters and the solution propagated forward in time; however, we demonstrate that current methods based on this approach suffer from two key issues. First, following the ODE produces an uncontrolled growth in the conditioning of the problem, ultimately leading to unacceptably large numerical errors. Second, as the ODE methods scale cubically with the number of model parameters, they are restricted to small neural networks, significantly limiting their ability to represent intricate PDE initial conditions and solutions. Building on these insights, we develop Neural-IVP, an ODE based IVP solver which prevents the network from getting ill-conditioned and runs in time linear in the number of parameters, enabling us to evolve the dynamics of challenging PDEs with neural networks",

    "abstract": "The success of the Adam optimizer on a wide array of architectures has made it the default in settings where stochastic gradient descent (SGD) performs poorly. However, our theoretical understanding of this discrepancy is lagging, preventing the development of significant improvements on either algorithm. Recent work advances the hypothesis that Adam and other heuristics like gradient clipping outperform SGD on language tasks because the distribution of the error induced by sampling has heavy tails. This suggests that Adam outperform SGD because it uses a more robust gradient estimate. We evaluate this hypothesis by varying the batch size, up to the entire dataset, to control for stochasticity. We present evidence that stochasticity and heavy-tailed noise are not major factors in the performance gap between SGD and Adam. Rather, Adam performs better as the batch size increases, while SGD is less effective at taking advantage of the reduction in noise. This raises the question as to why Adam outperforms SGD in the full-batch setting. Through further investigation of simpler variants of SGD, we find that the behavior of Adam with large batches is similar to sign descent with momentum",

    "title": "Building Normalizing Flows with Stochastic Interpolants",
    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "A generative model based on a continuous-time normalizing flow between any pair of base and target probability densities is proposed. The velocity field of this flow is inferred from the probability current of a time-dependent density that interpolates between the base and the target in finite time. Unlike conventional normalizing flow inference methods based the maximum likelihood principle, which require costly backpropagation through ODE solvers, our interpolant approach leads to a simple quadratic loss for the velocity itself which is expressed in terms of expectations that are readily amenable to empirical estimation. The flow can be used to generate samples from either the base or target, and to estimate the likelihood at any time along the interpolant. In addition, the flow can be optimized to minimize the path length of the interpolant density, thereby paving the way for building optimal transport maps. In situations where the base is a Gaussian density, we also show that the velocity of our normalizing flow can also be used to construct a diffusion model to sample the target as well as estimate its score. However, our approach shows that we can bypass this diffusion completely and work at the level of the probability flow with greater simplicity, opening an avenue for methods based solely on ordinary differential equations as an alternative to those based on stochastic differential equations. Benchmarking on density estimation tasks illustrates that the learned flow can match and surpass conventional continuous flows at a fraction of the cost, and compares well with diffusions on image generation on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet $32 \\times 32$. The method scales ab-initio ODE flows to previously unreachable image resolutions, demonstrated up to $128\\times128$",

    "title": "Dual Student Networks for Data-Free Model Stealing",
    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "Data-free model stealing aims to replicate a target model without direct access to either the training data or the target model. To accomplish this, existing methods use a generator to produce samples in order to train a student model to match the target model outputs. To this end, the two main challenges are estimating gradients of the target model without access to its parameters, and generating a diverse set of training samples that thoroughly explores the input space. We propose a Dual Student method where two students are symmetrically trained in order to provide the generator a criterion to generate samples that the two students disagree on. On one hand, disagreement on a sample implies at least one student has classified the sample incorrectly when compared to the target model. This incentive towards disagreement implicitly encourages the generator to explore more diverse regions of the input space. On the other hand, our method utilizes gradients of student models to indirectly estimate gradients of the target model. We show that this novel training objective for the generator network is equivalent to optimizing a lower bound on the generator's loss if we had access to the target model gradients. In other words, our method alters the standard data-free model stealing paradigm by substituting the target model with a separate student model, thereby creating a lower bound which can be directly optimized without additional target model queries or separate synthetic datasets. We show that our new optimization framework provides more accurate gradient estimation of the target model and better accuracies on benchmark classification datasets. Additionally, our approach balances improved query efficiency with training computation cost. Finally, we demonstrate that our method serves as a better proxy model for transfer-based adversarial attacks than existing data-free model stealing methods",

    "abstract": "Devising a fair classifier that does not discriminate against different groups is an important problem in machine learning. Although researchers have proposed various ways of defining group fairness, most of them only focused on the immediate fairness, ignoring the long-term impact of a fair classifier under the dynamic scenario where each individual can improve its feature over time. Such dynamic scenarios happen in real world, e.g., college admission and credit loaning, where each rejected sample makes effort to change its features to get accepted afterwards. In this dynamic setting, the long-term fairness should equalize the samples' feature distribution across different groups after the rejected samples make some effort to improve. In order to promote long-term fairness, we propose a new fairness notion called Equal Improvability (EI), which equalizes the potential acceptance rate of the rejected samples across different groups assuming a bounded level of effort will be spent by each rejected sample. We analyze the properties of EI and its connections with existing fairness notions. To find a classifier that satisfies the EI requirement, we propose and study three different approaches that solve EI regularized optimization problems. Through experiments on both synthetic and real datasets, we demonstrate that the proposed EI-regularized algorithms encourage us to find a fair classifier in terms of EI. Finally, we provide experimental results on dynamic scenarios which highlight the advantages of our EI metric in achieving the long-term fairness. Codes are available in anonymous GitHub repository",

We present an adversarial approach that overcomes this limitation, which we call competitive PINNs (CPINNs). CPINNs train a discriminator that is rewarded for predicting mistakes the PINN makes. The discriminator and PINN participate in a zero-sum game with the exact PDE solution as an optimal strategy. This approach avoids squaring the large condition numbers of PDE discretizations, which is the likely reason for failures of previous attempts to decrease PINN errors even on benign problems. Numerical experiments on a Poisson problem show that CPINNs achieve errors four orders of magnitude smaller than the best-performing PINN. We observe relative errors on the order of single-precision accuracy, consistently decreasing with each epoch.

    "abstract": "Few-shot prompting is a surprisingly powerful way to use Large Language Models (LLMs) to solve various tasks. However, this approach struggles as the task complexity increases or when the individual reasoning steps of the task themselves are hard to learn, especially when embedded in more complex tasks. To address this, we propose Decomposed Prompting, a new approach to solve complex tasks by decomposing them (via prompting) into simpler sub-tasks that can be delegated to a library of prompting-based LLMs dedicated to these sub-tasks. This modular structure allows each prompt to be optimized for its specific sub-task, further decomposed if necessary, and even easily replaced with more effective prompts, trained models, or symbolic functions if desired. We show that the flexibility and modularity of Decomposed Prompting allows it to outperform prior work on few-shot prompting using GPT3. On symbolic reasoning tasks, we can further decompose sub-tasks that are hard for LLMs into even simpler solvable sub-tasks. When the complexity comes from the input length, we can recursively decompose the task into the same task but with smaller inputs. We also evaluate our approach on textual multi-step reasoning tasks: on long-context multi-hop QA task, we can more effectively teach the sub-tasks via our separate sub-tasks prompts; and on open-domain multi-hop QA, we can incorporate a symbolic information retrieval within our decomposition framework, leading to improved performance on both tasks.

    "abstract": "As data becomes increasingly vital, a company would be very cautious about releasing data, because the competitors could use it to train high-performance models, thereby posing a tremendous threat to the company's commercial competence. To prevent training good models on the data, we could add imperceptible perturbations to it. Since such perturbations aim at hurting the entire training process, they should reflect the vulnerability of DNN training, rather than that of a single model. Based on this new idea, we seek perturbed examples that are always unrecognized (never correctly classified) in training. In this paper, we uncover them by model checkpoints' gradients, forming the proposed self-ensemble protection (SEP), which is very effective because (1) learning on examples ignored during normal training tends to yield DNNs ignoring normal examples; (2) checkpoints' cross-model gradients are close to orthogonal, meaning that they are as diverse as DNNs with different architectures. That is, our amazing performance of ensemble only requires the computation of training one model. By extensive experiments with 9 baselines on 3 datasets and 5 architectures, SEP is verified to be a new state-of-the-art, e.g., our small $\\ell_\\infty=2/255$ perturbations reduce the accuracy of a CIFAR-10 ResNet18 from 94.56% to 14.68%, compared to 41.35% by the best-known method.

    "abstract": "Time series modeling is a well-established problem, which often requires that methods (1) expressively represent complicated dependencies, (2) forecast long horizons, and (3) efficiently train over long sequences. State-space models (SSMs) are classical models for time series, and prior works combine SSMs with deep learning layers for efficient sequence modeling. However, we find fundamental limitations with these prior approaches, proving their SSM representations cannot express autoregressive time series processes. We thus introduce SpaceTime, a new state-space time series architecture that improves all three criteria. For expressivity, we propose a new SSM parameterization based on the companion matrix---a canonical representation for discrete-time processes---which enables SpaceTime's SSM layers to learn desirable autoregressive processes. For long horizon forecasting, we introduce a \"closed-loop\" variation of the companion SSM, which enables SpaceTime to predict many future time-steps by generating its own layer-wise inputs. For efficient training and inference, we introduce an algorithm that reduces the memory and compute of a forward pass with the companion matrix. With sequence length $\\ell$ and state-space size $d$, we go from $\\tilde{O}(d \\ell)$ naïvely to $\\tilde{O}(d + \\ell)$. In experiments, our contributions lead to state-of-the-art results on extensive and diverse benchmarks, with best or second-best AUROC on 6 / 7 ECG and speech time series classification, and best MSE on 14 / 16 Informer forecasting tasks. Furthermore, we find SpaceTime (1) fits AR($p$) processes that prior deep SSMs fail on, (2) forecasts notably more accurately on longer horizons than prior state-of-the-art, and (3) speeds up training on real-world ETTh1 data by 73% and 80% relative wall-clock time over Transformers and LSTMs",

Patching design naturally has three-fold benefit: local semantic information is retained in the embedding; computation and memory usage of the attention maps are quadratically reduced given the same look-back window; and the model can attend longer history. Our channel-independent patch time series Transformer (PatchTST) can improve the long-term forecasting accuracy significantly when compared with that of SOTA Transformer-based models.

    "title": "Fantastic Rewards and How to Tame Them: A Case Study on Reward Learning for Task-oriented Dialogue Systems",
    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "When learning task-oriented dialogue (ToD) agents, reinforcement learning (RL) techniques can naturally be utilized to train dialogue strategies to achieve user-specific goals. Prior works mainly focus on adopting advanced RL techniques to train the ToD agents, while the design of the reward function is not well studied. This paper aims at answering the question of how to efficiently learn and leverage a reward function for training end-to-end (E2E) ToD agents. Specifically, we introduce two generalized objectives for reward-function learning, inspired by the classical learning-to-rank literature. Further, we utilize the learned reward function to guide the training of the E2E ToD agent. With the proposed techniques, we achieve competitive results on the E2E response-generation task on the Multiwoz 2.0 dataset.

    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "Despite the popularity and efficacy of knowledge distillation, there is limited understanding of why it helps. In order to study the generalization behavior of a distilled student, we propose a new theoretical framework that leverages supervision complexity: a measure of alignment between teacher-provided supervision and the student's neural tangent kernel. The framework highlights a delicate interplay among the teacher's accuracy, the student's margin with respect to the teacher predictions, and the complexity of the teacher predictions. Specifically, it provides a rigorous justification for the utility of various techniques that are prevalent in the context of distillation, such as early stopping and temperature scaling. Our analysis further suggests the use of online distillation, where a student receives increasingly more complex supervision from teachers in different stages of their training. We demonstrate efficacy of online distillation and validate the theoretical findings on a range of image classification benchmarks and model architectures",

    "abstract": "With more people publishing their personal data online, unauthorized data usage has become a serious concern. The unlearnable examples strategies have been introduced to prevent third parties from training on the data without permission. They add perturbations to the users' data before publishing, so as to make the models trained on the perturbed published dataset invalidated. These perturbations have been generated for a specific training setting and a target dataset. However, their unlearnable effects significantly decrease when used in other training settings or datasets. To tackle this issue, we propose a novel unlearnable strategy based on Class-wise Separability Discriminant (CSD), which boosts the transferability of the unlearnable perturbations by enhancing the linear separability. Extensive experiments demonstrate the transferability of the unlearnable examples crafted by our proposed method across training settings and datasets",

    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "Due to its geometric properties, hyperbolic space can support high-fidelity embeddings of tree- and graph-structured data, upon which various hyperbolic networks have been developed. Existing hyperbolic networks encode geometric priors not only for the input, but also at every layer of the network. This approach involves repeatedly mapping to and from hyperbolic space, which makes these networks complicated to implement, computationally expensive to scale, and numerically unstable to train. In this paper, we propose a simpler approach: learn a hyperbolic embedding of the input, then map once from it to Euclidean space using a mapping that encodes geometric priors by respecting the isometries of hyperbolic space, and finish with a standard Euclidean network. The key insight is to use a random feature mapping via the eigenfunctions of the Laplace operator, which we show can approximate any isometry-invariant kernel on hyperbolic space. Our method can be used together with any graph neural networks: using even a linear graph model yields significant improvements in both efficiency and performance over other hyperbolic baselines in both transductive and inductive tasks",

Existing techniques such as reweighted sampling, episodic learning and reverse sweep update further process the information in the replay memory to make experience replay more efficient. In this work, we further exploit the information in the replay memory by treating it as an empirical \\emph{Replay Memory MDP (RM-MDP)}. By solving it with dynamic programming, we learn a conservative value estimate that \\emph{only} considers transitions observed in the replay memory. Both value and policy regularizers based on this conservative estimate are developed and integrated with model-free learning algorithms. We design the metric \\textit{memory density} to measure the quality of RM-MDP. Our empirical studies quantitatively find a strong correlation between performance improvement and memory density. Our method combines \\emph{Conservative Estimation with Experience Replay (CEER)}, improving sample efficiency by a large margin, especially when the memory density is high. Even when the memory density is low, such a conservative estimate can still help to avoid suicidal actions and thereby improve performance",

    "title": "TextGrad: Advancing Robustness Evaluation in NLP by Gradient-Driven Optimization",
    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "Robustness evaluation against adversarial examples has become increasingly important to unveil the trustworthiness of the prevailing deep models in natural language processing (NLP). However, in contrast to the computer vision domain where the first-order projected gradient descent (PGD) is used as the benchmark approach to generate adversarial examples for robustness evaluation, there lacks a principled first-order gradient-based robustness evaluation framework in NLP. The emerging optimization challenges lie in 1) the discrete nature of textual inputs together with the strong coupling between the perturbation location and the actual content, and 2) the additional constraint that the perturbed text should be fluent and achieve a low perplexity under a language model. These challenges make the development of PGD-like NLP attacks difficult. To bridge the gap, we propose TextGrad, a new attack generator using gradient-driven optimization, supporting high-accuracy and high-quality assessment of adversarial robustness in NLP. Specifically, we address the aforementioned challenges in a unified optimization framework. And we develop an effective convex relaxation method to co-optimize the continuously-relaxed site selection and perturbation variables and leverage an effective sampling method to establish an accurate mapping from the continuous optimization variables to the discrete textual perturbations. Moreover, as a first-order attack generation method, TextGrad can be baked into adversarial training to further improve the robustness of NLP models. Extensive experiments are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of TextGrad not only in attack generation for robustness evaluation but also in adversarial defense. From the attack perspective, we show that TextGrad achieves remarkable improvements in both the attack success rate and the perplexity score over five state-of-the-art baselines. From the defense perspective, TextGrad-enabled adversarial training yields the most robust NLP model against a wide spectrum of NLP attacks",

    "abstract": "Many policy gradient methods are variants of Actor-Critic (AC), where a value function (critic) is learned to facilitate updating the parameterized policy (actor). The update to the actor involves a log-likelihood update weighted by the action-values, with the addition of entropy regularization for soft variants. In this work, we explore an alternative update for the actor, based on an extension of the cross entropy method (CEM) to condition on inputs (states). The idea is to start with a broader policy and slowly concentrate around maximal actions, using a maximum likelihood update towards actions in the top percentile per state. The speed of this concentration is controlled by a proposal policy, that concentrates at a slower rate than the actor. We first provide a policy improvement result in an idealized setting, and then prove that our conditional CEM (CCEM) strategy tracks a CEM update per state, even with changing action-values. We empirically show that our Greedy AC algorithm, that uses CCEM for the actor update, performs better than Soft Actor-Critic and is much less sensitive to entropy-regularization",

    "title": "Efficiently Controlling Multiple Risks with Pareto Testing",
    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "Machine learning applications frequently come with multiple diverse objectives and constraints that can change over time. Accordingly, trained models can be tuned with sets of hyper-parameters that affect their predictive behavior (e.g., their run-time efficiency versus error rate). As the number of constraints and hyper-parameter dimensions grow, naively selected settings may lead to sub-optimal and/or unreliable results. We develop an efficient method for calibrating models such that their predictions provably satisfy multiple explicit and simultaneous statistical guarantees (e.g., upper-bounded error rates), while also optimizing any number of additional, unconstrained objectives (e.g., total run-time cost). Building on recent results in distribution-free, finite-sample risk control for general losses, we propose Pareto Testing: a two-stage process which combines multi-objective optimization with multiple hypothesis testing. The optimization stage constructs a set of promising combinations on the Pareto frontier. We then apply statistical testing to this frontier only to identify configurations that have (a) high utility with respect to our objectives, and (b) guaranteed risk levels with respect to our constraints, with specifiably high probability. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach to reliably accelerate the execution of large-scale Transformer models in natural language processing (NLP) applications. In particular, we show how Pareto Testing can be used to dynamically configure multiple inter-dependent model attributes—including the number of layers computed before exiting, number of attention heads pruned, or number of text tokens considered—to simultaneously control and optimize various accuracy and cost metrics",

A major limitation of the DM is its notoriously slow sampling procedure which normally requires hundreds to thousands of time discretization steps of the learned diffusion process to reach the desired accuracy. Our goal is to develop a fast sampling method for DMs with a much less number of steps while retaining high sample quality. To this end, we systematically analyze the sampling procedure in DMs and identify key factors that affect the sample quality, among which the method of discretization is most crucial. By carefully examining the learned diffusion process, we propose Diffusion Exponential Integrator Sampler~(DEIS). It is based on the Exponential Integrator designed for discretizing ordinary differential equations (ODEs) and leverages a semilinear structure of the learned diffusion process to reduce the discretization error. The proposed method can be applied to any DMs and can generate high-fidelity samples in as few as 10 steps. Moreover, by directly using pre-trained DMs, we achieve state-of-art sampling performance when the number of score function evaluation~(NFE) is limited, e.g., 4.17 FID with 10 NFEs, 2.86 FID with only 20 NFEs on CIFAR10",

    "abstract": "Biological neural networks are capable of recruiting different sets of neurons to encode different memories. However, when training artificial neural networks on a set of tasks, typically, no mechanism is employed for selectively producing anything analogous to these neuronal ensembles. Further, artificial neural networks suffer from catastrophic forgetting, where the network's performance rapidly deteriorates as tasks are learned sequentially. By contrast, sequential learning is possible for a range of biological organisms. We introduce Learned Context Dependent Gating (LXDG), a method to flexibly allocate and recall `artificial neuronal ensembles', using a particular network structure and a new set of regularization terms. Activities in the hidden layers of the network are modulated by gates, which are dynamically produced during training. The gates are outputs of networks themselves, trained with a sigmoid output activation. The regularization terms we have introduced correspond to properties exhibited by biological neuronal ensembles. The first term penalizes low gate sparsity, ensuring that only a specified fraction of the network is used. The second term ensures that previously learned gates are recalled when the network is presented with input from previously learned tasks. Finally, there is a regularization term responsible for ensuring that new tasks are encoded in gates that are as orthogonal as possible from previously used ones. We demonstrate the ability of this method to alleviate catastrophic forgetting on continual learning benchmarks. When the new regularization terms are included in the model along with Elastic Weight Consolidation (EWC) it achieves better performance on the benchmark `permuted MNIST' than with EWC alone. The benchmark `rotated MNIST' demonstrates how similar tasks recruit similar neurons to the artificial neuronal ensemble",

    "abstract": "Certified robustness in machine learning has primarily focused on adversarial perturbations with a fixed attack budget for each sample in the input distribution. In this work, we present provable robustness guarantees on the accuracy of a model under bounded Wasserstein shifts of the data distribution. We show that a simple procedure that randomizes the input of the model within a transformation space is provably robust to distributional shifts under that transformation. Our framework allows the datum-specific perturbation size to vary across different points in the input distribution and is general enough to include fixed-sized perturbations as well. Our certificates produce guaranteed lower bounds on the performance of the model for any shift (natural or adversarial) of the input distribution within a Wasserstein ball around the original distribution. We apply our technique to certify robustness against natural (non-adversarial) transformations of images such as color shifts, hue shifts, and changes in brightness and saturation. We obtain strong performance guarantees for the robust model under clearly visible shifts in the input images. Our experiments establish the non-vacuousness of our certificates by showing that the certified lower bound on a robust model's accuracy is higher than the empirical accuracy of an undefended model under a distribution shift. Moreover, our results also imply guaranteed lower bounds (hardness result) on the performance of models trained on so-called \"unlearnable\" datasets that have been poisoned to interfere with model training. We show that the performance of a robust model is guaranteed to remain above a certain threshold on the test distribution even when the base model is trained on the poisoned dataset",

    "title": "How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love Retraining",
    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "Many Neural Network Pruning approaches consist of several iterative training and pruning steps, seemingly losing a significant amount of their performance after pruning and then recovering it in the subsequent retraining phase. Recent works of Renda et al. (2020) and Le & Hua (2021) demonstrate the significance of the learning rate schedule during the retraining phase and propose specific heuristics for choosing such a schedule for IMP (Han et al., 2015). We place these findings in the context of the results of Li et al. (2020) regarding the training of models within a fixed training budget and demonstrate that, consequently, the retraining phase can be massively shortened using a simple linear learning rate schedule. Improving on existing retraining approaches, we additionally propose a method to adaptively select the initial value of the linear schedule. Going a step further, we propose similarly imposing a budget on the initial dense training phase and show that the resulting simple and efficient method is capable of outperforming significantly more complex or heavily parameterized state-of-the-art approaches that attempt to sparsify the network during training. These findings not only advance our understanding of the retraining phase, but more broadly question the belief that one should aim to avoid the need for retraining and reduce the negative effects of ‘hard' pruning by incorporating the sparsification process into the standard training",

    "title": "Interpretable Geometric Deep Learning via Learnable Randomness Injection",
    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "Point cloud data is ubiquitous in scientific fields. Recently, geometric deep learning (GDL) has been widely applied to solve prediction tasks with such data. However, GDL models are often complicated and hardly interpretable, which poses concerns to scientists who are to deploy these models in scientific analysis and experiments. This work proposes a general mechanism, learnable randomness injection (LRI), which allows building inherently interpretable models based on general GDL backbones. LRI-induced models, once trained, can detect the points in the point cloud data that carry information indicative of the prediction label. We also propose four datasets from real scientific applications that cover the domains of high-energy physics and biochemistry to evaluate the LRI mechanism. Compared with previous post-hoc interpretation methods, the points detected by LRI align much better and stabler with the ground-truth patterns that have actual scientific meanings. LRI is grounded by the information bottleneck principle, and thus LRI-induced models are also more robust to distribution shifts between training and test scenarios.

    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "Real-world machine learning applications often involve deploying neural networks to domains that are not seen in the training time. Hence, we need to understand the extrapolation of \\textit{nonlinear} models---under what conditions on the distributions and function class, models can be guaranteed to extrapolate to new test distributions. The question is very challenging because even two-layer neural networks cannot be guaranteed to extrapolate outside the support of the training distribution without further assumptions on the domain shift. This paper makes some initial steps towards analyzing the extrapolation of nonlinear models for structured domain shift. We primarily consider settings where the \\textit{marginal} distribution of each coordinate of the data (or subset of coordinates) do not shift significantly across the training and test distributions, but the joint distribution may have a much bigger shift. We prove that the family of nonlinear models of the form $f(x)=\\sum f_i(x_i)$, where $f_i$ is an \\emph{arbitrary} function on the subset of features $x_i$, can extrapolate to unseen distributions, if the covariance of the features is well-conditioned. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first result that goes beyond linear models and the bounded density ratio assumption, even though the assumptions on the distribution shift and function class are stylized",

    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "Despite recent advancements in language models (LMs), their application to dialogue management (DM) problems and ability to carry on rich conversations remain a challenge. We use reinforcement learning (RL) to develop a dialogue agent that avoids being short-sighted (outputting generic utterances) and maximizes overall user satisfaction. Most existing RL approaches to DM train the agent at the word-level, and thus, have to deal with a combinatorially complex action space even for a medium-size vocabulary. As a result, they struggle to produce a successful and engaging dialogue even if they are warm-started with a pre-trained LM. To address this issue, we develop a RL-based DM using a novel mixture of expert language model (MoE-LM) that consists of (i) a LM capable of learning diverse semantics for conversation histories, (ii) a number of specialized LMs (or experts) capable of generating utterances corresponding to a particular attribute or personality, and (iii) a RL-based DM that performs dialogue planning with the utterances generated by the experts. Our MoE approach provides greater flexibility to generate sensible utterances with different intents and allows RL to focus on conversational-level DM. We compare it with SOTA baselines on open-domain dialogues and demonstrate its effectiveness both in terms of the diversity and sensibility of the generated utterances and the overall DM performance",

    "title": "f-DM: A Multi-stage Diffusion Model via Progressive Signal Transformation",
    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "Diffusion models (DMs) have recently emerged as SoTA tools for generative modeling in various domains. Standard DMs can be viewed as an instantiation of hierarchical variational autoencoders (VAEs) where the latent variables are inferred from input-centered Gaussian distributions with fixed scales and variances. Unlike VAEs, this formulation constrains DMs from changing the latent spaces and learning abstract representations. In this work, we propose f-DM, a generalized family of DMs which allows progressive signal transformation. More precisely, we extend DMs to incorporate a set of (hand-designed or learned) transformations, where the transformed input is the mean of each diffusion step. We propose a generalized formulation and derive the corresponding de-noising objective with a modified sampling algorithm. As a demonstration, we apply f-DM in image generation tasks with a range of functions, including down-sampling, blurring, and learned transformations based on the encoder of pretrained VAEs. In addition, we identify the importance of adjusting the noise levels whenever the signal is sub-sampled and propose a simple rescaling recipe. f-DM can produce high-quality samples on standard image generation benchmarks like FFHQ, AFHQ, LSUN, and ImageNet with better efficiency and semantic interpretation",

    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "How the brain performs credit assignment is a fundamental unsolved problem in neuroscience. Many `biologically plausible' algorithms have been proposed, which compute gradients that approximate those computed by backpropagation (BP), and which operate in ways that more closely satisfy the constraints imposed by neural circuitry. Many such algorithms utilize the framework of energy-based models (EBMs), in which all free variables in the model are optimized to minimize a global energy function. However, in the literature, these algorithms exist in isolation and no unified theory exists linking them together. Here, we provide a comprehensive theory of the conditions under which EBMs can approximate BP, which lets us unify many of the BP approximation results in the literature (namely, predictive coding, equilibrium propagation, and contrastive Hebbian learning) and demonstrate that their approximation to BP arises from a simple and general mathematical property of EBMs at free-phase equilibrium. This property can then be exploited in different ways with different energy functions, and these specific choices yield a family of BP-approximating algorithms, which both includes the known results in the literature and can be used to derive new ones",

    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "Predictive coding (PC) is an influential theory in computational neuroscience, which argues that the cortex forms unsupervised world models by implementing a hierarchical process of prediction error minimization. PC networks (PCNs) are trained in two phases. First, neural activities are updated to optimize the network's response to external stimuli. Second, synaptic weights are updated to consolidate this change in activity --- an algorithm called \\emph{prospective configuration}. While previous work has shown how in various limits, PCNs can be found to approximate backpropagation (BP), recent work has demonstrated that PCNs operating in this standard regime, which does not approximate BP, nevertheless obtain competitive training and generalization performance to BP-trained networks while outperforming them on various tasks. However, little is understood theoretically about the properties and dynamics of PCNs in this regime. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive theoretical analysis of the properties of PCNs trained with prospective configuration. We first derive analytical results concerning the inference equilibrium for PCNs and a previously unknown close connection relationship to target propagation (TP). Secondly, we provide a theoretical analysis of learning in PCNs as a variant of generalized expectation-maximization and use that to prove the convergence of PCNs to critical points of the BP loss function, thus showing that deep PCNs can, in theory, achieve the same generalization performance as BP, while maintaining their unique advantages",

    "abstract": "For small training set sizes $P$, the generalization error of wide neural networks is well-approximated by the error of an infinite width neural network (NN), either in the kernel or mean-field/feature-learning regime. However, after a critical sample size $P^*$, we empirically find the finite-width network generalization becomes worse than that of the infinite width network. In this work, we empirically study the transition from infinite-width behavior to this \\textit{variance-limited} regime as a function of sample size $P$ and network width $N$. We find that finite-size effects can become relevant for very small dataset sizes on the order of $P^* \\sim \\sqrt{N}$ for polynomial regression with ReLU networks. We discuss the source of these effects using an argument based on the variance of the NN's final neural tangent kernel (NTK). This transition can be pushed to larger $P$ by enhancing feature learning or by ensemble averaging the networks. We find that the learning curve for regression with the final NTK is an accurate approximation of the NN learning curve. Using this, we provide a toy model which also exhibits $P^* \\sim \\sqrt{N}$ scaling and has $P$-dependent benefits from feature learning",

    "abstract": "This paper targets at a new and challenging setting of knowledge transfer from multiple source domains to a single target domain, where target data is few shot or even one shot with label. Traditional domain generalization or adaptation methods cannot directly work since there is no sufficient target domain distribution serving as the transfer object. The multi-source setting further prevents the transfer task as excessive domain gap introduced from all the source domains. To tackle this problem, we newly propose a progressive mix-up (P-Mixup) mechanism to introduce an intermediate mix-up domain, pushing both the source domains and the few-shot target domain aligned to this mix-up domain. Further by enforcing the mix-up domain to progressively move towards the source domains, we achieve the domain transfer from multi-source domains to the single one-shot target domain. Our P-Mixup is different from traditional mix-up that ours is with a progressive and adaptive mix-up ratio, following the curriculum learning spirit to better align the source and target domains. Moreover, our P-Mixup combines both pixel-level and feature-level mix-up to better enrich the data diversity. Experiments on two benchmarks show that our P-Mixup significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods, i.e., 6.0\\% and 6.8\\% improvements on Office-Home and DomainNet",

    "abstract": "Learning logical rules is critical to improving reasoning in KGs. This is due to their ability to provide logical and interpretable explanations when used for predictions, as well as their ability to generalize to other tasks, domains, and data. While recent methods have been proposed to learn logical rules, the majority of these methods are either restricted by their computational complexity and can not handle the large search space of large-scale KGs, or show poor generalization when exposed to data outside the training set. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end neural model for learning compositional logical rules called NCRL. NCRL detects the best compositional structure of a rule body, and breaks it into small compositions in order to infer the rule head. By recurrently merging compositions in the rule body with a recurrent attention unit, NCRL finally predicts a single rule head. Experimental results show that NCRL learns high-quality rules, as well as being generalizable. Specifically, we show that NCRL is scalable, efficient, and yields state-of-the-art results for knowledge graph completion on large-scale KGs. Moreover, we test NCRL for systematic generalization by learning to reason on small-scale observed graphs and evaluating on larger unseen ones",

    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "Humans have been shown to use a ''straightened'' encoding to represent the natural visual world as it evolves in time (Henaff et al. 2019). In the context of discrete video sequences, ''straightened'' means that changes between frames follow a more linear path in representation space at progressively deeper levels of processing. While deep convolutional networks are often proposed as models of human visual processing, many do not straighten natural videos. In this paper, we explore the relationship between network architecture, differing types of robustness, biologically-inspired filtering mechanisms, and representational straightness in response to time-varying input; we identify strengths and limitations of straightness as a useful way of evaluating neural network representations. We find that (1) adversarial training leads to straighter representations in both CNN and transformer-based architectures but (2) this effect is task-dependent, not generalizing to tasks such as segmentation and frame-prediction, where straight representations are not favorable for predictions; and nor to other types of robustness. In addition, (3) straighter representations impart temporal stability to class predictions, even for out-of-distribution data. Finally, (4) biologically-inspired elements increase straightness in the early stages of a network, but do not guarantee increased straightness in downstream layers of CNNs. We show that straightness is an easily computed measure of representational robustness and stability, as well as a hallmark of human representations with benefits for computer vision models",

    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "One of the main motivations of studying continual learning is that the problem setting allows a model to accrue knowledge from past tasks to learn new tasks more efficiently. However, recent studies suggest that the key metric that continual learning algorithms optimize, reduction in catastrophic forgetting, does not correlate well with the forward transfer of knowledge. We believe that the conclusion previous works reached is due to the way they measure forward transfer. We argue that the measure of forward transfer to a task should not be affected by the restrictions placed on the continual learner in order to preserve knowledge of previous tasks. Instead, forward transfer should be measured by how easy it is to learn a new task given a set of representations produced by continual learning on previous tasks. Under this notion of forward transfer, we evaluate different continual learning algorithms on a variety of image classification benchmarks. Our results indicate that less forgetful representations lead to a better forward transfer suggesting a strong correlation between retaining past information and learning efficiency on new tasks. Further, we found less forgetful representations to be more diverse and discriminative compared to their forgetful counterparts",

    "abstract": "Existing models for learning representations in supervised classification problems are permutation invariant with respect to class labels. However, structured knowledge about the classes, such as hierarchical label structures, widely exists in many real-world datasets, e.g., the ImageNet and CIFAR benchmarks. How to learn representations that can preserve such structures among the classes remains an open problem. To approach this problem, given a tree of class hierarchy, we first define a tree metric between any pair of nodes in the tree to be the length of the shortest path connecting them. We then provide a method to learn the hierarchical relationship of class labels by approximately embedding the tree metric in the Euclidean space of features. More concretely, during supervised training, we propose to use the Cophenetic Correlation Coefficient (CPCC) as a regularizer for the cross-entropy loss to correlate the tree metric of classes and the Euclidean distance in the class-conditioned representations. Our proposed regularizer is computationally lightweight and easy to implement. Empirically, we demonstrate that this approach can help to learn more interpretable representations due to the preservation of the tree metric, and leads to better in-distribution generalization as well as under sub-population shifts over six real-world datasets",

    "title": "Promptagator: Few-shot Dense Retrieval From 8 Examples",
    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "Much recent research on information retrieval has focused on how to transfer from one task (typically with abundant supervised data) to various other retrieval tasks where supervision is limited, with the implicit assumption that it is possible to generalize from one task to all the rest. However, this overlooks the fact that there are many diverse and unique retrieval problems, each targeting different search intents, queries, and search domains. In this paper, we suggest to work on Few-shot Dense Retrieval, a setting where each task comes with a short description and a few examples. To address this, we introduce Prompt-based Query Generation forRetrieval (Promptagator): for each task, we feed the few-shot examples to a large language model (LLM) and prompt it to behave as a task-specific query generator. Using this, we can synthetically generate a large number of relevant queries for any document, yielding abundant data for training task-specific retrievers --- with no reliance on traditional resources such as Natural Questions (Kwiatkowskiet al., 2019) or MS MARCO (Nguyen et al., 2016).

Further training standard-size re-rankers using the same generated data yields another 5.0 points nDCG@10 improvement.

    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "Representational straightening refers to a decrease in curvature of visual feature representations of a sequence of frames taken from natural movies. Prior work established straightening in neural representations of the primate primary visual cortex (V1) and perceptual straightening in human behavior as a hallmark of biological vision in contrast to artificial feedforward neural networks which did not demonstrate this phenomenon as they were not explicitly optimized to produce temporally predictable movie representations. Here, we show robustness to noise in the input image can produce representational straightening in feedforward neural networks. Both adversarial training (AT) and base classifiers for Random Smoothing (RS) induced remarkably straightened feature codes. Demonstrating their utility within the domain of natural movies, these codes could be inverted to generate intervening movie frames by linear interpolation in the feature space even though they were not trained on these trajectories. Demonstrating their biological utility, we found that AT and RS training improved predictions of neural data in primate V1 over baseline models providing a parsimonious, bio-plausible mechanism -- noise in the sensory input stages -- for generating representations in early visual cortex. Finally, we compared the geometric properties of frame representations in these networks to better understand how they produced representations that mimicked the straightening phenomenon from biology. Overall, this work elucidating emergent properties of robust neural networks demonstrates that it is not necessary to utilize predictive objectives or train directly on natural movie statistics to achieve models supporting straightened movie representations similar to human perception that also predict V1 neural responses",

In real-world and large applications graph data are usually incomplete, motivating graph reasoning models for missing-fact or missing-relationship inference. While these models can achieve state-of-the-art performance, they require a large amount of training data. Recent years have witnessed the rising interest in label creation with data programming (DP) methods, which aim to generate training labels from heuristic labeling functions. However, existing methods typically focus on unstructured data and are not optimized for graphs. In this work, we propose LogicDP, a data programming framework for graph data. Unlike existing DP methods, (1) LogicDP utilizes the inductive logic programming (ILP) technique and automatically discovers the labeling functions from the graph data; (2) LogicDP employs a budget-aware framework to iteratively refine the functions by querying an oracle, which significantly reduces the human efforts in function creations. Experiments show that LogicDP achieves better data efficiency in both scene graph and knowledge graph reasoning tasks",

    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "Deep neural networks have been successful in many reinforcement learning settings. However, compared to human learners they are overly data hungry. To build a sample-efficient world model, we apply a transformer to real-world episodes in an autoregressive manner: not only the compact latent states and the taken actions but also the experienced or predicted rewards are fed into the transformer, so that it can attend flexibly to all three modalities at different time steps. The transformer allows our world model to access previous states directly, instead of viewing them through a compressed recurrent state. By utilizing the Transformer-XL architecture, it is able to learn long-term dependencies while staying computationally efficient. Our transformer-based world model (TWM) generates meaningful, new experience, which is used to train a policy that outperforms previous model-free and model-based reinforcement learning algorithms on the Atari 100k benchmark.

    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "Despite the success of neural network models in a range of domains, it remains an open question whether they can learn to represent abstract logical operators such as negation and disjunction. We test the hypothesis that neural networks without inherent inductive biases for logical reasoning can acquire an implicit representation of negation and disjunction. Here, implicit refers to limited, domain-specific forms of these operators, and work in psychology suggests these operators may be a precursor (developmentally and evolutionarily) to the type of abstract, domain-general logic that is characteristic of adult humans. To test neural networks, we adapt a test designed to diagnose the presence of negation and disjunction in animals and pre-verbal children, which requires inferring the location of a hidden object using constraints of the physical environment as well as implicit logic: if a ball is hidden in A or B, and shown not to be in A, can the subject infer that it is in B? Our results show that, despite the neural networks learning to track objects behind occlusion, they are unable to generalize to a task that requires implicit logic. We further show that models are unable to generalize to the test task even when they are trained directly on a logically identical (though visually dissimilar) task. However, experiments using transfer learning reveal that the models do recognize structural similarity between tasks which invoke the same logical reasoning pattern, suggesting that some desirable abstractions are learned, even if they are not yet sufficient to pass established tests of logical reasoning",

    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "Recent techniques for approximating Nash equilibria in very large games leverage neural networks to learn approximately optimal policies (strategies). One promis- ing line of research uses neural networks to approximate counterfactual regret minimization (CFR) or its modern variants. DREAM, the only current CFR-based neural method that is model free and therefore scalable to very large games, trains a neural network on an estimated regret target that can have extremely high variance due to an importance sampling term inherited from Monte Carlo CFR (MCCFR). In this paper we propose an unbiased model-free method that does not require any importance sampling. Our method, ESCHER, is principled and is guaranteed to converge to an approximate Nash equilibrium with high probability. We show that the variance of the estimated regret of ESCHER is orders of magnitude lower than DREAM and other baselines. We then show that ESCHER outperforms the prior state of the art—DREAM and neural fictitious self play (NFSP)—on a number of games and the difference becomes dramatic as game size increases. In the very large game of dark chess, ESCHER is able to beat DREAM and NFSP in a head-to-head competition over 90% of the time",

Applying these results along with new Rademacher complexity bounds for adversarial training near initialization, we prove that for general data distributions and perturbation sets, adversarial training on shallow networks with early stopping and an idealized optimal adversary is able to achieve optimal adversarial test error.

    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "We consider a setting that a model needs to adapt to a new domain under distribution shifts, given that only unlabeled test samples from the new domain are accessible at test time. A common idea in most of the related works is constructing pseudo-labels for the unlabeled test samples and applying gradient descent (GD) to a loss function with the pseudo-labels. Recently, Goyal et al. (2022) propose conjugate labels, which is a new kind of pseudo-labels for self-training at test time. They empirically show that the conjugate label outperforms other ways of pseudo-labeling on many domain adaptation benchmarks. However, provably showing that GD with conjugate labels learns a good classifier for test-time adaptation remains open. In this work, we aim at theoretically understanding GD with hard and conjugate labels for a binary classification problem. We show that for square loss, GD with conjugate labels converges to an $\\epsilon$-optimal predictor under a Gaussian model for any arbitrarily small $\\epsilon$, while GD with hard pseudo-labels fails in this task. We also analyze them under different loss functions for the update. Our results shed lights on understanding when and why GD with hard labels or conjugate labels works in test-time adaptation",

These models leverage compositional architectures which aim to learn specialized modules dedicated to structures in a task that can be composed to solve novel problems with similar structures. While the compositionality of these architectures is guaranteed by design, the modules specializing is not. Here we theoretically study the ability of network modules to specialize to useful structures in a dataset and achieve systematic generalization. To this end we introduce a minimal space of datasets motivated by practical systematic generalization benchmarks. From this space of datasets we present a mathematical definition of systematicity and study the learning dynamics of linear neural modules when solving components of the task. Our results shed light on the difficulty of module specialization, what is required for modules to successfully specialize, and the necessity of modular architectures to achieve systematicity.

This paper focuses on task-agnostic distillation. It produces a compact pre-trained model that can be easily fine-tuned on various tasks with small computational costs and memory footprints. Despite the practical benefits, task-agnostic distillation is challenging. Since the teacher model has a significantly larger capacity and stronger representation power than the student model, it is very difficult for the student to produce predictions that match the teacher's over a massive amount of open-domain training data. Such a large prediction discrepancy often diminishes the benefits of knowledge distillation. To address this challenge, we propose Homotopic Distillation (HomoDistil), a novel task-agnostic distillation approach equipped with iterative pruning. Specifically, we initialize the student model from the teacher model, and iteratively prune the student's neurons until the target width is reached. Such an approach maintains a small discrepancy between the teacher's and student's predictions throughout the distillation process, which ensures the effectiveness of knowledge transfer. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HomoDistil achieves significant improvements on existing baselines. Our codes will be released",

However, for many complex tasks, a demonstration or language instruction alone contains ambiguities, preventing tasks from being specified clearly. In such cases, a combination of both a demonstration and an instruction more concisely and effectively conveys the task to the robot than either modality alone. To instantiate this problem setting, we train a single multi-task policy on a few hundred challenging robotic pick-and-place tasks and propose DeL-TaCo (Joint Demo-Language Task Conditioning), a method for conditioning a robotic policy on task embeddings comprised of two components: a visual demonstration and a language instruction. By allowing these two modalities to mutually disambiguate and clarify each other during novel task specification, DeL-TaCo (1) substantially decreases the teacher effort needed to specify a new task and (2) achieves better generalization performance on novel objects and instructions over previous task-conditioning methods. To our knowledge, this is the first work to show that simultaneously conditioning a multi-task robotic manipulation policy on both demonstration and language embeddings improves sample efficiency and generalization over conditioning on either modality alone",

Our approach leverages this proxy reward function in an RL framework. Specifically, users specify a prompt once at the beginning of training. During training, the LLM evaluates an RL agent's behavior against the desired behavior described by the prompt and outputs a corresponding reward signal. The RL agent then uses this reward to update its behavior. We evaluate whether our approach can train agents aligned with user objectives in the Ultimatum Game, matrix games, and the DealOrNoDeal negotiation task. In all three tasks, we show that RL agents trained with our framework are well-aligned with the user's objectives and outperforms RL agents trained with reward functions learned via supervised learning",

    "abstract": "Contemporary applications of machine learning raise important and overlooked theoretical questions regarding optimization in two-team games. Formally, two-team zero-sum games are defined as multi-player games where players are split into two competing sets of agents, each experiencing a utility identical to that of their teammates and opposite to that of the opposing team. We focus on the solution concept of Nash equilibria and prove $\\textrm{CLS}$-hardness of computing them in this class of games. To further examine the capabilities of online learning algorithms in games with full-information feedback, we propose a benchmark of a simple ---yet nontrivial--- family of such games. These games do not enjoy the properties used to prove convergence for relevant algorithms. In particular, we use a dynamical systems perspective to demonstrate that gradient descent-ascent, its optimistic variant, optimistic multiplicative weights update, and extra gradient fail to converge (even locally) to a Nash equilibrium. On a brighter note, we propose a first-order method that leverages control theory techniques and under some conditions enjoys last-iterate local convergence to a Nash equilibrium. We also believe our proposed method is of independent interest for general min-max optimization",

While highly general, their learning dynamics are often times heuristic and inflexible — exactly the limitations that meta-learning can address. Hence, we propose to discover effective update rules for evolution strategies via meta-learning. Concretely, our approach employs a search strategy parametrized by a self-attention-based architecture, which guarantees the update rule is invariant to the ordering of the candidate solutions. We show that meta-evolving this system on a small set of representative low-dimensional analytic optimization problems is sufficient to discover new evolution strategies capable of generalizing to unseen optimization problems, population sizes and optimization horizons. Furthermore, the same learned evolution strategy can outperform established neuroevolution baselines on supervised and continuous control tasks. As additional contributions, we ablate the individual neural network components of our method; reverse engineer the learned strategy into an explicit heuristic form, which remains highly competitive; and show that it is possible to self-referentially train an evolution strategy from scratch, with the learned update rule used to drive the outer meta-learning loop",

    "title": "DensePure: Understanding Diffusion Models for Adversarial Robustness",
    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "Diffusion models have been recently employed to improve certified robustness through the process of denoising. However, the theoretical understanding of why diffusion models are able to improve the certified robustness is still lacking, preventing from further improvement. In this study, we close this gap by analyzing the fundamental properties of diffusion models and establishing the conditions under which they can enhance certified robustness. This deeper understanding allows us to propose a new method DensePure, designed to improve the certified robustness of a pretrained model (i.e. classifier). Given an (adversarial) input, DensePure consists of multiple runs of denoising via the reverse process of the diffusion model (with different random seeds) to get multiple reversed samples, which are then passed through the classifier, followed by majority voting of inferred labels to make the final prediction. This design of using multiple runs of denoising is informed by our theoretical analysis of the conditional distribution of the reversed sample. Specifically, when the data density of a clean sample is high, its conditional density under the reverse process in a diffusion model is also high; thus sampling from the latter conditional distribution can purify the adversarial example and return the corresponding clean sample with a high probability. By using the highest density point in the conditional distribution as the reversed sample, we identify the robust region of a given instance under the diffusion model's reverse process. We show that this robust region is a union of multiple convex sets, and is potentially much larger than the robust regions identified in previous works. In practice, DensePure can approximate the label of the high density region in the conditional distribution so that it can enhance certified robustness. We conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of DensePure by evaluating its certified robustness given a standard model via randomized smoothing. We show that DensePure is consistently better than existing methods on ImageNet, with 7% improvement on average",

    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "Diffusion-based generative models (DBGMs) perturb data to a target noise distribution and reverse this process to generate samples. The choice of noising process, or inference diffusion process, affects both likelihoods and sample quality. For example, extending the inference process with auxiliary variables leads to improved sample quality. While there are many such multivariate diffusions to explore, each new one requires significant model-specific analysis, hindering rapid prototyping and evaluation. In this work, we study Multivariate Diffusion Models (MDMs). For any number of auxiliary variables, we provide a recipe for maximizing a lower-bound on the MDMs likelihood without requiring any model-specific analysis. We then demonstrate how to parameterize the diffusion for a specified target noise distribution; these two points together enable optimizing the inference diffusion process. Optimizing the diffusion expands easy experimentation from just a few well-known processes to an automatic search over all linear diffusions. To demonstrate these ideas, we introduce two new specific diffusions as well as learn a diffusion process on the MNIST, CIFAR10, and ImageNet32 datasets. We show learned MDMs match or surpass bits-per-dims (BPDs) relative to fixed choices of diffusions for a given dataset and model architecture",

    "title": "Contrastive Corpus Attribution for Explaining Representations",
    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "Despite the widespread use of unsupervised models, very few methods are designed to explain them. Most explanation methods explain a scalar model output. However, unsupervised models output representation vectors, the elements of which are not good candidates to explain because they lack semantic meaning. To bridge this gap, recent works defined a scalar explanation output: a dot product-based similarity in the representation space to the sample being explained (i.e., an explicand). Although this enabled explanations of unsupervised models, the interpretation of this approach can still be opaque because similarity to the explicand's representation may not be meaningful to humans. To address this, we propose contrastive corpus similarity, a novel and semantically meaningful scalar explanation output based on a reference corpus and a contrasting foil set of samples. We demonstrate that contrastive corpus similarity is compatible with many post-hoc feature attribution methods to generate COntrastive COrpus Attributions (COCOA) and quantitatively verify that features important to the corpus are identified. We showcase the utility of COCOA in two ways: (i) we draw insights by explaining augmentations of the same image in a contrastive learning setting (SimCLR); and (ii) we perform zero-shot object localization by explaining the similarity of image representations to jointly learned text representations (CLIP)",

Despite the powerful expressiveness of the popular recurrent neural network (RNN) models for point process data, they may not successfully capture sophisticated non-stationary dependencies in the data due to their recurrent structures. Another popular type of deep model for point process data is based on representing the influence kernel (rather than the intensity function) by neural networks. We take the latter approach and develop a new deep non-stationary influence kernel that can model non-stationary spatio-temporal point processes. The main idea is to approximate the influence kernel with a novel and general low-rank decomposition, enabling efficient representation through deep neural networks and computational efficiency and better performance. We also take a new approach to maintain the non-negativity constraint of the conditional intensity by introducing a log-barrier penalty.

It enables applications of machine learning in settings where data is inherently distributed and undisclosable, such as in the medical domain. Joint training is usually achieved by aggregating local models. When local datasets are small, locally trained models can vary greatly from a globally good model. Bad local models can arbitrarily deteriorate the aggregate model quality, causing federating learning to fail in these settings. We propose a novel approach that avoids this problem by interleaving model aggregation and permutation steps. During a permutation step we redistribute local models across clients through the server, while preserving data privacy, to allow each local model to train on a daisy chain of local datasets. This enables successful training in data-sparse domains. Combined with model aggregation, this approach enables effective learning even if the local datasets are extremely small, while retaining the privacy benefits of federated learning",

    "title": "Relative Behavioral Attributes: Filling the Gap between Symbolic Goal Specification and Reward Learning from Human Preferences",
    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "Generating complex behaviors that satisfy the preferences of non-expert users is a crucial requirement for AI agents. Interactive reward learning from trajectory comparisons (a.k.a. RLHF) is one way to allow non-expert users to convey complex objectives by expressing preferences over short clips of agent behaviors. Even though this parametric method can encode complex tacit knowledge present in the underlying tasks, it implicitly assumes that the human is unable to provide richer feedback than binary preference labels, leading to intolerably high feedback complexity and poor user experience. While providing a detailed symbolic closed-form specification of the objectives might be tempting, it is not always feasible even for an expert user. However, in most cases, humans are aware of how the agent should change its behavior along meaningful axes to fulfill their underlying purpose, even if they are not able to fully specify task objectives symbolically. Using this as motivation, we introduce the notion of Relative Behavioral Attributes, which allows the users to tweak the agent behavior through symbolic concepts (e.g., increasing the softness or speed of agents' movement). We propose two practical methods that can learn to model any kind of behavioral attributes from ordered behavior clips. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods on four tasks with nine different behavioral attributes, showing that once the attributes are learned, end users can produce desirable agent behaviors relatively effortlessly, by providing feedback just around ten times. This is over an order of magnitude less than that required by the popular learning-from-human-preferences baselines.

    "abstract": "Active learning has demonstrated data efficiency in many fields. Existing active learning algorithms, especially in the context of batch-mode deep Bayesian active models, rely heavily on the quality of uncertainty estimations of the model, and are often challenging to scale to large batches. In this paper, we propose Batch-BALanCe, a scalable batch-mode active learning algorithm, which combines insights from decision-theoretic active learning, combinatorial information measure, and diversity sampling. At its core, Batch-BALanCe relies on a novel decision-theoretic acquisition function that facilitates differentiation among different equivalence classes. Intuitively, each equivalence class consists of hypotheses (e.g., posterior samples of deep neural networks) with similar predictions, and Batch-BALanCe adaptively adjusts the size of the equivalence classes as learning progresses. To scale up the computation of queries to large batches, we further propose an efficient batch-mode acquisition procedure, which aims to maximize a novel combinatorial information measure defined through the acquisition function. We show that our algorithm can effectively handle realistic multi-class classification tasks, and achieves compelling performance on several benchmark datasets for active learning under both low- and large-batch regimes",

    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "Variational autoencoders (VAEs) are powerful generative modelling methods, however they suffer from blurry generated samples and reconstructions compared to the images they have been trained on. Significant research effort has been spent to increase the generative capabilities by creating more flexible models but often flexibility comes at the cost of higher complexity and computational cost. Several works have focused on altering the reconstruction term of the evidence lower bound (ELBO), however, often at the expense of losing the mathematical link to maximizing the likelihood of the samples under the modeled distribution. Here we propose a new formulation of the reconstruction term for the VAE that specifically penalizes the generation of blurry images while at the same time still maximizing the ELBO under the modeled distribution. We show the potential of the proposed loss on three different data sets, where it outperforms several recently proposed reconstruction losses for VAEs",

    "abstract": "Rich data and powerful machine learning models allow us to design drugs for a specific protein target <em>in silico</em>. Recently, the inclusion of 3D structures during targeted drug design shows superior performance to other target-free models as the atomic interaction in the 3D space is explicitly modeled. However, current 3D target-aware models either rely on the voxelized atom densities or the autoregressive sampling process, which are not equivariant to rotation or easily violate geometric constraints resulting in unrealistic structures. In this work, we develop a 3D equivariant diffusion model to solve the above challenges. To achieve target-aware molecule design, our method learns a joint generative process of both continuous atom coordinates and categorical atom types with a SE(3)-equivariant network. Moreover, we show that our model can serve as an unsupervised feature extractor to estimate the binding affinity under proper parameterization, which provides an effective way for drug screening. To evaluate our model, we propose a comprehensive framework to evaluate the quality of sampled molecules from different dimensions. Empirical studies show our model could generate molecules with more realistic 3D structures and better affinities towards the protein targets, and improve binding affinity ranking and prediction without retraining",

    "abstract": "There is growing interest in understanding how real brains may approximate gradients and how gradients can be used to train neuromorphic chips. However, neither real brains nor neuromorphic chips can perfectly follow the loss gradient, so parameter updates would necessarily use gradient estimators that have some variance and/or bias. Therefore, there is a need to understand better how variance and bias in gradient estimators impact learning dependent on network and task properties. Here, we show that variance and bias can impair learning on the training data, but some degree of variance and bias in a gradient estimator can be beneficial for generalization. We find that the ideal amount of variance and bias in a gradient estimator are dependent on several properties of the network and task: the size and activity sparsity of the network, the norm of the gradient, and the curvature of the loss landscape. As such, whether considering biologically-plausible learning algorithms or algorithms for training neuromorphic chips, researchers can analyze these properties to determine whether their approximation to gradient descent will be effective for learning given their network and task properties",

In this paper, we treat the evaluation of representations as a model selection problem and propose to use the Minimum Description Length (MDL) principle to devise an evaluation metric. Contrary to the established practice of limiting the capacity of the readout model, we design a hybrid discrete and continuous-valued model space for the readout models and employ a switching strategy to combine their predictions. The MDL score takes model complexity, as well as data efficiency into account. As a result, the most appropriate model for the specific task and representation will be chosen, making it a unified measure for comparison. The proposed metric can be efficiently computed with an online method and we present results for pre-trained vision encoders of various architectures (ResNet and ViT) and objective functions (supervised and self-supervised) on a range of downstream tasks. We compare our methods with accuracy-based approaches and show that the latter are inconsistent when multiple readout models are used. Finally, we discuss important properties revealed by our evaluations such as model scaling, preferred readout model, and data efficiency",

However, it requires massive task-specific data, which may not be plausible in many real-world applications. Data augmentation methods such as representation interpolation, token replacement, or augmentation with models are applied to tackle this problem. However, these data augmentation methods either potentially cause shifts in decision boundaries (representation interpolation), are not expressive enough (token replacement), or introduce too much computational overhead (augmentation with models). To this end, we propose AugPro (Augmentation with Projection), an effective and efficient data augmentation method for distillation. Our method builds on top of representation interpolation augmentation methods to maintain the diversity of expressions and converts the augmented data to tokens to avoid shifting decision boundaries. It uses simple operations that come with little computational overhead. The results on multiple GLUE tasks show that our methods can improve distillation performance by a large margin at a low time cost",

    "abstract": "Recent works have shown that language modeling can be effectively used to train reinforcement learning (RL) policies. However, the success of applying existing language models to planning, in which we wish to obtain a trajectory of actions to reach some goal, is less straightforward. The typical autoregressive generation procedures of language models preclude sequential refinement of earlier steps, which limits the effectiveness of a predicted plan. In this paper, we suggest an approach towards integrating planning with language models based on the idea of iterative energy minimization, and illustrate how such a procedure leads to improved RL performance across different tasks. We train a masked language model to capture an implicit energy function over trajectories of actions, and formulate planning as finding a trajectory of actions with minimum energy. We illustrate how this procedure enables improved performance over recent approaches across BabyAI and Atari environments. We further demonstrate unique benefits of our iterative optimization procedure, involving new task generalization, test-time constraints adaptation, and the ability to compose plans together.

    "title": "Verifying the Union of Manifolds Hypothesis for Image Data",
    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "Deep learning has had tremendous success at learning low-dimensional representations of high-dimensional data. This success would be impossible if there was no hidden low-dimensional structure in data of interest; this existence is posited by the manifold hypothesis, which states that the data lies on an unknown manifold of low intrinsic dimension. In this paper, we argue that this hypothesis does not properly capture the low-dimensional structure typically present in image data. Assuming that data lies on a single manifold implies intrinsic dimension is identical across the entire data space, and does not allow for subregions of this space to have a different number of factors of variation. To address this deficiency, we consider the union of manifolds hypothesis, which states that data lies on a disjoint union of manifolds of varying intrinsic dimensions. We empirically verify this hypothesis on commonly-used image datasets, finding that indeed, observed data lies on a disconnected set and that intrinsic dimension is not constant. We also provide insights into the implications of the union of manifolds hypothesis in deep learning, both supervised and unsupervised, showing that designing models with an inductive bias for this structure improves performance across classification and generative modelling tasks.

    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "Humans excel at lifelong learning, as the brain has evolved to be robust to distribution shifts and noise in our ever-changing environment. Deep neural networks (DNNs), however, exhibit catastrophic forgetting and the learned representations drift drastically as they encounter a new task. This alludes to a different error-based learning mechanism in the brain. Unlike DNNs, where learning scales linearly with the magnitude of the error, the sensitivity to errors in the brain decreases as a function of their magnitude. To this end, we propose \"ESMER\" which employs a principled mechanism to modulate error sensitivity in a dual-memory rehearsal-based system. Concretely, it maintains a memory of past errors and uses it to modify the learning dynamics so that the model learns more from small consistent errors compared to large sudden errors. We also propose \"Error-Sensitive Reservoir Sampling\" to maintain episodic memory, which leverages the error history to pre-select low-loss samples as candidates for the buffer, which are better suited for retaining information. Empirical results show that ESMER effectively reduces forgetting and abrupt drift in representations at the task boundary by gradually adapting to the new task while consolidating knowledge. Remarkably, it also enables the model to learn under high levels of label noise, which is ubiquitous in real-world data streams",

Accordingly, inspired by the power of contrastive learning in preventing dimensional collapse, we propose a novel normalization layer ContraNorm. Intuitively, ContraNorm implicitly shatters representations in the embedding space, leading to a more uniform distribution and slighter dimensional collapse. On the theoretical analysis, we prove that ContraNorm can alleviate both complete collapse and dimensional collapse under some conditions. Our proposed normalization layer can be easily inserted into GNNs and Transformers with negligible parameter overhead.

Reinforcement learning approaches for dexterous rigid object manipulation would struggle in this setting due to the complexity of physics interaction with deformable objects. At the same time, previous trajectory optimization approaches with differentiable physics for deformable manipulation would suffer from local optima caused by the explosion of contact modes from hand-object interactions. To address these challenges, we propose DexDeform, a principled framework that abstracts dexterous manipulation skills from human demonstration, and refines the learned skills with differentiable physics. Concretely, we first collect a small set of human demonstrations using teleoperation. And we then train a skill model using demonstrations for planning over action abstractions in imagination. To explore the goal space, we further apply augmentations to the existing deformable shapes in demonstrations and use a gradient optimizer to refine the actions planned by the skill model. Finally, we adopt the refined trajectories as new demonstrations for finetuning the skill model. To evaluate the effectiveness of our approach, we introduce a suite of six challenging dexterous deformable object manipulation tasks.

Prior work predominantly approaches NER as sequence labeling or span classification. We instead frame NER as a representation learning problem that maximizes the similarity between the vector representations of an entity mention and its type. This makes it easy to handle nested and flat NER alike, and can better leverage noisy self-supervision signals. A major challenge to this bi-encoder formulation for NER lies in separating non-entity spans from entity mentions. Instead of explicitly labeling all non-entity spans as the same class $\\texttt{Outside}$ ($\\texttt{O}$) as in most prior methods, we introduce a novel dynamic thresholding loss, learned in conjunction with the standard contrastive loss.

In high-risk applications like healthcare, practitioners require fully calibrated probability predictions for decision-making.

Most existing calibration methods either lack theoretical guarantees for producing calibrated outputs, reduce classification accuracy in the process, or only calibrate the predicted class. This paper proposes a new Kernel-based calibration method called KCal. Unlike existing calibration procedures, KCal does not operate directly on the logits or softmax outputs of the DNN. Instead, KCal learns a metric space on the penultimate-layer latent embedding and generates predictions using kernel density estimates on a calibration set. We first analyze KCal theoretically, showing that it enjoys a provable full calibration guarantee.

We propose a new semi-supervised learning method, Semantic Positives via Pseudo-Labels (SEMPPL), that combines labelled and unlabelled data to learn informative representations. Our method extends self-supervised contrastive learning—where representations are shaped by distinguishing whether two samples represent the same underlying datum (positives) or not (negatives)—with a novel approach to selecting positives. To enrich the set of positives, we leverage the few existing ground-truth labels to predict the missing ones through a k-nearest neighbors classifier by using the learned embeddings of the labelled data. We thus extend the set of positives with datapoints having the same pseudo-label and call these semantic positives. We jointly learn the representation and predict bootstrapped pseudo-labels. This creates a reinforcing cycle. Strong initial representations enable better pseudo-label predictions which then improve the selection of semantic positives and lead to even better representations. SEMPPL outperforms competing semi-supervised methods setting new state-of-the-art performance of 76% and 68.5% top-1accuracy when using a ResNet-50 and training on 10% and 1% of labels on ImageNet, respectively. Furthermore, when using selective kernels, SEMPPL significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art achieving 72.3% and 78.3% top-1accuracy on ImageNet with 1% and 10% labels, respectively, which improves absolute +7.8% and +6.2% over previous work. SEMPPL also exhibits state-of-the-art performance over larger ResNet models as well as strong robustness, out-of-distribution and transfer performance.

    "abstract": "Privacy costs may negate the benefits of using adaptive optimizers in differentially private model training. Prior works typically address this issue by using auxiliary information (e.g., public data) to boost the effectiveness of adaptive optimization. In this work, we explore techniques to estimate and efficiently adapt to gradient geometry in private adaptive optimization without auxiliary data. Motivated by the observation that adaptive methods can tolerate stale preconditioners, we propose differentially private adaptive training with delayed preconditioners (DP^2), a simple method that constructs delayed but less noisy preconditioners to better realize the benefits of adaptivity. Theoretically, we provide convergence guarantees for our method for both convex and non-convex problems, and analyze trade-offs between delay and privacy noise reduction. Empirically, we explore DP^2 across several real-world datasets, demonstrating that it can improve convergence speed by as much as 4× relative to non-adaptive baselines and match the performance of state-of-the-art optimization methods that require auxiliary data",

    "abstract": "We present Phenaki, a model capable of realistic video synthesis given a sequence of textual prompts. Generating videos from text is particularly challenging due to the computational cost, limited quantities of high quality text-video data and variable length of videos. To address these issues, we introduce a new causal model for learning video representation which compresses the video to a small discrete tokens representation. This tokenizer is auto-regressive in time, which allows it to work with video representations of different length. To generate video tokens from text we are using a bidirectional masked transformer conditioned on pre-computed text tokens. The generated video tokens are subsequently de-tokenized to create the actual video. To address data issues, we demonstrate how joint training on a large corpus of image-text pairs as well as a smaller number of video-text examples can result in generalization beyond what is available in the video datasets. Compared to the previous video generation methods, Phenaki can generate arbitrary long videos conditioned on a sequence of prompts (i.e. time variable text or story) in open domain. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time a paper studies generating videos from time variable prompts",

    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "Multiple instance learning (MIL) is a popular weakly-supervised learning model on the whole slide image (WSI) for AI-assisted pathology diagnosis. The recent advance in attention-based MIL allows the model to find its region-of-interest (ROI) for interpretation by learning the attention weights for image patches of WSI slides. However, we empirically find that the interpretability of some related methods is either untrustworthy as the principle of MIL is violated or unsatisfactory as the high-attention regions are not consistent with experts' annotations. In this paper, we propose Bayes-MIL to address the problem from a probabilistic perspective. The induced patch-level uncertainty is proposed as a new measure of MIL interpretability, which outperforms previous methods in matching doctors annotations. We design a slide-dependent patch regularizer (SDPR) for the attention, imposing constraints derived from the MIL assumption, on the attention distribution. SDPR explicitly constrains the model to generate correct attention values. The spatial information is further encoded by an approximate convolutional conditional random field (CRF), for better interpretability. Experimental results show Bayes-MIL outperforms the related methods in patch-level and slide-level metrics and provides much better interpretable ROI on several large-scale WSI datasets",

    "title": "Investigating Multi-task Pretraining and Generalization in Reinforcement Learning",
    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "Deep reinforcement learning~(RL) has achieved remarkable successes in complex single-task settings. However, designing RL agents that can learn multiple tasks and leverage prior experience to quickly adapt to a related new task remains challenging. Despite previous attempts to improve on these areas, our understanding of multi-task training and generalization in RL remains limited. To fill this gap, we investigate the generalization capabilities of a popular actor-critic method, IMPALA. Specifically, we build on previous work that has advocated for the use of modes and difficulties of Atari 2600 games as a challenging benchmark for transfer learning in RL. We do so by pretraining an agent on multiple variants of the same Atari game before fine-tuning on the remaining never-before-seen variants. This protocol simplifies the multi-task pretraining phase by limiting negative interference between tasks and allows us to better understand the dynamics of multi-task training and generalization. We find that, given a fixed amount of pretraining data, agents trained with more variations are able to generalize better. Surprisingly, we also observe that this advantage can still be present after fine-tuning for 200M environment frames than when doing zero-shot transfer. This highlights the potential effect of a good learned representation. We also find that, even though small networks have remained popular to solve Atari 2600 games, increasing the capacity of the value and policy network is critical to achieve good performance as we increase the number of pretraining modes and difficulties. Overall, our findings emphasize key points that are essential for efficient multi-task training and generalization in reinforcement learning",

    "abstract": "Model compression is vital to the deployment of deep learning on edge devices. Low precision representations, achieved via quantization of weights and activations, can reduce inference time and memory requirements. However, quantifying and predicting the response of a model to the changes associated with this procedure remains challenging. This response is non-linear and heterogeneous throughout the network. Understanding which groups of parameters and activations are more sensitive to quantization than others is a critical stage in maximizing efficiency. For this purpose, we propose FIT. Motivated by an information geometric perspective, FIT combines the Fisher information with a model of quantization. We find that FIT can estimate the final performance of a network without retraining. FIT effectively fuses contributions from both parameter and activation quantization into a single metric. Additionally, FIT is fast to compute when compared to existing methods, demonstrating favourable convergence properties. These properties are validated experimentally across hundreds of quantization configurations, with a focus on layer-wise mixed-precision quantization",

However, because manual inspection of a graph is difficult, it is unclear if the studied perturbations always preserve a core assumption of adversarial examples: that of unchanged semantic content. To address this problem, we introduce a more principled notion of an adversarial graph, which is aware of semantic content change. Using Contextual Stochastic Block Models (CSBMs) and real-world graphs, our results suggest: $i)$ for a majority of nodes the prevalent perturbation models include a large fraction of perturbed graphs violating the unchanged semantics assumption; $ii)$ surprisingly, all assessed GNNs show over-robustness - that is robustness beyond the point of semantic change. We find this to be a complementary phenomenon to adversarial examples and show that including the label-structure of the training graph into the inference process of GNNs significantly reduces over-robustness, while having a positive effect on test accuracy and adversarial robustness. Theoretically, leveraging our new semantics-aware notion of robustness, we prove that there is no robustness-accuracy tradeoff for inductively classifying a newly added node",

As a result, often only a small selection of popular, dense models are reused across different contexts and tasks. Increasingly, sparsely activated models, which seek to decouple model size from computation costs, are becoming an attractive alternative to dense models. Although more efficient in terms of quality and computation cost, sparse models remain data-hungry and costly to train from scratch in the large scale regime. In this work, we propose sparse upcycling -- a simple way to reuse sunk training costs by initializing a sparsely activated Mixture-of-Experts model from a dense checkpoint. We show that sparsely upcycled T5 Base, Large, and XL language models and Vision Transformer Base and Large models, respectively, significantly outperform their dense counterparts on SuperGLUE and ImageNet, using only ~50% of the initial dense pretraining sunk cost. The upcycled models also outperform sparse models trained from scratch on 100% of the initial dense pretraining computation budget",

    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "Recent works have shown that large models pretrained on common visual learning tasks can provide useful representations for a wide range of specialized perception problems, as well as a variety of robotic manipulation tasks. While prior work on robotic manipulation has predominantly used frozen pretrained features, we demonstrate that in robotics this approach can fail to reach optimal performance, and that fine-tuning of the full model can lead to significantly better results. Unfortunately, fine-tuning disrupts the pretrained visual representation, and causes representational drift towards the fine-tuned task thus leading to a loss of the versatility of the original model. We introduce a method for lossless adaptation to address this shortcoming of classical fine-tuning. We demonstrate that appropriate placement of our parameter efficient adapters can significantly reduce the performance gap between frozen pretrained representations and full end-to-end fine-tuning without changes to the original representation and thus preserving original capabilities of the pretrained model. We perform a comprehensive investigation across three major model architectures (ViTs, NFNets, and ResNets), supervised (ImageNet-1K classification) and self-supervised pretrained weights (CLIP, BYOL, Visual MAE) in three manipulation task domains and 35 individual tasks, and demonstrate that our claims are strongly validated in various settings.

    "title": "Logical Message Passing Networks with One-hop Inference on Atomic Formulas",
    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "Complex Query Answering (CQA) over Knowledge Graphs (KGs) has attracted a lot of attention to potentially support many applications. Given that KGs are usually incomplete, neural models are proposed to answer the logical queries by parameterizing set operators with complex neural networks. However, such methods usually train neural set operators with a large number of entity and relation embeddings from the zero, where whether and how the embeddings or the neural set operators contribute to the performance remains not clear. In this paper, we propose a simple framework for complex query answering that decomposes the KG embeddings from neural set operators. We propose to represent the complex queries into the query graph. On top of the query graph, we propose the Logical Message Passing Neural Network (LMPNN) that connects the local one-hop inferences on atomic formulas to the global logical reasoning for complex query answering. We leverage existing effective KG embeddings to conduct one-hop inferences on atomic formulas, the results of which are regarded as the messages passed in LMPNN. The reasoning process over the overall logical formulas is turned into the forward pass of LMPNN that incrementally aggregates local information to finally predict the answers' embeddings. The complex logical inference across different types of queries will then be learned from training examples based on the LMPNN architecture. Theoretically, our query-graph represenation is more general than the prevailing operator-tree formulation, so our approach applies to a broader range of complex KG queries. Empirically, our approach yields the new state-of-the-art neural CQA model. Our research bridges the gap between complex KG query answering tasks and the long-standing achievements of knowledge graph representation learning.

    "title": "Noise-Robust De-Duplication at Scale",
    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "Identifying near duplicates within large, noisy text corpora has a myriad of applications that range from de-duplicating training datasets, reducing privacy risk, and evaluating test set leakage, to identifying reproduced news articles and literature within large corpora. Across these diverse applications, the overwhelming majority of work relies on $N$-grams. Limited efforts have been made to evaluate how well $N$-gram methods perform, in part because it is unclear how one could create an unbiased evaluation dataset for a massive corpus. This study uses the unique timeliness of historical news wires to create a 27,210 document dataset, with 122,876 positive duplicate pairs, for studying noise-robust de-duplication. The time-sensitivity of news makes comprehensive hand labelling feasible - despite the massive overall size of the corpus - as duplicates occur within a narrow date range. The study then develops and evaluates a range of de-duplication methods: hashing and $N$-gram overlap (which predominate in the literature), a contrastively trained bi-encoder, and a ``re-rank'' style approach combining a bi- and cross-encoder. The neural approaches significantly outperform hashing and $N$-gram overlap. We show that the bi-encoder scales well, de-duplicating a 10 million article corpus on a single GPU card in a matter of hours. We also apply our pre-trained model to the RealNews and patent portions of C4 (Colossal Clean Crawled Corpus), illustrating that a neural approach can identify many near duplicates missed by hashing, in the presence of various types of noise. The public release of our NEWS-COPY de-duplication dataset, codebase, and the pre-trained models will facilitate further research and applications",

    "abstract": "Current abstractive summarization models either suffer from a lack of clear interpretability or provide incomplete rationales by only highlighting parts of the source document. To this end, we propose the Summarization Program (SP), an interpretable modular framework consisting of an (ordered) list of binary trees, each encoding the step-by-step generative process of an abstractive summary sentence from the source document. A Summarization Program contains one root node per summary sentence, and a distinct tree connects each summary sentence (root node) to the document sentences (leaf nodes) from which it is derived, with the connecting nodes containing intermediate generated sentences. Edges represent different modular operations involved in summarization such as sentence fusion, compression, and paraphrasing. We first propose an efficient best-first search method over neural modules, SP-Search that identifies SPs for human summaries by directly optimizing for ROUGE scores. Next, using these programs as automatic supervision, we propose seq2seq models that generate Summarization Programs, which are then executed to obtain final summaries. We demonstrate that SP-Search effectively represents the generative process behind human summaries using modules that are typically faithful to their intended behavior. We also conduct a simulation study to show that Summarization Programs improve the interpretability of summarization models by allowing humans to better simulate model reasoning. Summarization Programs constitute a promising step toward interpretable and modular abstractive summarization, a complex task previously addressed primarily through blackbox end-to-end neural systems",

Although the programs they generate achieve high token-matching-based scores, they often fail to compile or generate incorrect outputs. The main reason is that conventional Transformer decoding algorithms may not be the best choice for code generation. In this work, we propose a novel Transformer decoding algorithm, Planning-Guided Transformer Decoding (PG-TD), that uses a planning algorithm to do lookahead search and guide the Transformer to generate better programs. Specifically, instead of simply optimizing the likelihood of the generated sequences, the Transformer makes use of a planner that generates candidate programs and tests them on public test cases. The Transformer can therefore make more informed decisions and generate tokens that will eventually lead to higher-quality programs. We also design a mechanism that shares information between the Transformer and the planner to make our algorithm computationally efficient. We empirically evaluate our framework with several large language models as backbones on public coding challenge benchmarks, showing that 1) it can generate programs that consistently achieve higher performance compared with competing baseline methods; 2) it enables controllable code generation, such as concise codes and highly-commented codes by optimizing modified objective",

    "abstract": "Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) is a popular method in sampling. While there are quite a few works of studying this method on various aspects, an interesting question is how to choose its integration time to achieve acceleration. In this work, we consider accelerating the process of sampling from a distribution $\\pi(x) \\propto \\exp(-f(x))$ via HMC via time-varying integration time. When the potential $f$ is $L$-smooth and $m$-strongly convex, i.e. for sampling from a log-smooth and strongly log-concave target distribution $\\pi$, it is known that under a constant integration time, the number of iterations that ideal HMC takes to get an $\\epsilon$ Wasserstein-2 distance to the target $\\pi$ is $O( \\kappa \\log \\frac{1}{\\epsilon} )$, where $\\kappa := \\frac{L}{m}$ is the condition number. We propose a scheme of time-varying integration time based on the roots of Chebyshev polynomials. We show that in the case of quadratic potential $f$, i.e. when the target $\\pi$ is a Gaussian distribution, ideal HMC with this choice of integration time only takes $O( \\sqrt{\\kappa} \\log \\frac{1}{\\epsilon} )$ number of iterations to reach Wasserstein-2 distance less than $\\epsilon$; this improvement on the dependence on condition number is akin to acceleration in optimization. The design and analysis of HMC with the proposed integration time is built on the tools of Chebyshev polynomials. Experiments find the advantage of adopting our scheme of time-varying integration time even for sampling from distributions with smooth strongly convex potentials that are not quadratic",

SP can be interpreted as a method specialized to interpolated models, since it solves the interpolation equations. SP solves these equation by using local linearizations of the model. We take a step further and develop a method for solving the interpolation equations that uses the local second-order approximation of the model. Our resulting method SP2 uses Hessian-vector products to speed-up the convergence of SP. Furthermore, and rather uniquely among second-order methods, the design of SP2 in no way relies on positive definite Hessian matrices or convexity of the objective function. We show SP2 is competitive both in experiments and in theory. We show SP2 is very competitive on matrix completion, non-convex test problems and logistic regression.

To this end, we propose the Hidden Temporal MDP (HiT-MDP) and prove that the option-induced HiT-MDP is homomorphic equivalent to the option-induced SMDP. A novel transformer-based framework is introduced to learn options' embedding vectors (rather than conventional option tuples) on HiT-MDPs. We then derive a stable and sample efficient option discovering method under the maximum-entropy policy gradient framework. Extensive experiments on challenging Mujoco environments demonstrate HiT-MDP's efficiency and effectiveness: under widely used configurations, HiT-MDP achieves competitive, if not better, performance compared to the state-of-the-art baselines on all finite horizon and transfer learning environments. Moreover, HiT-MDP significantly outperforms all baselines on infinite horizon environments while exhibiting smaller variance, faster convergence, and better interpretability.

    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "Fast and accurate adaptation of automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems using only text data in the target domain is a problem of long-standing practical relevance. Text-only adaptation was easy in traditional cascaded ASR systems with completely decoupled acoustic and language models. Recently, the RNNTransducer (RNN-T) has emerged as a default ASR model because of its high accuracy, low latency, and capability of supporting streaming input. However text-only adaptation of the RNN-T model is significantly more challenging due to its tight integration of acoustic and language models and end-to-end training. Existing recent approaches for text-only adaptation of RNN-Ts, either entail significant modification to the network or introduce high latency during decoding. We propose a new approach (TOLSTOI) that imputes speech representations internal to a baseline RNN-T, starting from text-only inputs, and performs in-situ adaptation that results in higher adaptation accuracy without any runtime overheads during decoding. Our imputation model is a function of the labeled data and trained parameters of the ASR model, and that we show, is more effective in controlling catastrophic forgetting compared to existing methods. We establish the effectiveness of TOLSTOI using three target domains and two ASR models of varying complexity. We yield up to 35% relative reduction in word error rate with text-only adaptation while forgetting the least compared to existing adaptation approaches. Our method is easy to implement and can be harnessed on existing RNN-T models without requiring ASR model training from scratch",

    "abstract": "Deep neural networks trained end-to-end to map a measurement of a (noisy) image to a clean image perform excellent for a variety of linear inverse problems. Current methods are only trained on a few hundreds or thousands of images as opposed to the millions of examples deep networks are trained on in other domains. In this work, we study whether major performance gains are expected from scaling up the training set size. We consider image denoising, accelerated magnetic resonance imaging, and super-resolution and empirically determine the reconstruction quality as a function of training set size, while simultaneously scaling the network size. For all three tasks we find that an initially steep power-law scaling slows significantly already at moderate training set sizes. Interpolating those scaling laws suggests that even training on millions of images would not significantly improve performance. To understand the expected behavior, we analytically characterize the performance of a linear estimator learned with early stopped gradient descent. The result formalizes the intuition that once the error induced by learning the signal model is small relative to the error floor, more training examples do not improve performance",

    "title": "Amortised Invariance Learning for Contrastive Self-Supervision",
    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "Contrastive self-supervised learning methods famously produce high quality transferable representations by learning invariances to different data augmentations. Invariances established during pre-training can be interpreted as strong inductive biases. However these may or may not be helpful, depending on if they match the invariance requirements of downstream tasks or not. This has led to several attempts to learn task-specific invariances during pre-training, however, these methods are highly compute intensive and tedious to train. We introduce the notion of amortized invariance learning for contrastive self supervision. In the pre-training stage, we parameterize the feature extractor by differentiable invariance hyper-parameters that control the invariances encoded by the representation. Then, for any downstream task, both linear readout and task-specific invariance requirements can be efficiently and effectively learned by gradient-descent. We evaluate the notion of amortized invariances for contrastive learning over two different modalities: vision and audio, on two widely-used contrastive learning methods in vision: SimCLR and MoCo-v2 with popular architectures like ResNets and Vision Transformers, and SimCLR with ResNet-18 for audio. We show that our amortized features provide a reliable way to learn diverse downstream tasks with different invariance requirements, while using a single feature and avoiding task-specific pre-training. This provides an exciting perspective that opens up new horizons in the field of general purpose representation learning",

We show that this results in optimizing a different objective at the population level, where agents maximize (1) their respective \"internal\" communication accuracy and (2) some measure of alignment between agents. In experiments, we find that this leads to the emergence of languages that are significantly more compositional. Moreover, when agents are trained in populations that are not fully connected (ie. not all agent pairs interact at training time), this approach reduces multi-linguality and improves zero-shot communication with new agents (ie. agents are able to communicate successfully with other agents outside their training partners)",

    "title": "Sequential Gradient Coding For Straggler Mitigation",
    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "In distributed computing, slower nodes (stragglers) usually become a bottleneck. Gradient Coding (GC), introduced by Tandon et al., is an efficient technique that uses principles of error-correcting codes to distribute gradient computation in the presence of stragglers. In this paper, we consider the distributed computation of a sequence of gradients $\\{g(1),g(2),\\ldots,g(J)\\}$, where processing of each gradient $g(t)$ starts in round-$t$ and finishes by round-$(t+T)$. Here $T\\geq 0$ denotes a delay parameter. For the GC scheme, coding is only across computing nodes and this results in a solution where $T=0$. On the other hand, having $T>0$ allows for designing schemes which exploit the temporal dimension as well. In this work, we propose two schemes that demonstrate improved performance compared to GC. Our first scheme combines GC with selective repetition of previously unfinished tasks and achieves improved straggler mitigation. In our second scheme, which constitutes our main contribution, we apply GC to a subset of the tasks and repetition for the remainder of the tasks. We then multiplex these two classes of tasks across workers and rounds in an adaptive manner, based on past straggler patterns. Using theoretical analysis, we demonstrate that our second scheme achieves significant reduction in the computational load. In our experiments, we study a practical setting of concurrently training multiple neural networks over an AWS Lambda cluster involving 256 worker nodes, where our framework naturally applies. We demonstrate that the latter scheme can yield a 16\\% improvement in runtime over the baseline GC scheme, in the presence of naturally occurring, non-simulated stragglers",

    "abstract": "This paper proposes a novel batch normalization strategy for test-time adaptation. Recent test-time adaptation methods heavily rely on the modified batch normalization, i.e., transductive batch normalization (TBN), which calculates the mean and the variance from the current test batch rather than using the running mean and variance obtained from the source data, i.e., conventional batch normalization (CBN). Adopting TBN that employs test batch statistics mitigates the performance degradation caused by the domain shift. However, re-estimating normalization statistics using test data depends on impractical assumptions that a test batch should be large enough and be drawn from i.i.d. stream, and we observed that the previous methods with TBN show critical performance drop without the assumptions. In this paper, we identify that CBN and TBN are in a trade-off relationship and present a new test-time normalization (TTN) method that interpolates the statistics by adjusting the importance between CBN and TBN according to the domain-shift sensitivity of each BN layer. Our proposed TTN improves model robustness to shifted domains across a wide range of batch sizes and in various realistic evaluation scenarios. TTN is widely applicable to other test-time adaptation methods that rely on updating model parameters via backpropagation. We demonstrate that adopting TTN further improves their performance and achieves state-of-the-art performance in various standard benchmarks",

    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "A grand goal in deep learning research is to learn representations capable of generalizing across distribution shifts. Disentanglement is one promising direction aimed at aligning a model's representation with the underlying factors generating the data (e.g. color or background). Existing disentanglement methods, however, rely on an often unrealistic assumption: that factors are statistically independent. In reality, factors (like object color and shape) are correlated. To address this limitation, we consider the use of a relaxed disentanglement criterion -- the Hausdorff Factorized Support (HFS) criterion -- that encourages only pairwise factorized support, rather than a factorial distribution, by minimizing a Hausdorff distance. This allows for arbitrary distributions of the factors over their support, including correlations between them. We show that the use of HFS consistently facilitates disentanglement and recovery of ground-truth factors across a variety of correlation settings and benchmarks, even under severe training correlations and correlation shifts, with in parts over +60% in relative improvement over existing disentanglement methods. In addition, we find that leveraging HFS for representation learning can even facilitate transfer to downstream tasks such as classification under distribution shifts. We hope our original approach and positive empirical results inspire further progress on the open problem of robust generalization.

We present Self-Correction, an approach that decouples an imperfect base generator (an off-the-shelf language model or supervised sequence-to-sequence model) from a separate corrector that learns to iteratively correct imperfect generations. To train the corrector, we propose an online training procedure that can use either scalar or natural language feedback on intermediate imperfect generations. We show that Self-Correction improves upon the base generator in three diverse generation tasks - mathematical program synthesis, lexically-constrained generation, and toxicity control - even when the corrector is much smaller than the base generator",

To this end, we consider two mathematically tractable recurrent neural networks that statistically whiten their inputs --- one with direct recurrent connections and the other with interneurons that mediate recurrent communication. By analyzing the corresponding continuous synaptic dynamics and numerically simulating the networks, we show that the network with interneurons is more robust to initialization than the network with direct recurrent connections in the sense that the convergence time for the synaptic dynamics in the network with interneurons (resp. direct recurrent connections) scales logarithmically (resp. linearly) with the spectrum of their initialization. Our results suggest that interneurons are computationally useful for rapid adaptation to changing input statistics. Interestingly, the network with interneurons is an overparameterized solution of the whitening objective for the network with direct recurrent connections, so our results can be viewed as a recurrent neural network analogue of the implicit acceleration phenomenon observed in overparameterized feedforward linear networks",

    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "Security vulnerabilities in computer systems raise serious concerns as computers process an unprecedented amount of private and sensitive data today. Cache timing attacks (CTA) pose an important practical threat as they can effectively breach many protection mechanisms in today's systems. However, the current detection techniques for cache timing attacks heavily rely on heuristics and expert knowledge, which can lead to brittleness and the inability to adapt to new attacks. To mitigate the CTA threat, we propose MACTA, a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) approach that leverages population-based training to train both attackers and detectors. Following best practices, we develop a realistic simulated MARL environment, MA-AUTOCAT, which enables training and evaluation of cache-timing attackers and detectors. Our empirical results suggest that MACTA is an effective solution without any manual input from security experts. MACTA detectors can generalize to a heuristic attack not exposed in training with a 97.8% detection rate and reduce the attack bandwidth of adaptive attackers by 20% on average. In the meantime, MACTA attackers are qualitatively more effective than other attacks studied, and the average evasion rate of MACTA attackers against an unseen state-of-the-art detector can reach up to 99%. Furthermore, we found that agents equipped with a Transformer encoder can learn effective policies in situations when agents with multi-layer perceptron encoders do not in this environment, suggesting the potential of Transformer structures in CTA problems",

    "abstract": "In this paper we study online Reinforcement Learning (RL) in partially observable dynamical systems. We focus on the Predictive State Representations (PSRs) model, which is an expressive model that captures other well-known models such as Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDP). PSR represents the states using a set of predictions of future observations and is defined entirely using observable quantities. We develop a novel model-based algorithm for PSRs that can learn a near optimal policy in sample complexity scaling polynomially with respect to all the relevant parameters of the systems. Our algorithm naturally works with function approximation to extend to systems with potentially large state and observation spaces. We show that given a realizable model class, the sample complexity of learning the near optimal policy only scales polynomially with respect to the statistical complexity of the model class, without any explicit polynomial dependence on the size of the state and observation spaces. Notably, our work is the first work that shows polynomial sample complexities to compete with the globally optimal policy in PSRs. Finally, we demonstrate how our general theorem can be directly used to derive sample complexity bounds for special models including $m$-step weakly revealing and $m$-step decodable tabular POMDPs, POMDPs with low-rank latent transition, and POMDPs with linear emission and latent transition",

    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "We study decentralized policy learning in Markov games where we control a single agent to play with nonstationary and possibly adversarial opponents. Our goal is to develop a no-regret online learning algorithm that (i) takes actions based on the local information observed by the agent and (ii) is able to find the best policy in hindsight. For such a problem, the nonstationary state transitions due to the varying opponent pose a significant challenge. In light of a recent hardness result (Liu et al., 2022), we focus on the setting where the opponent's previous policies are revealed to the agent for decision making. With such an information structure, we propose a new algorithm, Decentralized Optimistic hypeRpolicy mIrror deScent (DORIS), which achieves $\\sqrt{K}$-regret in the context of general function approximation, where $K$ is the number of episodes. Moreover, when all the agents adopt DORIS, we prove that their mixture policy constitutes an approximate coarse correlated equilibrium. In particular, DORIS maintains a hyperpolicy which is a distribution over the policy space. The hyperpolicy is updated via mirror descent, where the update direction is obtained by an optimistic variant of least-squares policy evaluation. Furthermore, to illustrate the power of our method, we apply DORIS to constrained and vector-valued MDPs, which can be formulated as zero-sum Markov games with a fictitious opponent",

    "abstract": "Conditional neural processes (CNPs; Garnelo et al., 2018a) are attractive meta-learning models which produce well-calibrated predictions and are trainable via a simple maximum likelihood procedure. Although CNPs have many advantages, they are unable to model dependencies in their predictions. Various works propose solutions to this, but these come at the cost of either requiring approximate inference or being limited to Gaussian predictions. In this work, we instead propose to change how CNPs are deployed at test time, without any modifications to the model or training procedure. Instead of making predictions independently for every target point, we autoregressively define a joint predictive distribution using the chain rule of probability, taking inspiration from the neural autoregressive density estimator (NADE) literature. We show that this simple procedure allows factorised Gaussian CNPs to model highly dependent, non-Gaussian predictive distributions. Perhaps surprisingly, in an extensive range of tasks with synthetic and real data, we show that CNPs in autoregressive (AR) mode not only significantly outperform non-AR CNPs, but are also competitive with more sophisticated models that are significantly more computationally expensive and challenging to train. This performance is remarkable given that AR CNPs are not trained to model joint dependencies. Our work provides an example of how ideas from neural distribution estimation can benefit neural processes, and motivates research into the AR deployment of other neural process models",

Besides, existing works have shown that ICL also suffers from various biases and requires delicate calibration treatment. To address both challenges, we advocate a simple and effective solution, $k$NN Prompting, which first queries LLM with training data for distributed representations, then predicts test instances by simply referring to nearest neighbors. We conduct comprehensive experiments to demonstrate its two-fold superiority: 1) Calibration-Free: $k$NN Prompting does not directly align LLM output distribution with task-specific label space, instead leverages such distribution to align test and training instances. It significantly outperforms state-of-the-art calibration-based methods under comparable few-shot scenario. 2) Beyond-Context: $k$NN Prompting can further scale up effectively with as many training data as are available, continually bringing substantial improvements. The scaling trend holds across 10 orders of magnitude ranging from 2 shots to 1024 shots as well as different LLMs scales ranging from 0.8B to 30B. It successfully bridges data scaling into model scaling, and brings new potentials for the gradient-free paradigm of LLM deployment.

However, many datasets are imbalanced in certain label classes (e.g. \"healthy\") and sensitive subgroups (e.g. \"older patients\"). Empirically, this imbalance leads to a lack of generalizability not only of classification but also of fairness properties, especially in over-parameterized models.

This issue is especially problematic for image-based RL, where a change in just one variable, such as the background colour, can change many pixels in the image. The changed pixels can lead to drastic changes in the agent's latent representation of the image, causing the learned policy to fail. To learn more robust representations, we introduce TEmporal Disentanglement (TED), a self-supervised auxiliary task that leads to disentangled image representations exploiting the sequential nature of RL observations. We find empirically that RL algorithms utilising TED as an auxiliary task adapt more quickly to changes in environment variables with continued training compared to state-of-the-art representation learning methods. Since TED enforces a disentangled structure of the representation, our experiments also show that policies trained with TED generalise better to unseen values of variables irrelevant to the task (e.g. background colour) as well as unseen values of variables that affect the optimal policy (e.g. goal positions)",

We explore whether further improvements along the two axes are possible and provide affirmative answers leveraging two instantiations of \\emph{group-wise clipping}. To reduce the compute time overhead of private learning, we show that \\emph{per-layer clipping}, where the gradient of each neural network layer is clipped separately, allows clipping to be performed in conjunction with backpropagation in differentially private optimization. This results in private learning that is as memory-efficient and almost as fast per training update as non-private learning for many workflows of interest. While per-layer clipping with constant thresholds tends to underperform standard flat clipping, per-layer clipping with adaptive thresholds matches or outperforms flat clipping under given training epoch constraints, hence attaining similar or better task performance within less wall time. To explore the limits of scaling (pretrained) models in differentially private deep learning, we privately fine-tune the 175 billion-parameter GPT-3. We bypass scaling challenges associated with clipping gradients that are distributed across multiple devices with \\emph{per-device clipping} that clips the gradient of each model piece separately on its host device.

In contrast, modern overparameterized models can yield small test error despite interpolating noise — a phenomenon often called \"benign overfitting\" or \"harmless interpolation\".

Our main theoretical result establishes tight non-asymptotic bounds for high-dimensional kernel regression that reflect this phenomenon for convolutional kernels, where the filter size regulates the strength of the inductive bias.

    "abstract": "Recently, a variety of methods under the name of non-contrastive learning (like BYOL, SimSiam, SwAV, DINO) show that when equipped with some asymmetric architectural designs, aligning positive pairs alone is sufficient to attain good performance in self-supervised visual learning. Despite some understandings of some specific modules (like the predictor in BYOL), there is yet no unified theoretical understanding of how these seemingly different asymmetric designs can all avoid feature collapse, particularly considering methods that also work without the predictor (like DINO). In this work, we propose a unified theoretical understanding for existing variants of non-contrastive learning. Our theory named Rank Differential Mechanism (RDM) shows that all these asymmetric designs create a consistent rank difference in their dual-branch output features. This rank difference will provably lead to an improvement of effective dimensionality and alleviate either complete or dimensional feature collapse. Different from previous theories, our RDM theory is applicable to different asymmetric designs (with and without the predictor), and thus can serve as a unified understanding of existing non-contrastive learning methods. Besides, our RDM theory also provides practical guidelines for designing many new non-contrastive variants. We show that these variants indeed achieve comparable performance to existing methods on benchmark datasets, and some of them even outperform the baselines.

Meanwhile, the trajectories are used to conduct self-imitation learning with a moral-enhanced objective. In order to achieve the trade-off between morality and task progress, the agent uses the combination of task policy and moral policy for action selection.

Standard RL methods often perform poorly in this regime due to the function approximation errors on out-of-distribution actions. While a variety of regularization methods have been proposed to mitigate this issue, they are often constrained by policy classes with limited expressiveness that can lead to highly suboptimal solutions. In this paper, we propose representing the policy as a diffusion model, a recent class of highly-expressive deep generative models. We introduce Diffusion Q-learning (Diffusion-QL) that utilizes a conditional diffusion model to represent the policy. In our approach, we learn an action-value function and we add a term maximizing action-values into the training loss of the conditional diffusion model, which results in a loss that seeks optimal actions that are near the behavior policy. We show the expressiveness of the diffusion model-based policy, and the coupling of the behavior cloning and policy improvement under the diffusion model both contribute to the outstanding performance of Diffusion-QL. We illustrate the superiority of our method compared to prior works in a simple 2D bandit example with a multimodal behavior policy.

Most existing CM2AB works focused on maximizing the group performance of all agents---the accumulation of all agents' individual performance (i.e., individual reward). However, in many applications, the performance of the system is more sensitive to the ``bad'' agent---the agent with the worst individual performance. For example, in a drone swarm, a ``bad'' agent may crash into other drones and severely degrade the system performance. In that case, the key of the learning algorithm design is to coordinate computational and communicational resources among agents so to optimize the individual learning performance of the ``bad'' agent. In CM2AB, maximizing the group performance is equivalent to minimizing the group regret of all agents, and minimizing the individual performance can be measured by minimizing the maximum (worst) individual regret among agents. Minimizing the maximum individual regret was largely ignored in prior literature, and currently, there is little work on how to minimize this objective with a low communication overhead. In this paper, we propose a near-optimal algorithm on both individual and group regrets, in addition, we also propose a novel communication module in the algorithm, which only needs \\(O(\\log (\\log T))\\) communication times where \\(T\\) is the number of decision rounds.

As there is no clear boundary of tasks, it is not obvious when and what information in the past to be preserved as a better remedy for the stability-plasticity dilemma. To this end, we propose a scheduled transfer of previously learned knowledge. We further propose a data-driven balancing between the knowledge in the past and the present in learning objective. Moreover, since it is not straight-forward to use the previously proposed forgetting measure without task boundaries, we further propose a novel forgetting measure based on information theory that can capture forgetting.

    "abstract": "Recently, large-scale text retrieval has made impressive progress, facilitating both information retrieval and downstream knowledge-intensive tasks (e.g., open-domain QA and dialogue). With a moderate amount of data, a neural text retriever can outperform traditional methods such as BM25 by a large step. However, while being applied to out-of-domain data, the performance of a neural retriever degrades considerably. Therefore, how to enable a retriever to perform more robustly across different domains or tasks and even show strong zero-shot transfer ability is critical for building scalable IR systems. To this end, we propose HypeR, a hyper-prompted training mechanism to enable uniform retrieval across tasks of different domains. Specifically, our approach jointly trains the query encoder with a shared prompt-based parameter pool and a prompt synthesizer that dynamically composes hyper-prompt for encoding each query from different tasks or domains. Besides, to avoid the mode collapse of prompt attention distribution for different queries, we design a contrastive prompt regularization that promotes the mode of prompt attention to be aligned and uniform. Through multi-task hyper-prompted training, our retriever can master the ability to dynamically represent different types of queries and transfer knowledge across different domains and tasks. Extensive experiments show our model attains better retrieval performance across different tasks and better zero-shot transfer ability compared with various previous methods",

    "title": "EPISODE: Episodic Gradient Clipping with Periodic Resampled Corrections for Federated Learning with Heterogeneous Data",
    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "Gradient clipping is an important technique for deep neural networks with exploding gradients, such as recurrent neural networks. Recent studies have shown that the loss functions of these networks do not satisfy the conventional smoothness condition, but instead satisfy a relaxed smoothness condition, i.e., the Lipschitz constant of the gradient scales linearly in terms of the gradient norm. Due to this observation, several gradient clipping algorithms have been developed for nonconvex and relaxed-smooth functions. However, the existing algorithms only apply to the single-machine or multiple-machine setting with homogeneous data across machines. It remains unclear how to design provably efficient gradient clipping algorithms in the general Federated Learning (FL) setting with heterogeneous data and limited communication rounds. In this paper, we design EPISODE, the very first algorithm to solve FL problems with heterogeneous data in the nonconvex and relaxed smoothness setting. The key ingredients of the algorithm are two new techniques called \\textit{episodic gradient clipping} and \\textit{periodic resampled corrections}. At the beginning of each round, EPISODE resamples stochastic gradients from each client and obtains the global averaged gradient, which is used to (1) determine whether to apply gradient clipping for the entire round and (2) construct local gradient corrections for each client. Notably, our algorithm and analysis provide a unified framework for both homogeneous and heterogeneous data under any noise level of the stochastic gradient, and it achieves state-of-the-art complexity results. In particular, we prove that EPISODE can achieve linear speedup in the number of machines, and it requires significantly fewer communication rounds. Experiments on several heterogeneous datasets, including text classification and image classification, show the superior performance of EPISODE over several strong baselines in FL.

    "title": "On the Trade-Off between Actionable Explanations and the Right to be Forgotten",
    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "As machine learning (ML) models are increasingly being deployed in high-stakes applications, policymakers have suggested tighter data protection regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA). One key principle is the \"right to be forgotten\" which gives users the right to have their data deleted. Another key principle is the right to an actionable explanation, also known as algorithmic recourse, allowing users to reverse unfavorable decisions. To date, it is unknown whether these two principles can be operationalized simultaneously. Therefore, we introduce and study the problem of recourse invalidation in the context of data deletion requests. More specifically, we theoretically and empirically analyze the behavior of popular state-of-the-art algorithms and demonstrate that the recourses generated by these algorithms are likely to be invalidated if a small number of data deletion requests (e.g., 1 or 2) warrant updates of the predictive model. For the setting of differentiable models, we suggest a framework to identify a minimal subset of critical training points which, when removed, maximize the fraction of invalidated recourses.Using our framework, we empirically show that the removal of as little as 2 data instances from the training set can invalidate up to 95 percent of all recourses output by popular state-of-the-art algorithms. Thus, our work raises fundamental questions about the compatibility of ``the right to an actionable explanation'' in the context of the ``right to be forgotten'', while also providing constructive insights on the determining factors of recourse robustness",

    "title": "Computing all Optimal Partial Transports",
    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "We consider the classical version of the optimal partial transport problem. Let $\\mu$ (with a mass of $U$) and $\\nu$ (with a mass of $S$) be two discrete mass distributions with $S \\le U$ and let $n$ be the total number of points in the supports of $\\mu$ and $\\nu$. For a parameter $\\alpha \\in [0,S]$, consider the minimum-cost transport plan $\\sigma_\\alpha$ that transports a mass of $\\alpha$ from $\\nu$ to $\\mu$. An \\emph{OT-profile} captures the behavior of the cost of $\\sigma_\\alpha$ as $\\alpha$ varies from $0$ to $S$. There is only limited work on OT-profile and its mathematical properties (see~\\cite{figalli2010optimal}). In this paper, we present a novel framework to analyze the properties of the OT-profile and also present an algorithm to compute it. When $\\mu$ and $\\nu$ are discrete mass distributions, we show that the OT-profile is a piecewise-linear non-decreasing convex function. Let $K$ be the combinatorial complexity of this function, i.e., the number of line segments required to represent the OT-profile. Our exact algorithm computes the OT-profile in $\\tilde{O}(n^2K)$ time. Given $\\delta > 0$, we also show that the algorithm by ~\\cite{lahn2019graph} can be used to $\\delta$-approximate the OT-profile in $O(n^2/\\delta + n/\\delta^2)$ time. This approximation is a piecewise-linear function of a combinatorial complexity of $O(1/\\delta)$. An OT-profile is arguably more valuable than the OT-cost itself and can be used within applications. Under a reasonable assumption of outliers, we also show that the first derivative of the OT-profile sees a noticeable rise before any of the mass from outliers is transported. By using this property, we get an improved prediction accuracy for an outlier detection experiment. We also use this property to predict labels and estimate the class priors within PU-Learning experiments. Both these experiments are conducted on real datasets",

    "abstract": "We present a novel neural network architecture using self-attention, the Wavefunction Transformer (PsiFormer), which can be used as an approximation (or \"Ansatz\") for solving the many-electron Schrödinger equation, the fundamental equation for quantum chemistry and material science. This equation can be solved *from first principles*, requiring no external training data. In recent years, deep neural networks like the FermiNet and PauliNet have been used to significantly improve the accuracy of these first-principle calculations, but they lack an attention-like mechanism for gating interactions between electrons. Here we show that the PsiFormer can be used as a drop-in replacement for these other neural networks, often dramatically improving the accuracy of the calculations. On larger molecules especially, the ground state energy can be improved by dozens of kcal/mol, a qualitative leap over previous methods. This demonstrates that self-attention networks can learn complex quantum mechanical correlations between electrons, and are a promising route to reaching unprecedented accuracy in chemical calculations on larger systems",

    "title": "Probabilistically Robust Recourse: Navigating the Trade-offs between Costs and Robustness in Algorithmic Recourse",
    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "As machine learning models are increasingly being employed to make consequential decisions in real-world settings, it becomes critical to ensure that individuals who are adversely impacted (e.g., loan denied) by the predictions of these models are provided with a means for recourse. While several approaches have been proposed to construct recourses for affected individuals, the recourses output by these methods either achieve low costs (i.e., ease-of-implementation) or robustness to small perturbations (i.e., noisy implementations of recourses), but not both due to the inherent trade-offs between the recourse costs and robustness. Furthermore, prior approaches do not provide end users with any agency over navigating the aforementioned trade-offs. In this work, we address the above challenges by proposing the first algorithmic framework which enables users to effectively manage the recourse cost vs. robustness trade-offs. More specifically, our framework Probabilistically ROBust rEcourse (PROBE) lets users choose the probability with which a recourse could get invalidated (recourse invalidation rate) if small changes are made to the recourse i.e., the recourse is implemented somewhat noisily. To this end, we propose a novel objective function which simultaneously minimizes the gap between the achieved (resulting) and desired recourse invalidation rates, minimizes recourse costs, and also ensures that the resulting recourse achieves a positive model prediction. We develop novel theoretical results to characterize the recourse invalidation rates corresponding to any given instance w.r.t. different classes of underlying models (e.g., linear models, tree based models etc.), and leverage these results to efficiently optimize the proposed objective. Experimental evaluation with multiple real world datasets demonstrates the efficacy of the proposed framework",

    "title": "The Curious Case of Benign Memorization",
    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "Despite the empirical advances of deep learning across a variety of learning tasks, our theoretical understanding of its success is still very restricted. One of the key challenges is the overparametrized nature of modern models, enabling complete overfitting of the data even if the labels are randomized, i.e. networks can completely \\textit{memorize} all given patterns. While such a memorization capacity seems worrisome, in this work we show that under training protocols that include \\textit{data augmentation}, neural networks learn to memorize entirely random labels in a benign way, i.e. they learn embeddings that lead to highly non-trivial performance under nearest neighbour probing. We demonstrate that deep models have the surprising ability to separate noise from signal by distributing the task of memorization and feature learning to different layers. As a result, only the very last layers are used for memorization, while preceding layers encode performant features which remain largely unaffected by the label noise. We explore the intricate role of the augmentations used for training and identify a memorization-generalization trade-off in terms of their diversity, marking a clear distinction to all previous works. Finally, we give a first explanation for the emergence of benign memorization by showing that \\textit{malign} memorization under data augmentation is infeasible due to the insufficient capacity of the model for the increased sample size. As a consequence, the network is forced to leverage the correlated nature of the augmentations and as a result learns meaningful features.

    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "Many datasets are biased, namely they contain easy-to-learn features that are highly correlated with the target class only in the dataset but not in the true underlying distribution of the data. For this reason, learning unbiased models from biased data has become a very relevant research topic in the last years. In this work, we tackle the problem of learning representations that are robust to biases. We first present a margin-based theoretical framework that allows us to clarify why recent contrastive losses (InfoNCE, SupCon, etc.) can fail when dealing with biased data. Based on that, we derive a novel formulation of the supervised contrastive loss ($\\epsilon$-SupInfoNCE), providing more accurate control of the minimal distance between positive and negative samples. Furthermore, thanks to our theoretical framework, we also propose FairKL, a new debiasing regularization loss, that works well even with extremely biased data. We validate the proposed losses on standard vision datasets including CIFAR10, CIFAR100, and ImageNet, and we assess the debiasing capability of FairKL with $\\epsilon$-SupInfoNCE, reaching state-of-the-art performance on a number of biased datasets, including real instances of biases \"in the wild\"",

In this paper, we propose compositional prompt tuning with motion cues: an extended prompt tuning paradigm for compositional predictions of video data. In particular, we present Relation Prompt (RePro) for Open-vocabulary Video Visual Relation Detection (Open-VidVRD), where conventional prompt tuning is easily biased to certain subject-object combinations and motion patterns. To this end, RePro addresses the two technical challenges of Open-VidVRD: 1) the prompt tokens should respect the two different semantic roles of subject and object, and 2) the tuning should account for the diverse spatiotemporal motion patterns of the subject-object compositions. Our RePro achieves a new state-of-the-art performance on two VidVRD benchmarks of not only the base training object and predicate categories, but also the unseen ones. Extensive ablations also demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed compositional and multi-mode design of prompt. Code is available at https://github.com/Dawn-LX/OpenVoc-VidVRD",

    "title": "Multi-objective optimization via equivariant deep hypervolume approximation",
    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "Optimizing multiple competing objectives is a common problem across science and industry. The inherent inextricable trade-off between those objectives leads one to the task of exploring their Pareto front. A meaningful quantity for the purpose of the latter is the hypervolume indicator, which is used in Bayesian Optimization (BO) and Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs). However, the computational complexity for the calculation of the hypervolume scales unfavorably with increasing number of objectives and data points, which restricts its use in those common multi-objective optimization frameworks. To overcome these restrictions, previous work has focused on approximating the hypervolume using deep learning. In this work, we propose a novel deep learning architecture to approximate the hypervolume function, which we call DeepHV. For better sample efficiency and generalization, we exploit the fact that the hypervolume is scale equivariant in each of the objectives as well as permutation invariant w.r.t. both the objectives and the samples, by using a deep neural network that is equivariant w.r.t. the combined group of scalings and permutations. We show through an ablation study that including these symmetries leads to significantly improved model accuracy. We evaluate our method against exact, and approximate hypervolume methods in terms of accuracy, computation time, and generalization. We also apply and compare our methods to state-of-the-art multi-objective BO methods and EAs on a range of synthetic and real-world benchmark test cases. The results show that our methods are promising for such multi-objective optimization tasks",

DiffusER is not only a strong generative model in general, rivalling autoregressive models on several tasks spanning machine translation, summarization, and style transfer; it can also perform other varieties of generation that standard autoregressive models are not well-suited for.

To avoid excessive computation, extracting and training only on the most informative subset is drawing increasing attention. Nevertheless, it is still an open question how to select such a subset on which the model trained generalizes on par with the full data. In this paper, we propose dynamic margin selection (DynaMS). DynaMS leverages the distance from candidate samples to the classification boundary to construct the subset, and the subset is dynamically updated during model training. We show that DynaMS converges with large probability, and for the first time show both in theory and practice that dynamically updating the subset can result in better generalization over previous works. To reduce the additional computation incurred by the selection, a light parameter sharing proxy (PSP) is designed. PSP is able to faithfully evaluate instances with respect to the current model, which is necessary for dynamic selection. Extensive analysis and experiments demonstrate the superiority of the proposed approach in data selection against many state-of-the-art counterparts on benchmark datasets",

    "abstract": "Despite their success with unstructured data, deep neural networks are not yet a panacea for structured tabular data. In the tabular domain, their efficiency crucially relies on various forms of regularization to prevent overfitting and provide strong generalization performance. Existing regularization techniques include broad modelling decisions such as choice of architecture, loss functions, and optimization methods. In this work, we introduce Tabular Neural Gradient Orthogonalization and Specialization (TANGOS), a novel framework for regularization in the tabular setting built on latent unit attributions. The gradient attribution of an activation with respect to a given input feature suggests how the neuron attends to that feature, and is often employed to interpret the predictions of deep networks. In TANGOS, we take a different approach and incorporate neuron attributions directly into training to encourage orthogonalization and specialization of latent attributions in a fully-connected network. Our regularizer encourages neurons to focus on sparse, non-overlapping input features and results in a set of diverse and specialized latent units. In the tabular domain, we demonstrate that our approach can lead to improved out-of-sample generalization performance, outperforming other popular regularization methods. We provide insight into why our regularizer is effective and demonstrate that TANGOS can be applied jointly with existing methods to achieve even greater generalization performance",

    "abstract": "Message Passing Neural Networks (MPNNs) are a widely used class of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). The limited representational power of MPNNs inspires the study of provably powerful GNN architectures. However, knowing one model is more powerful than another gives little insight about what functions they can or cannot express. It is still unclear whether these models are able to approximate specific functions such as counting certain graph substructures, which is essential for applications in biology, chemistry and social network analysis. Motivated by this, we propose to study the counting power of Subgraph MPNNs, a recent and popular class of powerful GNN models that extract rooted subgraphs for each node, assign the root node a unique identifier and encode the root node's representation within its rooted subgraph. Specifically, we prove that Subgraph MPNNs fail to count more-than-4-cycles at node level, implying that node representations cannot correctly encode the surrounding substructures like ring systems with more than four atoms. To overcome this limitation, we propose I$^2$-GNNs to extend Subgraph MPNNs by assigning different identifiers for the root node and its neighbors in each subgraph. I$^2$-GNNs' discriminative power is shown to be strictly stronger than Subgraph MPNNs and partially stronger than the 3-WL test. More importantly, I$^2$-GNNs are proven capable of counting all 3, 4, 5 and 6-cycles, covering common substructures like benzene rings in organic chemistry, while still keeping linear complexity. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first linear-time GNN model that can count 6-cycles with theoretical guarantees. We validate its counting power in cycle counting tasks and demonstrate its competitive performance in molecular prediction benchmarks",

However, we also show that output reachability and adversarial robustness of node-classifier MPNN can be verified formally when a limit on the degree of input graphs is given a priori.

The idea of real-time processing is especially important in audio domain as the human perception of sound is sensitive to any kind of disturbance in perceived signals, especially the lag between auditory and visual modalities. The rise of deep learning (DL) models complicated the landscape of signal processing. Although they often have superior quality compared to standard DSP methods, this advantage is diminished by higher latency. In this work we propose novel method for minimization of inference time latency and memory consumption, called Short-Term Memory Convolution (STMC) and its transposed counterpart. The main advantage of STMC is the low latency comparable to long short-term memory (LSTM) networks. Furthermore, the training of STMC-based models is faster and more stable as the method is based solely on convolutional neural networks (CNNs). In this study we demonstrate an application of this solution to a U-Net model for a speech separation task and GhostNet model in acoustic scene classification (ASC) task. In case of speech separation we achieved a 5-fold reduction in inference time and a 2-fold reduction in latency without affecting the output quality.

Despite it deeply exploiting the lexicon-representing capability of pre-trained language models, a crucial gap remains between language modeling and lexicon-weighting retrieval -- the former preferring certain or low-entropy words whereas the latter favoring pivot or high-entropy words -- becoming the main barrier to lexicon-weighting performance for large-scale retrieval. To bridge this gap, we propose a brand-new pre-training framework, lexicon-bottlenecked masked autoencoder (LexMAE), to learn importance-aware lexicon representations. Essentially, we present a lexicon-bottlenecked module between a normal language modeling encoder and a weakened decoder, where a continuous bag-of-words bottleneck is constructed to learn a lexicon-importance distribution in an unsupervised fashion. The pre-trained LexMAE is readily transferred to the lexicon-weighting retrieval via fine-tuning.

These two perspectives combine elegantly in neural latent variable models that constrain the relationship between latent variables and neural activity, modeled by simple tuning curve functions. This has recently been demonstrated using Gaussian processes, with applications to realistic and topologically relevant latent manifolds. Those and previous models, however, missed crucial shared coding properties of neural populations. We propose $\\textit{feature sharing}$ across neural tuning curves which significantly improves performance and helps optimization. We also propose a solution to the $\\textit{ensemble detection}$ problem, where different groups of neurons, i.e., ensembles, can be modulated by different latent manifolds. Achieved through a soft clustering of neurons during training, this allows for the separation of mixed neural populations in an unsupervised manner.

Training deep neural forecasters on the fly is notoriously challenging because of their limited ability to adapt to non-stationary environments and remember old knowledge. We argue that the fast adaptation capability of deep neural networks is critical and successful solutions require handling changes to both new and recurring patterns effectively. In this work, inspired by the Complementary Learning Systems (CLS) theory, we propose Fast and Slow learning Network (FSNet) as a novel framework to address the challenges of online forecasting. Particularly, FSNet improves the slowly-learned backbone by dynamically balancing fast adaptation to recent changes and retrieving similar old knowledge. FSNet achieves this mechanism via an interaction between two novel complementary components: (i) a per-layer adapter to support fast learning from individual layers, and (ii) an associative memory to support remembering, updating, and recalling repeating events. Extensive experiments on real and synthetic datasets validate FSNet's efficacy and robustness to both new and recurring patterns.

In this paper, we propose Flipped Learning, an alternative method of meta-training which trains the LM to generate the task instruction given the input instance and label. During inference, the LM trained with Flipped Learning, referred to as FLIPPED, selects the label option that is most likely to generate the task instruction.

In these settings, performing actions at each time step quickly accumulates costs leading to vastly suboptimal outcomes. Additionally, repeatedly acting produces wear and tear and ultimately, damage. Determining when to act is crucial for achieving successful outcomes and yet, the challenge of efficiently learning to behave optimally when actions incur minimally bounded costs remains unresolved. In this paper, we intro- duce a reinforcement learning (RL) framework named Learnable Impulse Control Reinforcement Algorithm (LICRA), for learning to optimally select both when to act and which actions to take when actions incur costs. At the core of LICRA is a nested structure that combines RL and a form of policy known as impulse control which learns to maximise objectives when actions incur costs. We prove that LICRA, which seamlessly adopts any RL method, converges to policies that optimally select when to perform actions and their optimal magnitudes. We then augment LICRA to handle problems in which the agent can perform at most k < ∞ actions and more generally, faces a budget constraint. We show LICRA learns the optimal value function and ensures budget constraints are satisfied almost surely.

Prior arts approach to zero-shot captioning by either utilizing the existing large language models (e.g., GPT-2) or pre-training the encoder-decoder network in an end-to-end manner. However, the large language models may not generate sensible descriptions due to the task discrepancy between captioning and language modeling, while the end-to-end pre-training requires paired data and extensive computational resources. In this work, we propose a simple framework, named DeCap, for zero-shot captioning. We introduce a lightweight visual-aware language decoder. This decoder is both data-efficient and computation-efficient: 1) it only requires the \\textit{text} data for training, easing the burden on the collection of paired data. 2) it does not require end-to-end training. When trained with text-only data, the decoder takes the text embedding extracted from the off-the-shelf CLIP encoder as a prefix embedding. The challenge is that the decoder is trained on the text corpus but at the inference stage, it needs to generate captions based on visual inputs. Though the CLIP text embedding and the visual embedding are correlated, the \\textit{modality gap} issue is widely observed in multi-modal contrastive models that prevents us from directly taking the visual embedding as the prefix embedding. We propose a training-free mechanism to reduce the modality gap. We project the visual embedding into the CLIP text embedding space, while the projected embedding retains the information of the visual input. Taking the projected embedding as the prefix embedding, the decoder generates high-quality descriptions that match the visual input. The experiments show that DeCap outperforms other zero-shot captioning methods and unpaired captioning methods by a large margin on the typical image captioning benchmarks, i.e., MSCOCO and NoCaps. We apply DeCap to video captioning and achieve state-of-the-art zero-shot performance on MSR-VTT and ActivityNet-Captions. The code is available at https://github.com/dhg-wei/DeCap",

    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "Neural networks can be drastically shrunk in size by removing redundant parameters. While crucial for the deployment on resource-constraint hardware, oftentimes, compression comes with a severe drop in accuracy and lack of adversarial robustness. Despite recent advances, counteracting both aspects has only succeeded for moderate compression rates so far. We propose a novel method, HARP, that copes with aggressive pruning significantly better than prior work. For this, we consider the network holistically. We learn a global compression strategy that optimizes how many parameters (compression rate) and which parameters (scoring connections) to prune specific to each layer individually. Our method fine-tunes an existing model with dynamic regularization, that follows a step-wise incremental function balancing the different objectives. It starts by favoring robustness before shifting focus on reaching the target compression rate and only then handles the objectives equally. The learned compression strategies allow us to maintain the pre-trained model's natural accuracy and its adversarial robustness for a reduction by 99% of the network's original size. Moreover, we observe a crucial influence of non-uniform compression across layers. The implementation of HARP is publicly available at https://intellisec.de/research/harp",

Alas, the computational cost associated with Bayesian linear models constrains this method's application to small networks, small output spaces and small datasets. We address this limitation by introducing a scalable sample-based Bayesian inference method for conjugate Gaussian multi-output linear models, together with a matching method for hyperparameter (regularisation) selection. Furthermore, we use a classic feature normalisation method (the g-prior) to resolve a previously highlighted pathology of the linearised Laplace method.

    "title": "Defending against Adversarial Audio via Diffusion Model",
    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "Deep learning models have been widely used in commercial acoustic systems in recent years. However, adversarial audio examples can cause abnormal behaviors for those acoustic systems, while being hard for humans to perceive. Various methods, such as transformation-based defenses and adversarial training, have been proposed to protect acoustic systems from adversarial attacks, but they are less effective against adaptive attacks. Furthermore, directly applying the methods from the image domain can lead to suboptimal results because of the unique properties of audio data. In this paper, we propose an adversarial purification-based defense pipeline, AudioPure, for acoustic systems via off-the-shelf diffusion models. Taking advantage of the strong generation ability of diffusion models, AudioPure first adds a small amount of noise to the adversarial audio and then runs the reverse sampling step to purify the noisy audio and recover clean audio. AudioPure is a plug-and-play method that can be directly applied to any pretrained classifier without any fine-tuning or re-training. We conduct extensive experiments on the speech command recognition task to evaluate the robustness of AudioPure. Our method is effective against diverse adversarial attacks (e.g. L2 or L∞-norm). It outperforms the existing methods under both strong adaptive white-box and black-box attacks bounded by L2 or L∞-norm (up to +20% in robust accuracy). Besides, we also evaluate the certified robustness for perturbations bounded by L2-norm via randomized smoothing. Our pipeline achieves a higher certified accuracy than baselines",

    "title": "Theoretical Characterization of the Generalization Performance of Overfitted Meta-Learning",
    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "Meta-learning has arisen as a successful method for improving training performance by training over many similar tasks, especially with deep neural networks (DNNs). However, the theoretical understanding of when and why overparameterized models such as DNNs can generalize well in meta-learning is still limited. As an initial step towards addressing this challenge, this paper studies the generalization performance of overfitted meta-learning under a linear regression model with Gaussian features. In contrast to a few recent studies along the same line, our framework allows the number of model parameters to be arbitrarily larger than the number of features in the ground truth signal, and hence naturally captures the overparameterized regime in practical deep meta-learning. We show that the overfitted min $\\ell_2$-norm solution of model-agnostic meta-learning (MAML) can be beneficial, which is similar to the recent remarkable findings on \"benign overfitting\" and \"double descent\" phenomenon in the classical (single-task) linear regression. However, due to the uniqueness of meta-learning such as task-specific gradient descent inner training and the diversity/fluctuation of the ground-truth signals among training tasks, we find new and interesting properties that do not exist in single-task linear regression. We first provide a high-probability upper bound (under reasonable tightness) on the generalization error, where certain terms decrease when the number of features increases. Our analysis suggests that benign overfitting is more significant and easier to observe when the noise and the diversity/fluctuation of the ground truth of each training task are large. Under this circumstance, we show that the overfitted min $\\ell_2$-norm solution can achieve an even lower generalization error than the underparameterized solution",

However, popular explanations methods have been found to be fragile to minor perturbations of input features or model parameters. Relying on constraint relaxation techniques from non-convex optimization, we develop a method that upper-bounds the largest change an adversary can make to a gradient-based explanation via bounded manipulation of either the input features or model parameters. By propagating a compact input or parameter set as symbolic intervals through the forwards and backwards computations of the neural network we can formally certify the robustness of gradient-based explanations. Our bounds are differentiable, hence we can incorporate provable explanation robustness into neural network training. Empirically, our method surpasses the robustness provided by previous heuristic approaches. We find that our training method is the only method able to learn neural networks with certificates of explanation robustness across all six datasets tested",

    "title": "Offline Reinforcement Learning via High-Fidelity Generative Behavior Modeling",
    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "In offline reinforcement learning, weighted regression is a common method to ensure the learned policy stays close to the behavior policy and to prevent selecting out-of-sample actions. In this work, we show that due to the limited distributional expressivity of policy models, previous methods might still select unseen actions during training, which deviates from their initial motivation. To address this problem, we adopt a generative approach by decoupling the learned policy into two parts: an expressive generative behavior model and an action evaluation model. The key insight is that such decoupling avoids learning an explicitly parameterized policy model with a closed-form expression. Directly learning the behavior policy allows us to leverage existing advances in generative modeling, such as diffusion-based methods, to model diverse behaviors. As for action evaluation, we combine our method with an in-sample planning technique to further avoid selecting out-of-sample actions and increase computational efficiency. Experimental results on D4RL datasets show that our proposed method achieves competitive or superior performance compared with state-of-the-art offline RL methods, especially in complex tasks such as AntMaze. We also empirically demonstrate that our method can successfully learn from a heterogeneous dataset containing multiple distinctive but similarly successful strategies, whereas previous unimodal policies fail",

    "abstract": "Recently, it has been shown that neural networks not only approximate the ground-state wave functions of a single molecular system well but can also generalize to multiple geometries. While such generalization significantly speeds up training, each energy evaluation still requires Monte Carlo integration which limits the evaluation to a few geometries. In this work, we address the inference shortcomings by proposing the Potential learning from ab-initio Networks (PlaNet) framework, in which we simultaneously train a surrogate model in addition to the neural wave function. At inference time, the surrogate avoids expensive Monte-Carlo integration by directly estimating the energy, accelerating the process from hours to milliseconds. In this way, we can accurately model high-resolution multi-dimensional energy surfaces for larger systems that previously were unobtainable via neural wave functions. Finally, we explore an additional inductive bias by introducing physically-motivated restricted neural wave function models. We implement such a function with several additional improvements in the new PESNet++ model. In our experimental evaluation, PlaNet accelerates inference by 7 orders of magnitude for larger molecules like ethanol while preserving accuracy. Compared to previous energy surface networks, PESNet++ reduces energy errors by up to 74%",

In each round, the algorithm recommends one item per user, for which it gets a (noisy) reward sampled from a low-rank user-item preference matrix. The goal is to design a method with sub-linear regret (in $\\mathsf{T}$) and nearly optimal dependence on $\\mathsf{M}$ and $\\mathsf{N}$. The problem can be easily mapped to the standard multi-armed bandit problem where each item is an independent arm, but that leads to poor regret as the correlation between arms and users is not exploited. On the other hand, exploiting the low-rank structure of reward matrix is challenging due to non-convexity of the low-rank manifold. We first demonstrate that the low-rank structure can be exploited using a simple explore-then-commit (ETC) approach that ensures a regret of $O(\\mathsf{polylog} (\\mathsf{M}+\\mathsf{N}) \\mathsf{T}^{2/3})$. That is, roughly only $\\mathsf{polylog} (\\mathsf{M}+\\mathsf{N})$ item recommendations are required per user to get a non-trivial solution. We then improve our result for the rank-$1$ setting which in itself is quite challenging and encapsulates some of the key issues.

OCTAL is based on a novel technique of clustering users that allows iterative elimination of items and leads to a nearly optimal minimax rate",

We develop a novel scaffolding scheme where the teacher, in addition to setting a predictive target, also scaffolds the student's prediction by censoring hard-to-learn examples. Scaffolding utilizes the same information as the teacher's soft-max predictions as inputs, and in this sense, our proposal can be viewed as a natural variant of vanilla KD. We show on synthetic examples that censoring hard-examples leads to smoothening the student's loss landscape so that the student encounters fewer local minima. As a result, it has good generalization properties.

    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "Adaptive gradient methods such as Adam have gained increasing popularity in deep learning optimization. However, it has been observed in many deep learning applications such as image classification, Adam can converge to a different solution with a worse test error compared to (stochastic) gradient descent, even with a fine-tuned regularization. In this paper, we provide a theoretical explanation for this phenomenon: we show that in the nonconvex setting of learning over-parameterized two-layer convolutional neural networks starting from the same random initialization, for a class of data distributions (inspired from image data), Adam and gradient descent (GD) can converge to different global solutions of the training objective with provably different generalization errors, even with weight decay regularization. In contrast, we show that if the training objective is convex, and the weight decay regularization is employed, any optimization algorithms including Adam and GD will converge to the same solution if the training is successful. This suggests that the generalization gap between Adam and SGD in the presence of weight decay regularization is closely tied to the nonconvex landscape of deep learning optimization, which cannot be covered by the recent neural tangent kernel (NTK) based analysis",

This accuracy is typically measured in terms of a generalization error, that is, an expected value of a given loss function. However, for several applications --- for example in a security-critical context or for problems in the computational sciences --- accuracy in this sense is not sufficient. In such cases, one would like to have guarantees for high accuracy on every input value, that is, with respect to the uniform norm. In this paper we precisely quantify the number of training samples needed for any conceivable training algorithm to guarantee a given uniform accuracy on any learning problem formulated over target classes containing (or consisting of) ReLU neural networks of a prescribed architecture. We prove that, under very general assumptions, the minimal number of training samples for this task scales exponentially both in the depth and the input dimension of the network architecture",

    "abstract": "Open-ended learning methods that automatically generate a curriculum of increasingly challenging tasks serve as a promising avenue toward generally capable reinforcement learning agents. Existing methods adapt curricula independently over either environment parameters (in single-agent settings) or co-player policies (in multi-agent settings). However, the strengths and weaknesses of co-players can manifest themselves differently depending on environmental features. It is thus crucial to consider the dependency between the environment and co-player when shaping a curriculum in multi-agent domains. In this work, we use this insight and extend Unsupervised Environment Design (UED) to multi-agent environments. We then introduce Multi-Agent Environment Design Strategist for Open-Ended Learning (MAESTRO), the first multi-agent UED approach for two-player zero-sum settings. MAESTRO efficiently produces adversarial, joint curricula over both environments and co-players and attains minimax-regret guarantees at Nash equilibrium. Our experiments show that MAESTRO outperforms a number of strong baselines on competitive two-player games, spanning discrete and continuous control settings",

One technique to address this problem is transforming the single-player task through self-competition. The main idea is to compute a scalar baseline from the agent's historical performances and to reshape an episode's reward into a binary output, indicating whether the baseline has been exceeded or not. However, this baseline only carries limited information for the agent about strategies how to improve. We leverage the idea of self-competition and directly incorporate a historical policy into the planning process instead of its scalar performance. Based on the recently introduced Gumbel AlphaZero (GAZ), we propose our algorithm GAZ ‘Play-to-Plan' (GAZ PTP), in which the agent learns to find strong trajectories by planning against possible strategies of its past self. We show the effectiveness of our approach in two well-known combinatorial optimization problems, the Traveling Salesman Problem and the Job-Shop Scheduling Problem.

    "abstract": "Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection is essential for safety-critical applications of deep neural networks. OOD detection is challenging since DNN models may produce very high logits value even for OOD samples. Hence, it is of great difficulty to discriminate OOD data by directly adopting Softmax on output logits as the confidence score. Differently, we detect the OOD sample with Hopfield energy in a store-then-compare paradigm. In more detail, penultimate layer outputs on the training set are considered as the representations of in-distribution (ID) data. Thus they can be transformed into stored patterns that serve as anchors to measure the discrepancy of unseen data for OOD detection. Starting from the energy function defined in Modern Hopfield Network for the discrepancy score calculation, we derive a simplified version SHE with theoretical analysis. In SHE, we utilize only one stored pattern to present each class, and these patterns can be obtained by simply averaging the penultimate layer outputs of training samples within this class. SHE has the advantages of hyperparameterfree and high computational efficiency. The evaluations of nine widely-used OOD datasets show the promising performance of such a simple yet effective approach and its superiority over State-of-the-Art models.

In this work, we propose a new data-driven setup for offline MORL, where we wish to learn a preference-agnostic policy agent using only a finite dataset of offline demonstrations of other agents and their preferences. The key contributions of this work are two-fold. First, we introduce D4MORL, (D)atasets for MORL that are specifically designed for offline settings. It contains 1.8 million annotated demonstrations obtained by rolling out reference policies that optimize for randomly sampled preferences on 6 MuJoCo environments with 2-3 objectives each. Second, we propose Pareto-Efficient Decision Agents (PEDA), a family of offline MORL algorithms that builds and extends Decision Transformers via a novel preference-and-return-conditioned policy. Empirically, we show that PEDA closely approximates the behavioral policy on the D4MORL benchmark and provides an excellent approximation of the Pareto-front with appropriate conditioning, as measured by the hypervolume and sparsity metrics",

In this work, we observe that existing graph Transformers treat nodes as independent tokens and construct a single long sequence composed of all node tokens so as to train the Transformer model, causing it hard to scale to large graphs due to the quadratic complexity on the number of nodes for the self-attention computation. To this end, we propose a Neighborhood Aggregation Graph Transformer (NAGphormer) that treats each node as a sequence containing a series of tokens constructed by our proposed Hop2Token module. For each node, Hop2Token aggregates the neighborhood features from different hops into different representations and thereby produces a sequence of token vectors as one input. In this way, NAGphormer could be trained in a mini-batch manner and thus could scale to large graphs. Moreover, we mathematically show that as compared to a category of advanced Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), the decoupled Graph Convolutional Network, NAGphormer could learn more informative node representations from the multi-hop neighborhoods. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets from small to large are conducted to demonstrate that NAGphormer consistently outperforms existing graph Transformers and mainstream GNNs.

    "title": "Bayesian Oracle for bounding information gain in neural encoding models",
    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "In recent years, deep learning models have set new standards in predicting neural population responses. Most of these models currently focus on predicting the mean response of each neuron for a given input. However, neural variability around this mean is not just noise and plays a central role in several theories on neural computation. To capture this variability, we need models that predict full response distributions for a given stimulus. However, to measure the quality of such models, commonly used correlation-based metrics are not sufficient as they mainly care about the mean of the response distribution. An interpretable alternative evaluation metric for likelihood-based models is \\textit{Information Gain} (IG) which evaluates the likelihood of a model relative to a lower and upper bound. However, while a lower bound is usually easy to obtain, constructing an upper bound turns out to be challenging for neural recordings with relatively low numbers of repeated trials, high (shared) variability, and sparse responses. In this work, we generalize the jack-knife oracle estimator for the mean---commonly used for correlation metrics---to a flexible Bayesian oracle estimator for IG based on posterior predictive distributions. We describe and address the challenges that arise when estimating the lower and upper bounds from small datasets. We then show that our upper bound estimate is data-efficient and robust even in the case of sparse responses and low signal-to-noise ratio. We further provide the derivation of the upper bound estimator for a variety of common distributions including the state-of-the-art zero-inflated mixture models, and relate IG to common mean-based metrics. Finally, we use our approach to evaluate such a mixture model resulting in $90\\%$ IG performance",

    "abstract": "Differentiable neural architecture search (DARTS) is a popular method for neural architecture search (NAS), which performs cell-search and utilizes continuous relaxation to improve the search efficiency via gradient-based optimization. The main shortcoming of DARTS is performance collapse, where the discovered architecture suffers from a pattern of declining quality during search. Performance collapse has become an important topic of research, with many methods trying to solve the issue through either regularization or fundamental changes to DARTS. However, the weight-sharing framework used for cell-search in DARTS and the convergence of architecture parameters has not been analyzed yet. In this paper, we provide a thorough and novel theoretical and empirical analysis on DARTS and its point of convergence. We show that DARTS suffers from a specific structural flaw due to its weight-sharing framework that limits the convergence of DARTS to saturation points of the softmax function. This point of convergence gives an unfair advantage to layers closer to the output in choosing the optimal architecture, causing performance collapse. We then propose two new regularization terms that aim to prevent performance collapse by harmonizing operation selection via aligning gradients of layers. Experimental results on six different search spaces and three different datasets show that our method ($\\Lambda$-DARTS) does indeed prevent performance collapse, providing justification for our theoretical analysis and the proposed remedy",

    "abstract": "Cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) faces the challenge of adapting to multiple tasks with varying agents and targets. Previous multi-task MARL approaches require costly interactions to simultaneously learn or fine-tune policies in different tasks. However, the situation that an agent should generalize to multiple tasks with only offline data from limited tasks is more in line with the needs of real-world applications. Since offline multi-task data contains a variety of behaviors, an effective data-driven approach is to extract informative latent variables that can represent universal skills for realizing coordination across tasks. In this paper, we propose a novel Offline MARL algorithm to Discover coordInation Skills (ODIS) from multi-task data. ODIS first extracts task-invariant coordination skills from offline multi-task data and learns to delineate different agent behaviors with the discovered coordination skills. Then we train a coordination policy to choose optimal coordination skills with the centralized training and decentralized execution paradigm. We further demonstrate that the discovered coordination skills can assign effective coordinative behaviors, thus significantly enhancing generalization to unseen tasks. Empirical results in cooperative MARL benchmarks, including the StarCraft multi-agent challenge, show that ODIS obtains superior performance in a wide range of tasks only with offline data from limited sources",

    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "Low-rank approximation in data streams is a fundamental and significant task in computing science, machine learning and statistics. Multiple streaming algorithms have emerged over years and most of them are inspired by randomized algorithms, more specifically, sketching methods. However, many algorithms are not able to leverage information of data streams and consequently suffer from low accuracy. Existing data-driven methods improve accuracy but the training cost is expensive in practice. In this paper, from a subspace perspective, we propose a tensor-based sketching method for low-rank approximation of data streams. The proposed algorithm fully exploits the structure of data streams and obtains quasi-optimal sketching matrices by performing tensor decomposition on training data. A series of experiments are carried out and show that the proposed tensor-based method can be more accurate and much faster than the previous work",

    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "Tabular data is among the oldest and most ubiquitous forms of data. However, the generation of synthetic samples with the original data's characteristics remains a significant challenge for tabular data. While many generative models from the computer vision domain, such as variational autoencoders or generative adversarial networks, have been adapted for tabular data generation, less research has been directed towards recent transformer-based large language models (LLMs), which are also generative in nature. To this end, we propose GReaT (Generation of Realistic Tabular data), which exploits an auto-regressive generative LLM to sample synthetic and yet highly realistic tabular data. Furthermore, GReaT can model tabular data distributions by conditioning on any subset of features; the remaining features are sampled without additional overhead. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in a series of experiments that quantify the validity and quality of the produced data samples from multiple angles. We find that GReaT maintains state-of-the-art performance across numerous real-world and synthetic data sets with heterogeneous feature types coming in various sizes",

    "title": "Data augmentation alone can improve adversarial training",
    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "Adversarial training suffers from the issue of robust overfitting, which seriously impairs its generalization performance. Data augmentation, which is effective at preventing overfitting in standard training, has been observed by many previous works to be ineffective in mitigating overfitting in adversarial training. This work proves that, contrary to previous findings, data augmentation alone can significantly boost accuracy and robustness in adversarial training. We find that the hardness and the diversity of data augmentation are important factors in combating robust overfitting. In general, diversity can improve both accuracy and robustness, while hardness can boost robustness at the cost of accuracy within a certain limit and degrade them both over that limit. To mitigate robust overfitting, we first propose a new crop transformation Cropshift with improved diversity compared to the conventional one (Padcrop). We then propose a new data augmentation scheme, based on Cropshift, with much improved diversity and well-balanced hardness. Empirically, our augmentation method achieves the state-of-the-art accuracy and robustness for data augmentations in adversarial training. Furthermore, it matches, or even exceeds when combined with weight averaging, the performance of the best contemporary regularization methods for alleviating robust overfitting",

    "abstract": "Causal discovery from time-series data has been a central task in machine learning. Recently, Granger causality inference is gaining momentum due to its good explainability and high compatibility with emerging deep neural networks. However, most existing methods assume structured input data and degenerate greatly when encountering data with randomly missing entries or non-uniform sampling frequencies, which hampers their applications in real scenarios. To address this issue, here we present CUTS, a neural Granger causal discovery algorithm to jointly impute unobserved data points and build causal graphs, via plugging in two mutually boosting modules in an iterative framework: (i) Latent data prediction stage: designs a Delayed Supervision Graph Neural Network (DSGNN) to hallucinate and register unstructured data which might be of high dimension and with complex distribution; (ii) Causal graph fitting stage: builds a causal adjacency matrix with imputed data under sparse penalty. Experiments show that CUTS effectively infers causal graphs from irregular time-series data, with significantly superior performance to existing methods. Our approach constitutes a promising step towards applying causal discovery to real applications with non-ideal observations",

    "abstract": "We consider the general problem of recovering a high-dimensional signal from noisy quantized measurements. Quantization, especially coarse quantization such as 1-bit sign measurements, leads to severe information loss and thus a good prior knowledge of the unknown signal is helpful for accurate recovery. Motivated by the power of score-based generative models (SGM, also known as diffusion models) in capturing the rich structure of natural signals beyond simple sparsity, we propose an unsupervised data-driven approach called quantized compressed sensing with SGM (QCS-SGM), where the prior distribution is modeled by a pre-trained SGM. To perform posterior sampling, an annealed pseudo-likelihood score called ${\\textit{noise perturbed pseudo-likelihood score}}$ is introduced and combined with the prior score of SGM. The proposed QCS-SGM applies to an arbitrary number of quantization bits. Experiments on a variety of baseline datasets demonstrate that the proposed QCS-SGM significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art algorithms by a large margin for both in-distribution and out-of-distribution samples. Moreover, as a posterior sampling method, QCS-SGM can be easily used to obtain confidence intervals or uncertainty estimates of the reconstructed results. $\\textit{The code is available at}$ https://github.com/mengxiangming/QCS-SGM",

Saliency maps allow us to interpret which parts of the input signals have a strong influence on the prediction results. However, since a saliency map is obtained by complex computations in deep learning models, it is often difficult to know how reliable the saliency map itself is. In this study, we propose a method to quantify the reliability of a saliency region in the form of p-values. Our idea is to consider a saliency map as a selected hypothesis by the trained deep learning model and employ the selective inference framework. The proposed method provably provides a valid p-value for the detected salient region, i.e., we can provably control the false positive rate of the detected salient region. We demonstrate the validity of the proposed method through numerical examples in synthetic and real datasets. Furthermore, we develop a Keras-based framework for conducting the proposed selective inference for a wide class of CNNs without additional implementation cost",

Existing work shows that when prompted with a chain of thoughts (CoT), sequences of short sentences describing intermediate reasoning steps towards a final answer, large language models can generate new reasoning chains and predict answers for new inputs. A central question is which reasoning examples make the most effective prompts. In this work, we propose complexity-based prompting, a simple and effective example selection scheme for multi-step reasoning. We show that prompts with higher reasoning complexity, i.e., chains with more reasoning steps, achieve substantially better performance on math word reasoning tasks over strong baselines. We further extend our complexity-based criteria from prompting (selecting inputs) to decoding (selecting outputs), where we sample multiple reasoning chains from the model, then choose the majority of generated answers from complex reasoning chains (over simple chains). When used to prompt GPT-3, our approach substantially improves multi-step reasoning accuracy, with an 8.6% absolute improvement on GSM8K, and 6.4% on MathQA. Compared with existing example selection schemes like manual tuning or retrieval-based selection, selection based on reasoning complexity is intuitive, easy to implement, and annotation-efficient. Further results demonstrate the robustness of performance gains from complex prompts under format perturbation and distribution shift",

To address this, we propose a novel pre-training framework, named VaLM, to Visually-augment text tokens with retrieved relevant images for Language Modeling. Specifically, VaLM builds on a novel latent text-image alignment method via an image retrieval module to fetch corresponding images given a textual context. With the visually-augmented context, VaLM uses a visual knowledge fusion layer to enable multimodal grounded language modeling by attending on both text context and visual knowledge in images. We evaluate VaLM on various visual knowledge intensive commonsense reasoning tasks, which require visual information to excel. The experimental results illustrate that VaLM outperforms all strong language-only and vision-language baselines with substantial gains on reasoning object commonsense including color, size, and shape",

Our method is simpler than existing approaches for incremental learning, and more efficient in terms of model size, storage, and computation: it requires only a single, fixed-capacity autoencoding network with a feature space that is used for both discriminative and generative purposes. Network parameters are optimized simultaneously without architectural manipulations, by solving a constrained minimax game between the encoding and decoding maps over a single rate reduction-based objective. Experimental results show that our method can effectively alleviate catastrophic forgetting, achieving significantly better performance than prior work of generative replay on MNIST, CIFAR-10, and ImageNet-50, despite requiring fewer resources",

    "title": "When Data Geometry Meets Deep Function: Generalizing Offline Reinforcement Learning",
    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "In offline reinforcement learning (RL), one detrimental issue to policy learning is the error accumulation of deep \\textit{Q} function in out-of-distribution (OOD) areas. Unfortunately, existing offline RL methods are often over-conservative, inevitably hurting generalization performance outside data distribution. In our study, one interesting observation is that deep \\textit{Q} functions approximate well inside the convex hull of training data. Inspired by this, we propose a new method, \\textit{DOGE (Distance-sensitive Offline RL with better GEneralization)}. DOGE marries dataset geometry with deep function approximators in offline RL, and enables exploitation in generalizable OOD areas rather than strictly constraining policy within data distribution. Specifically, DOGE trains a state-conditioned distance function that can be readily plugged into standard actor-critic methods as a policy constraint. Simple yet elegant, our algorithm enjoys better generalization compared to state-of-the-art methods on D4RL benchmarks. Theoretical analysis demonstrates the superiority of our approach to existing methods that are solely based on data distribution or support constraints.

In this paper, we address the problem by proposing a framework that enables the training process under \\textit{any training budget} from the perspective of model structure, while achieving competitive model performances. Specifically, based on the observation that Transformer exhibits different levels of model redundancies at different training stages, we propose to dynamically control the activation rate of the model structure along the training process and meet the demand on the training budget by adjusting the duration on each level of model complexity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework is applicable to various Vision Transformers, and achieves competitive performances on a wide range of training budgets",

    "title": "Winning Both the Accuracy of Floating Point Activation and the Simplicity of Integer Arithmetic",
    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "Even though floating point (FP) numbers have been adopted as a de facto standard data format for deep learning computing, the complexity of FP arithmetic impedes a broader deployment of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs). Recent works such as quantization have attempted to replace the FP matrix multiplication (MatMul) of DNNs with simple integer MatMul by transforming the datatypes of both weights and activations into integers. Unfortunately, unlike weight values that are static, it is challenging to represent dynamic activations with integers. In this paper, to simultaneously achieve the accuracy of FP activation and the simplicity of integer arithmetic, we present a method for replacing FP arithmetic with integer one without changing FP activations in the storage format while weights are quantized. The proposed method pre-aligns the significands of FP activations just ahead of the MatMul on-the-fly so that the aligned significands (integers) can be used for the computation. Inspired by an observation that conventional FP arithmetic does not produce precise results due to rounding, we demonstrate that our proposed integer arithmetic-based scheme can produce the same level of errors as that of the FP arithmetic in case DNNs use FP activations and quantized weights. Experimental results show that the hardware based on the proposed scheme shows significant improvement over FP arithmetic-based designs in terms of energy efficiency and throughput-per-area while maintaining a similar level of accuracy",

    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "Edges in many real-world social/information networks are associated with rich text information (e.g., user-user communications or user-product reviews). However, mainstream network representation learning models focus on propagating and aggregating node attributes, lacking specific designs to utilize text semantics on edges. While there exist edge-aware graph neural networks, they directly initialize edge attributes as a feature vector, which cannot fully capture the contextualized text semantics of edges. In this paper, we propose Edgeformers, a framework built upon graph-enhanced Transformers, to perform edge and node representation learning by modeling texts on edges in a contextualized way. Specifically, in edge representation learning, we inject network information into each Transformer layer when encoding edge texts; in node representation learning, we aggregate edge representations through an attention mechanism within each node's ego-graph. On five public datasets from three different domains, Edgeformers consistently outperform state-of-the-art baselines in edge classification and link prediction, demonstrating the efficacy in learning edge and node representations, respectively",

    "title": "On Compositional Uncertainty Quantification for Seq2seq Graph Parsing",
    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "Recent years have witnessed the success of applying seq2seq models to graph parsing tasks, where the outputs are compositionally structured (e.g., a graph or a tree). However, these seq2seq approaches pose a challenge in quantifying the model's compositional uncertainty on graph structures due to the gap between seq2seq output probability and structural probability on the graph. This work is the first to quantify and evaluate compositional uncertainty for seq2seq graph parsing tasks. First, we proposed a generic, probabilistically interpretable framework that allows correspondences between seq2seq output probability to structural probability on the graph. This framework serves as a powerful medium for quantifying a seq2seq model's compositional uncertainty on graph elements (i.e., nodes or edges). Second, to evaluate uncertainty quality in terms of calibration, we propose a novel metric called Compositional Expected Calibration Error (CECE) which can measure a model's calibration behavior in predicting graph structures. By a thorough evaluation for compositional uncertainty on three different tasks across ten domains, we demonstrate that CECE is a better reflection for distributional shift compared to vanilla sequence ECE. Finally, we validate the effectiveness of compositional uncertainty considering the task of collaborative semantic parsing, where the model is allowed to send limited subgraphs for human review. The results show that the collaborative performance based on uncertain subgraph selection consistently outperforms random subgraph selection (30% average error reduction rate) and performs comparably to oracle subgraph selection (only 0.33 difference in average prediction error), indicating that compositional uncertainty is an ideal signal for model errors and can benefit various downstream tasks",

Among various approaches, exploiting invariant features by Domain Adversarial Training (DAT) received widespread attention. Despite its success, we observe training instability from DAT, mostly due to over-confident domain discriminator and environment label noise. To address this issue, we proposed Environment Label Smoothing (ELS), which encourages the discriminator to output soft probability, which thus reduces the confidence of the discriminator and alleviates the impact of noisy environment labels. We demonstrate, both experimentally and theoretically, that ELS can improve training stability, local convergence, and robustness to noisy environment labels. By incorporating ELS with DAT methods, we are able to yield state-of-art results on a wide range of domain generalization/adaptation tasks, particularly when the environment labels are highly noisy",

Human studies have revealed that, contrary to popular belief, objects referred to or pointed to do not lie on the elbow-wrist line, but rather on the so-called virtual touch line. Nevertheless, contemporary human pose representations lack the virtual touch line. To tackle this problem, we devise the touch-line Transformer: It takes as input tokenized visual and textual features and simultaneously predicts the referent's bounding box and a touch-line vector. Leveraging this touch-line prior, we further devise a geometric consistency loss that promotes co-linearity between referents and touch lines. Using the touch line as gestural information dramatically improves model performances: Experiments on the YouRefIt dataset demonstrate that our method yields a +25.0% accuracy improvement under the 0.75 IoU criterion, hence closing 63.6% of the performance difference between models and humans. Furthermore, we computationally validate prior human studies by demonstrating that computational models more accurately locate referents when employing the virtual touch line than when using the elbow-wrist line",

    "title": "Calibration Matters: Tackling Maximization Bias in Large-scale Advertising Recommendation Systems",
    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "Calibration is defined as the ratio of the average predicted click rate to the true click rate. The optimization of calibration is essential to many online advertising recommendation systems because it directly affects the downstream bids in ads auctions and the amount of money charged to advertisers. Despite its importance, calibration often suffers from a problem called \"maximization bias\". Maximization bias refers to the phenomenon that the maximum of predicted values overestimates the true maximum. The problem is introduced because the calibration is computed on the set selected by the prediction model itself. It persists even if unbiased predictions are achieved on every datapoint and worsens when covariate shifts exist between the training and test sets. To mitigate this problem, we quantify maximization bias and propose a variance-adjusting debiasing (VAD) meta-algorithm in this paper. The algorithm is efficient, robust, and practical as it is able to mitigate maximization bias problem under covariate shifts, without incurring additional online serving costs or compromising the ranking performance. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm using a state-of-the-art recommendation neural network model on a large-scale real-world dataset",

    "title": "Memorization-Dilation: Modeling Neural Collapse Under Noise",

    "abstract": "The notion of neural collapse refers to several emergent phenomena that have been empirically observed across various canonical classification problems. During the terminal phase of training a deep neural network, the feature embedding of all examples of the same class tend to collapse to a single representation, and the features of different classes tend to separate as much as possible. Neural collapse is often studied through a simplified model, called the layer-peeled model, in which the network is assumed to have ``infinite expressivity'' and can map each data point to any arbitrary representation. In this work we study a more realistic variant of the layer-peeled model, which takes the positivity of the features into account. Furthermore, we extend this model to also incorporate the limited expressivity of the network. Empirical evidence suggests that the memorization of noisy data points leads to a degradation (dilation) of the neural collapse. Using a model of the memorization-dilation (M-D) phenomenon, we show one mechanism by which different losses lead to different performances of the trained network on noisy data. Our proofs reveal why label smoothing, a modification of cross-entropy empirically observed to produce a regularization effect, leads to improved generalization in classification tasks",

This chronological order allows us to naturally represent directed edges via imposing the correct ordering when the nodes are embedded as events in the spacetime. Previous work in machine learning only considers embeddings lying on the simplest Lorentz manifold or does not exploit the connection between Lorentzian pre-length spaces and directed graphs.

This is accomplished by noting that under certain conditions, a \"transductive\" reparameterization can convert an out-of-support extrapolation problem into a problem of within-support combinatorial generalization. We propose a simple strategy based on bilinear embeddings to enable this type of combinatorial generalization, thereby addressing the out-of-support extrapolation problem under certain conditions.

    "abstract": "Concept bottleneck models (CBM) are a popular way of creating more interpretable neural networks by having hidden layer neurons correspond to human-understandable concepts. However, existing CBMs and their variants have two crucial limitations: first, they need to collect labeled data for each of the predefined concepts, which is time consuming and labor intensive; second, the accuracy of a CBM is often significantly lower than that of a standard neural network, especially on more complex datasets. This poor performance creates a barrier for adopting CBMs in practical real world applications. Motivated by these challenges, we propose Label-free CBM which is a novel framework to transform any neural network into an interpretable CBM without labeled concept data, while retaining a high accuracy. Our Label-free CBM has many advantages, it is: scalable - we present the first CBM scaled to ImageNet, efficient - creating a CBM takes only a few hours even for very large datasets, and automated - training it for a new dataset requires minimal human effort.

In this paper, we introduce the pre-training process of GLM-130B including its design choices, training strategies for both efficiency and stability, and engineering efforts. The resultant GLM-130B model offers significant outperformance over GPT-3 175B on a wide range of popular English benchmarks while the performance advantage is not observed in OPT-175B and BLOOM-176B.

    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "Consider the problem of estimating the causal effect of some attribute of a text document; for example: what effect does writing a polite vs. rude email have on response time? To estimate a causal effect from observational data, we need to adjust for confounding aspects of the text that affect both the treatment and outcome---e.g., the topic or writing level of the text. These confounding aspects are unknown a priori, so it seems natural to adjust for the entirety of the text (e.g., using a transformer). However, causal identification and estimation procedures rely on the assumption of overlap: for all levels of the adjustment variables, there is randomness leftover so that every unit could have (not) received treatment. Since the treatment here is itself an attribute of the text, it is perfectly determined, and overlap is apparently violated. The purpose of this paper is to show how to handle causal identification and obtain robust causal estimation in the presence of apparent overlap violations. In brief, the idea is to use supervised representation learning to produce a data representation that preserves confounding information while eliminating information that is only predictive of the treatment. This representation then suffices for adjustment and satisfies overlap. Adapting results on non-parametric estimation, we show that this procedure shows robustness with respect to conditional outcome misestimation and yields a low-bias estimator that admits valid uncertainty quantification under weak conditions. Empirical results show reductions in bias and strong improvements in uncertainty quantification relative to the natural (transformer-based) baseline",

Model-based RL has the potential to be highly sample efficient by concurrently learning a world model and using synthetic rollouts for planning and policy improvement. However, in practice, sample-efficient learning with model-based RL is bottlenecked by the exploration challenge. In this work, we find that leveraging just a handful of demonstrations can dramatically improve the sample-efficiency of model-based RL. Simply appending demonstrations to the interaction dataset, however, does not suffice. We identify key ingredients for leveraging demonstrations in model learning -- policy pretraining, targeted exploration, and oversampling of demonstration data -- which forms the three phases of our model-based RL framework.

Hence, obtaining a set of Pareto front solutions for the entire preference space in a given domain with a single training is critical. To this end, we propose a novel MORL algorithm that trains a single universal network to cover the entire preference space scalable to continuous robotic tasks. The proposed approach, Preference-Driven MORL (PD-MORL), utilizes the preferences as guidance to update the network parameters. It also employs a novel parallelization approach to increase sample efficiency.

We have two major theoretical discoveries. First, the presence of nonlinearity can lead to many local optima even in 1-layer setting, each corresponding to certain patterns from the data distribution, while with linear activation, only one major pattern can be learned. This suggests that models with lots of parameters can be regarded as a \\emph{brute-force} way to find these local optima induced by nonlinearity. Second, in the 2-layer case, linear activation is proven not capable of learning specialized weights into diverse patterns, demonstrating the importance of nonlinearity. In addition, for 2-layer setting, we also discover \\emph{global modulation}: those local patterns discriminative from the perspective of global-level patterns are prioritized to learn, further characterizing the learning process.

    "abstract": "Learning to Optimize (L2O) has drawn increasing attention as it often remarkably accelerates the optimization procedure of complex tasks by \"overfitting\" specific task type, leading to enhanced performance compared to analytical optimizers. Generally, L2O develops a parameterized optimization method (i.e., \"optimizer\") by learning from solving sample problems. This data-driven procedure yields L2O that can efficiently solve problems similar to those seen in training, that is, drawn from the same \"task distribution\". However, such learned optimizers often struggle when new test problems come with a substantially deviation from the training task distribution. This paper investigates a potential solution to this open challenge, by meta-training an L2O optimizer that can perform fast test-time self-adaptation to a out-of-distribution task, in only a few steps. We theoretically characterize the generalization of L2O, and further show that our proposed framework (termed as M-L2O) provably facilitates rapid task adaptation by locating well-adapted initial points for the optimizer weight. Empirical observations on several classic tasks like LASSO and Quadratic, demonstrate that M-L2O converges significantly faster than vanilla L2O with only $5$ steps of adaptation, echoing our theoretical results.

Hierarchical transformers (e.g., Swin Transformers) reintroduced several ConvNet priors and further enhanced the practical viability of adapting volumetric segmentation in 3D medical datasets. The effectiveness of hybrid approaches is largely credited to the large receptive field for non-local self-attention and the large number of model parameters. We hypothesize that volumetric ConvNets can simulate the large receptive field behavior of these learning approaches with fewer model parameters using depth-wise convolution. In this work, we propose a lightweight volumetric ConvNet, termed 3D UX-Net, which adapts the hierarchical transformer using ConvNet modules for robust volumetric segmentation. Specifically, we revisit volumetric depth-wise convolutions with large kernel (LK) size (e.g. starting from $7\\times7\\times7$) to enable the larger global receptive fields, inspired by Swin Transformer. We further substitute the multi-layer perceptron (MLP) in Swin Transformer blocks with pointwise depth convolutions and enhance model performances with fewer normalization and activation layers, thus reducing the number of model parameters. 3D UX-Net competes favorably with current SOTA transformers (e.g. SwinUNETR) using three challenging public datasets on volumetric brain and abdominal imaging: 1) MICCAI Challenge 2021 FLARE, 2) MICCAI Challenge 2021 FeTA, and 3) MICCAI Challenge 2022 AMOS. 3D UX-Net consistently outperforms SwinUNETR with improvement from 0.929 to 0.938 Dice (FLARE2021) and 0.867 to 0.874 Dice (Feta2021). We further evaluate the transfer learning capability of 3D UX-Net with AMOS2022 and demonstrates another improvement of $2.27\\%$ Dice (from 0.880 to 0.900).

    "abstract": "Research in mechanistic interpretability seeks to explain behaviors of ML models in terms of their internal components. However, most previous work either focuses on simple behaviors in small models, or describes complicated behaviors in larger models with broad strokes. In this work, we bridge this gap by presenting an explanation for how GPT-2 small performs a natural language task that requires logical reasoning: indirect object identification (IOI). Our explanation encompasses 28 attention heads grouped into 7 main classes, which we discovered using a combination of interpretability approaches including causal interventions and projections. To our knowledge, this investigation is the largest end-to-end attempt at reverse-engineering a natural behavior \"in the wild\" in a language model. We evaluate the reliability of our explanation using three quantitative criteria - faithfulness, completeness and minimality. Though these criteria support our explanation, they also point to remaining gaps in our understanding. Our work provides evidence that a mechanistic understanding of large ML models is feasible, opening opportunities to scale our understanding to both larger models and more complex tasks",

    "abstract": "End-to-end learning for visual robotic manipulation is known to suffer from sample inefficiency, requiring large numbers of demonstrations. The spatial roto-translation equivariance, or the SE(3)-equivariance can be exploited to improve the sample efficiency for learning robotic manipulation. In this paper, we present SE(3)-equivariant models for visual robotic manipulation from point clouds that can be trained fully end-to-end. By utilizing the representation theory of the Lie group, we construct novel SE(3)-equivariant energy-based models that allow highly sample efficient end-to-end learning. We show that our models can learn from scratch without prior knowledge and yet are highly sample efficient (5~10 demonstrations are enough). Furthermore, we show that our models can generalize to tasks with (i) previously unseen target object poses, (ii) previously unseen target object instances of the category, and (iii) previously unseen visual distractors.

    "abstract": "While GNN explanation has recently received significant attention, existing works are consistently designed for static graphs. Due to the prevalence of temporal graphs, many temporal graph models have been proposed, but explaining their predictions remains to be explored. To bridge the gap, in this paper, we propose T-GNNExplainer for temporal graph model explanation. Specifically, we regard a temporal graph constituted by a sequence of temporal events. Given a target event, our task is to find a subset of previously occurred events that lead to the model's prediction for it. To handle this combinatorial optimization problem, T-GNNExplainer includes an explorer to find the event subsets with Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) and a navigator that learns the correlations between events and helps reduce the search space. In particular, the navigator is trained in advance and then integrated with the explorer to speed up searching and achieve better results. To the best of our knowledge, T-GNNExplainer is the first explainer tailored for temporal graph models. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the performance of T-GNNExplainer. Experimental results on both real-world and synthetic datasets demonstrate that T-GNNExplainer can achieve superior performance with up to about 50% improvement in Area under Fidelity-Sparsity Curve",

    "title": "Soft Neighbors are Positive Supporters in Contrastive Visual Representation Learning",
    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "Contrastive learning methods train visual encoders by comparing views (e.g., often created via a group of data augmentations on the same instance) from one instance to others. Typically, the views created from one instance are set as positive, while views from other instances are negative. This binary instance discrimination is studied extensively to improve feature representations in self-supervised learning. In this paper, we rethink the instance discrimination framework and find the binary instance labeling insufficient to measure correlations between different samples. For an intuitive example, given a random image instance, there may exist other images in a mini-batch whose content meanings are the same (i.e., belonging to the same category) or partially related (i.e., belonging to a similar category). How to treat the images that correlate similarly to the current image instance leaves an unexplored problem. We thus propose to support the current image by exploring other correlated instances (i.e., soft neighbors). We first carefully cultivate a candidate neighbor set, which will be further utilized to explore the highly-correlated instances. A cross-attention module is then introduced to predict the correlation score (denoted as positiveness) of other correlated instances with respect to the current one. The positiveness score quantitatively measures the positive support from each correlated instance, and is encoded into the objective for pretext training. To this end, our proposed method benefits in discriminating uncorrelated instances while absorbing correlated instances for SSL. We evaluate our soft neighbor contrastive learning method (SNCLR) on standard visual recognition benchmarks, including image classification, object detection, and instance segmentation. The state-of-the-art recognition performance shows that SNCLR is effective in improving feature representations from both ViT and CNN encoders",

This issue can be addressed by finetuning such models via supervised learning on curated datasets, or via reinforcement learning. In this work, we propose a novel offline RL method, implicit language Q-learning (ILQL), designed for use on language models, that combines both the flexible utility maximization framework of RL algorithms with the ability of supervised learning to leverage previously collected data, as well as its simplicity and stability. Our method employs a combination of value conservatism alongside an implicit dataset support constraint in learning value functions, which are then used to guide language model generations towards maximizing user-specified utility functions. In addition to empirically validating ILQL, we present a detailed empirical analysis of situations where offline RL can be useful in natural language generation settings, demonstrating how it can be a more effective utility optimizer than prior approaches for end-to-end dialogue, and how it can effectively optimize high variance reward functions based on subjective judgement, such as whether to label a comment as toxic or not",

    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "Recent years have seen progress beyond domain-specific sound separation for speech or music towards universal sound separation for arbitrary sounds. Prior work on universal sound separation has investigated separating a target sound out of an audio mixture given a text query. Such text-queried sound separation systems provide a natural and scalable interface for specifying arbitrary target sounds. However, supervised text-queried sound separation systems require costly labeled audio-text pairs for training. Moreover, the audio provided in existing datasets is often recorded in a controlled environment, causing a considerable generalization gap to noisy audio in the wild. In this work, we aim to approach text-queried universal sound separation by using only unlabeled data. We propose to leverage the visual modality as a bridge to learn the desired audio-textual correspondence. The proposed CLIPSep model first encodes the input query into a query vector using the contrastive language-image pretraining (CLIP) model, and the query vector is then used to condition an audio separation model to separate out the target sound. While the model is trained on image-audio pairs extracted from unlabeled videos, at test time we can instead query the model with text inputs in a zero-shot setting, thanks to the joint language-image embedding learned by the CLIP model. Further, videos in the wild often contain off-screen sounds and background noise that may hinder the model from learning the desired audio-textual correspondence. To address this problem, we further propose an approach called noise invariant training for training a query-based sound separation model on noisy data. Experimental results show that the proposed models successfully learn text-queried universal sound separation using only noisy unlabeled videos, even achieving competitive performance against a supervised model in some settings",

    "abstract": "As machine learning (ML) algorithms are increasingly used in high-stakes applications, concerns have arisen that they may be biased against certain social groups. Although many approaches have been proposed to make ML models fair, they typically rely on the assumption that data distributions in training and deployment are identical. Unfortunately, this is commonly violated in practice and a model that is fair during training may lead to an unexpected outcome during its deployment. Although the problem of designing robust ML models under dataset shifts has been widely studied, most existing works focus only on the transfer of accuracy. In this paper, we study the transfer of both fairness and accuracy under domain generalization where the data at test time may be sampled from never-before-seen domains. We first develop theoretical bounds on the unfairness and expected loss at deployment, and then derive sufficient conditions under which fairness and accuracy can be perfectly transferred via invariant representation learning. Guided by this, we design a learning algorithm such that fair ML models learned with training data still have high fairness and accuracy when deployment environments change. Experiments on real-world data validate the proposed algorithm",

Self-play has proven useful in games such as Go, and thus it is natural to ask whether LMs can generate their own instructive programming problems to improve their performance. We show that it is possible for an LM to synthesize programming problems and solutions, which are filtered for correctness by a Python interpreter. The LM's performance is then seen to improve when it is fine-tuned on its own synthetic problems and verified solutions; thus the model \"improves itself\" using the Python interpreter. Problems are specified formally as programming puzzles [Schuster et al. , 2021], a code-based problem format where solutions can easily be verified for correctness by execution.

Tackling this issue, we propose Latent Bottlenecked Attentive Neural Processes (LBANPs), a new computationally efficient sub-quadratic NP variant, that has a querying computational complexity independent of the number of context datapoints. The model encodes the context dataset into a constant number of latent vectors on which self-attention is performed. When making predictions, the model retrieves higher-order information from the context dataset via multiple cross-attention mechanisms on the latent vectors. We empirically show that LBANPs achieve results competitive with the state-of-the-art on meta-regression, image completion, and contextual multi-armed bandits.

(i) It often takes the full history to predict the future, which induces a sample complexity that scales exponentially with the horizon. (ii) The observation and state spaces are often continuous, which induces a sample complexity that scales exponentially with the extrinsic dimension. Addressing such challenges requires learning a minimal but sufficient representation of the observation and state histories by exploiting the structure of the POMDP. To this end, we propose a reinforcement learning algorithm named Represent to Control (RTC), which learns the representation at two levels while optimizing the policy.~(i) For each step, RTC learns to represent the state with a low-dimensional feature, which factorizes the transition kernel. (ii) Across multiple steps, RTC learns to represent the full history with a low-dimensional embedding, which assembles the per-step feature. We integrate (i) and (ii) in a unified framework that allows a variety of estimators (including maximum likelihood estimators and generative adversarial networks). For a class of POMDPs with a low-rank structure in the transition kernel, RTC attains an $O(1/\\epsilon^2)$ sample complexity that scales polynomially with the horizon and the intrinsic dimension (that is, the rank). Here $\\epsilon$ is the optimality gap.

In LipsFormer, we replace unstable Transformer component modules with Lipschitz continuous counterparts: CenterNorm instead of LayerNorm, spectral initialization instead of Xavier initialization, scaled cosine similarity attention instead of dot-product attention, and weighted residual shortcut. We prove that these introduced modules are Lipschitz continuous and derive an upper bound on the Lipschitz constant of LipsFormer.

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) can carry out complex reasoning tasks by generating intermediate reasoning steps. These steps are triggered by what is called chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting, which comes in two flavors: one leverages a simple prompt like \"Let's think step by step\" to facilitate step-by-step reasoning before answering a question (Zero-Shot-CoT). The other uses manual demonstrations, each composed of a question and a reasoning chain that leads to an answer (Manual-CoT). Unfortunately, the superior performance of the latter strategy crucially hinges on manually generating task-specific demonstrations. This makes it far less scalable and more dependent on the talent of the CoT engineer. We show that such manual efforts may be eliminated by leveraging LLMs to generate the reasoning chains on its own. Since these generated chains often come with mistakes we propose a number of mitigation strategies. Our proposed Auto-CoT method automaticaly samples diverse questions and we perform post-processing quality control to generate usable reasoning chains from Zero-Shot-CoT.

However, obtaining good results while keeping a low model complexity remains challenging in real-world applications. In this paper, we provide a bio-inspired efficient encoder-decoder architecture by mimicking the brain's top-down attention, called TDANet, with decreased model complexity without sacrificing performance. The top-down attention in TDANet is extracted by the global attention (GA) module and the cascaded local attention (LA) layers. The GA module takes multi-scale acoustic features as input to extract global attention signal, which then modulates features of different scales by direct top-down connections. The LA layers use features of adjacent layers as input to extract the local attention signal, which is used to modulate the lateral input in a top-down manner. On three benchmark datasets, TDANet consistently achieved competitive separation performance to previous state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods with higher efficiency. Specifically, TDANet's multiply-accumulate operations (MACs) are only 5% of Sepformer, one of the previous SOTA models, and CPU inference time is only 10% of Sepformer. In addition, a large-size version of TDANet obtained SOTA results on three datasets, with MACs still only 10% of Sepformer and the CPU inference time only 24% of Sepformer. Our study suggests that top-down attention can be a more efficient strategy for speech separation",

    "title": "Machine Unlearning of Federated Clusters",
    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "Federated clustering (FC) is an unsupervised learning problem that arises in a number of practical applications, including personalized recommender and healthcare systems. With the adoption of recent laws ensuring the \"right to be forgotten\", the problem of machine unlearning for FC methods has become of significant importance. We introduce, for the first time, the problem of machine unlearning for FC, and propose an efficient unlearning mechanism for a customized secure FC framework. Our FC framework utilizes special initialization procedures that we show are well-suited for unlearning. To protect client data privacy, we develop the secure compressed multiset aggregation (SCMA) framework that addresses sparse secure federated learning (FL) problems encountered during clustering as well as more general problems. To simultaneously facilitate low communication complexity and secret sharing protocols, we integrate Reed-Solomon encoding with special evaluation points into our SCMA pipeline, and prove that the client communication cost is logarithmic in the vector dimension. Additionally, to demonstrate the benefits of our unlearning mechanism over complete retraining, we provide a theoretical analysis for the unlearning performance of our approach. Simulation results show that the new FC framework exhibits superior clustering performance compared to previously reported FC baselines when the cluster sizes are highly imbalanced. Compared to completely retraining K-means++ locally and globally for each removal request, our unlearning procedure offers an average speed-up of roughly 84x across seven datasets.

    "title": "Moderate Coreset: A Universal Method of Data Selection for Real-world Data-efficient Deep Learning",
    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "Deep learning methods nowadays rely on massive data, resulting in substantial costs of data storage and model training. Data selection is a useful tool to alleviate such costs, where a coreset of massive data is extracted to practically perform on par with full data. Based on carefully-designed score criteria, existing methods first count the score of each data point and then select the data points whose scores lie in a certain range to construct a coreset. These methods work well in their respective preconceived scenarios but are not robust to the change of scenarios, since the optimal range of scores varies as the scenario changes. The issue limits the application of these methods, because realistic scenarios often mismatch preconceived ones, and it is inconvenient or unfeasible to tune the criteria and methods accordingly. In this paper, to address the issue, a concept of the moderate coreset is discussed. Specifically, given any score criterion of data selection, different scenarios prefer data points with scores in different intervals. As the score median is a proxy of the score distribution in statistics, the data points with scores close to the score median can be seen as a proxy of full data and generalize different scenarios, which are used to construct the moderate coreset. As a proof-of-concept, a universal method that inherits the moderate coreset and uses the distance of a data point to its class center as the score criterion, is proposed to meet complex realistic scenarios. Extensive experiments confirm the advance of our method over prior state-of-the-art methods, leading to a strong baseline for future research.

    "abstract": "To protect user privacy and meet legal regulations, federated learning (FL) is attracting significant attention. Training neural machine translation (NMT) models with traditional FL algorithm (e.g., FedAvg) typically relies on multi-round model-based interactions. However, it is impractical and inefficient for machine translation tasks due to the vast communication overheads and heavy synchronization. In this paper, we propose a novel federated nearest neighbor (FedNN) machine translation framework that, instead of multi-round model-based interactions, leverages one-round memorization-based interaction to share knowledge across different clients to build low-overhead privacy-preserving systems. The whole approach equips the public NMT model trained on large-scale accessible data with a $k$-nearest-neighbor ($k$NN) classifier and integrates the external datastore constructed by private text data in all clients to form the final FL model. A two-phase datastore encryption strategy is introduced to achieve privacy-preserving during this process. Extensive experiments show that FedNN significantly reduces computational and communication costs compared with FedAvg, while maintaining promising performance in different FL settings",

Specifically, we develop a practically feasible robustness metric for general CO solvers. A no-worse optimal cost guarantee is developed as such the optimal solutions are not required to achieve for solvers, and we tackle the non-differentiable challenge in input instance disturbance by resorting to black-box adversarial attack methods. Extensive experiments are conducted on 14 unique combinations of solvers and CO problems, and we demonstrate that the performance of state-of-the-art solvers like Gurobi can degenerate by over 20% under the given time limit bound on the hard instances discovered by our robustness metric, raising concerns about the robustness of combinatorial optimization solvers",

    "abstract": "Human similarity judgments are a powerful supervision signal for machine learning applications based on techniques such as contrastive learning, information retrieval, and model alignment, but classical methods for collecting human similarity judgments are too expensive to be used at scale. Recent methods propose using pre-trained deep neural networks (DNNs) to approximate human similarity, but pre-trained DNNs may not be available for certain domains (e.g., medical images, low-resource languages) and their performance in approximating human similarity has not been extensively tested. We conducted an evaluation of 611 pre-trained models across three domains -- images, audio, video -- and found that there is a large gap in performance between human similarity judgments and pre-trained DNNs. To address this gap, we propose a new class of similarity approximation methods based on language. To collect the language data required by these new methods, we also developed and validated a novel adaptive tag collection pipeline. We find that our proposed language-based methods are significantly cheaper, in the number of human judgments, than classical methods, but still improve performance over the DNN-based methods. Finally, we also develop `stacked' methods that combine language embeddings with DNN embeddings, and find that these consistently provide the best approximations for human similarity across all three of our modalities. Based on the results of this comprehensive study, we provide a concise guide for researchers interested in collecting or approximating human similarity data. To accompany this guide, we also release all of the similarity and language data, a total of 206,339 human judgments, that we collected in our experiments, along with a detailed breakdown of all modeling results",

    "abstract": "Semi-supervised Learning (SSL) has witnessed great success owing to the impressive performances brought by various methods based on pseudo labeling and consistency regularization. However, we argue that existing methods might fail to utilize the unlabeled data more effectively since they either use a pre-defined / fixed threshold or an ad-hoc threshold adjusting scheme, resulting in inferior performance and slow convergence. We first analyze a motivating example to obtain intuitions on the relationship between the desirable threshold and model's learning status. Based on the analysis, we hence propose FreeMatch to adjust the confidence threshold in a self-adaptive manner according to the model's learning status. We further introduce a self-adaptive class fairness regularization penalty to encourage the model for diverse predictions during the early training stage. Extensive experiments indicate the superiority of FreeMatch especially when the labeled data are extremely rare. FreeMatch achieves 5.78%, 13.59%, and 1.28% error rate reduction over the latest state-of-the-art method FlexMatch on CIFAR-10 with 1 label per class, STL-10 with 4 labels per class, and ImageNet with 100 labels per class, respectively.

A representative class of algorithms exploits spectral decomposition of the stochastic transition dynamics to construct representations that enjoy strong theoretical properties in idealized settings. However, current spectral methods suffer from limited applicability because they are constructed for state-only aggregation and are derived from a policy-dependent transition kernel, without considering the issue of exploration. To address these issues, we propose an alternative spectral method, Spectral Decomposition Representation (SPEDER), that extracts a state-action abstraction from the dynamics without inducing spurious dependence on the data collection policy, while also balancing the exploration-versus-exploitation trade-off during learning. A theoretical analysis establishes the sample efficiency of the proposed algorithm in both the online and offline settings.

To this end, we propose SoftMatch to overcome the trade-off by maintaining both high quantity and high quality of pseudo-labels during training, effectively exploiting the unlabeled data.

However, when deploying trained communicative agents in a real-world application where noise and potential attackers exist, the safety of communication-based policies becomes a severe issue that is underexplored. Specifically, if communication messages are manipulated by malicious attackers, agents relying on untrustworthy communication may take unsafe actions that lead to catastrophic consequences. Therefore, it is crucial to ensure that agents will not be misled by corrupted communication, while still benefiting from benign communication. In this work, we consider an environment with $N$ agents, where the attacker may arbitrarily change the communication from any $C<\\frac{N-1}{2}$ agents to a victim agent. For this strong threat model, we propose a certifiable defense by constructing a message-ensemble policy that aggregates multiple randomly ablated message sets. Theoretical analysis shows that this message-ensemble policy can utilize benign communication while being certifiably robust to adversarial communication, regardless of the attacking algorithm. Experiments in multiple environments verify that our defense significantly improves the robustness of trained policies against various types of attacks",

However, to date, empirical evidence assessing the explanatory power of these hypotheses is lacking. In this paper, we conduct an extensive empirical evaluation, focusing on the ability of various theorized mechanisms to close the small-to-large batch generalization gap. Additionally, we characterize how the quantities that SGD has been claimed to (implicitly) regularize change over the course of training. By using micro-batches, i.e. disjoint smaller subsets of each mini-batch, we empirically show that explicitly penalizing the gradient norm or the Fisher Information Matrix trace, averaged over micro-batches, in the large-batch regime recovers small-batch SGD generalization, whereas Jacobian-based regularizations fail to do so. This generalization performance is shown to often be correlated with how well the regularized model's gradient norms resemble those of small-batch SGD. We additionally show that this behavior breaks down as the micro-batch size approaches the batch size. Finally, we note that in this line of inquiry, positive experimental findings on CIFAR10 are often reversed on other datasets like CIFAR100, highlighting the need to test hypotheses on a wider collection of datasets",

Though state-of-the-art models can generate high-quality images of common entities, they often have difficulty generating images of uncommon entities, such as `Chortai (dog)' or `Picarones (food)'. To tackle this issue, we present the Retrieval-Augmented Text-to-Image Generator (Re-Imagen), a generative model that uses retrieved information to produce high-fidelity and faithful images, even for rare or unseen entities. Given a text prompt, Re-Imagen accesses an external multi-modal knowledge base to retrieve relevant (image, text) pairs, and uses them as references to generate the image. With this retrieval step, Re-Imagen is augmented with the knowledge of high-level semantics and low-level visual details of the mentioned entities, and thus improves its accuracy in generating the entities' visual appearances. We train Re-Imagen on a constructed dataset containing (image,text,retrieval) triples to teach the model to ground on both text prompt and retrieval. Furthermore, we develop a new sampling strategy to interleave the classifier-free guidance for text and retrieval condition to balance the text and retrieval alignment. Re-Imagen achieves new SoTA FID results on two image generation benchmarks, such as COCO (\\ie, FID = 5.25) and WikiImage (\\ie, FID = 5.82) without fine-tuning. To further evaluate the capabilities of the model, we introduce EntityDrawBench, a new benchmark that evaluates image generation for diverse entities, from frequent to rare, across multiple visual domains. Human evaluation on EntityDrawBench shows that Re-Imagen performs on par with the best prior models in photo-realism, but with significantly better real-world faithfulness, especially on less frequent entities",

    "abstract": "Graph neural networks (GNNs) are prominent in the graph machine learning domain, owing to their strong performance across various tasks. A recent focal area is the space of graph self-supervised learning (SSL), which aims to derive useful node representations without labeled data. Notably, many state-of-the-art graph SSL methods are contrastive methods, which use a combination of positive and negative samples to learn node representations. Owing to challenges in negative sampling (slowness and model sensitivity), recent literature introduced non-contrastive methods, which instead only use positive samples. Though such methods have shown promising performance in node-level tasks, their suitability for link prediction tasks, which are concerned with predicting link existence between pairs of nodes (and have broad applicability to recommendation systems contexts) is yet unexplored. In this work, we extensively evaluate the performance of existing non-contrastive methods for link prediction in both transductive and inductive settings. While most existing non-contrastive methods perform poorly overall, we find that, surprisingly, BGRL generally performs well in transductive settings. However, it performs poorly in the more realistic inductive settings where the model has to generalize to links to/from unseen nodes. We find that non-contrastive models tend to overfit to the training graph and use this analysis to propose T-BGRL, a novel non-contrastive framework that incorporates cheap corruptions to improve the generalization ability of the model. This simple modification strongly improves inductive performance in 5/6 of our datasets, with up to a 120% improvement in Hits@50 - all with comparable speed to other non-contrastive baselines, and up to $14\\times$ faster than the best-performing contrastive baseline. Our work imparts interesting findings about non-contrastive learning for link prediction and paves the way for future researchers to further expand upon this area",

Under this trust model, previous work largely focus on achieving privacy using a shuffle protocol, where a batch of users data are randomly permuted before sending to a central server. This protocol achieves ($\\epsilon,\\delta$) or approximate-DP guarantee by sacrificing an additive $O\\!\\left(\\!\\frac{K\\log T\\sqrt{\\log(1/\\delta)}}{\\epsilon}\\!\\right)\\!$ factor in $T$-step cumulative regret. In contrast, the optimal privacy cost to achieve a stronger ($\\epsilon,0$) or pure-DP guarantee under the widely used central trust model is only $\\Theta\\!\\left(\\!\\frac{K\\log T}{\\epsilon}\\!\\right)\\!$, where, however, a trusted server is required. In this work, we aim to obtain a pure-DP guarantee under distributed trust model while sacrificing no more regret than that under central trust model. We achieve this by designing a generic bandit algorithm based on successive arm elimination, where privacy is guaranteed by corrupting rewards with an equivalent discrete Laplace noise ensured by a secure computation protocol. We also show that our algorithm, when instantiated with Skellam noise and the secure protocol, ensures \\emph{R\\'{e}nyi differential privacy} -- a stronger notion than approximate DP -- under distributed trust model with a privacy cost of $O\\!\\left(\\!\\frac{K\\sqrt{\\log T}}{\\epsilon}\\!\\right)\\!$. Finally, as a by-product of our techniques, we also recover the best-known regret bounds for bandits under central and local models while using only \\emph{discrete privacy noise}, which can avoid the privacy leakage due to floating point arithmetic of continuous noise on finite computers",

    "title": "Provably Auditing Ordinary Least Squares in Low Dimensions",
    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "Auditing the stability of a machine learning model to small changes in the training procedure is critical for engendering trust in practical applications. For example, a model should not be overly sensitive to removing a small fraction of its training data. However, algorithmically validating this property seems computationally challenging, even for the simplest of models: Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) linear regression. Concretely, recent work defines the stability of a regression as the minimum number of samples that need to be removed so that rerunning the analysis overturns the conclusion (Broderick et al., 2020), specifically meaning that the sign of a particular coefficient of the OLS regressor changes. But the only known approach for estimating this metric, besides the obvious exponential-time algorithm, is a greedy heuristic that may produce severe overestimates and therefore cannot certify stability. We show that stability can be efficiently certified in the low-dimensional regime: when the number of covariates is a constant but the number of samples is large, there are polynomial-time algorithms for estimating (a fractional version of) stability, with provable approximation guarantees. Applying our algorithms to the Boston Housing dataset, we exhibit regression analyses where our estimator outperforms the greedy heuristic, and can successfully certify stability even in the regime where a constant fraction of the samples are dropped",

Due to its NP-hard nature, heuristic algorithms were traditionally used to acquire reasonably good solutions, and more recent works have proposed Machine Learning (ML) heuristics that can generalize to unseen graphs and outperform the non-ML heuristics. However, it is computationally costly to generate solutions using existing ML schedulers since they adopt the episodic reinforcement learning framework that necessitates multi-round neural network processing. We propose a novel ML scheduler that uses a one-shot neural network encoder to sample node priorities which are converted by list scheduling to the final schedules. Since the one-shot encoder can efficiently sample the priorities in parallel, our algorithm runs significantly faster than existing ML baselines and has comparable run time with the fast traditional heuristics. We empirically show that our algorithm generates better schedules than both non-neural and neural baselines across various real-world and synthetic scheduling tasks",

Meanwhile, graph neural networks (GNNs) emerged recently as a promising class of models for graph-structured data in semi-supervised learning and beyond. Their competitive performance is often attributed to a proper capturing of the graph inductive bias. In this work, we introduce this inductive bias into GPs to improve their predictive performance for graph-structured data. We show that a prominent example of GNNs, the graph convolutional network, is equivalent to some GP when its layers are infinitely wide; and we analyze the kernel universality and the limiting behavior in depth. We further present a programmable procedure to compose covariance kernels inspired by this equivalence and derive example kernels corresponding to several interesting members of the GNN family. We also propose a computationally efficient approximation of the covariance matrix for scalable posterior inference with large-scale data. We demonstrate that these graph-based kernels lead to competitive classification and regression performance, as well as advantages in computation time, compared with the respective GNNs",

We consider finite-sum federated optimization under a second-order function similarity condition and strong convexity, and propose two new algorithms: SVRP and Catalyzed SVRP. This second-order similarity condition has grown popular recently, and is satisfied in many applications including distributed statistical learning and differentially private empirical risk minimization. The first algorithm, SVRP, combines approximate stochastic proximal point evaluations, client sampling, and variance reduction. We show that SVRP is communication efficient and achieves superior performance to many existing algorithms when function similarity is high enough. Our second algorithm, Catalyzed SVRP, is a Catalyst-accelerated variant of SVRP that achieves even better performance and uniformly improves upon existing algorithms for federated optimization under second-order similarity and strong convexity. In the course of analyzing these algorithms, we provide a new analysis of the Stochastic Proximal Point Method (SPPM) that might be of independent interest. Our analysis of SPPM is simple, allows for approximate proximal point evaluations, does not require any smoothness assumptions, and shows a clear benefit in communication complexity over ordinary distributed stochastic gradient descent",

We propose a novel Mutual Learning based PLL approach named ML-PLL to address this challenging problem. ML-PLL learns a prediction network based classifier and a class-prototype based classifier cooperatively through interactive mutual learning and label correction. Moreover, we use a transformation network to model the association relationships between the true label and candidate labels, and learn it together with the prediction network to match the observed candidate labels in the training data and enhance label correction.

In this paper, we formalize this learning scenario as a new problem called partial label unsupervised domain adaptation (PLUDA). To address this challenging PLUDA problem, we propose a novel Prototype Alignment based PLUDA method named PAPLUDA, which dynamically refines the pseudo-labels of instances from both the source and target domains by consulting the outputs of a teacher-student model in a moving-average manner, and bridges the cross-domain discrepancy through inter-domain class-prototype alignment. In addition, a teacher-student model based contrastive regularization is deployed to enhance prediction stability and hence improve the class-prototypes in both domains for PLUDA.

Recently, many works present lots of special methods for applying deep neural networks to KT from different perspectives like model architecture, adversarial augmentation and etc., which make the overall algorithm and system become more and more complex. Furthermore, due to the lack of standardized evaluation protocol \\citep{liu2022pykt}, there is no widely agreed KT baselines and published experimental comparisons become inconsistent and self-contradictory, i.e., the reported AUC scores of DKT on ASSISTments2009 range from 0.721 to 0.821 \\citep{minn2018deep,yeung2018addressing}. Therefore, in this paper, we provide a strong but simple baseline method to deal with the KT task named \\textsc{simpleKT}. Inspired by the Rasch model in psychometrics, we explicitly model question-specific variations to capture the individual differences among questions covering the same set of knowledge components that are a generalization of terms of concepts or skills needed for learners to accomplish steps in a task or a problem. Furthermore, instead of using sophisticated representations to capture student forgetting behaviors, we use the ordinary dot-product attention function to extract the time-aware information embedded in the student learning interactions. Extensive experiments show that such a simple baseline is able to always rank top 3 in terms of AUC scores and achieve 57 wins, 3 ties and 16 loss against 12 DLKT baseline methods on 7 public datasets of different domains. We believe this work serves as a strong baseline for future KT research.

We refrain from ensembling the representation backbone; this choice yields an efficient ensemble method that incurs a small training cost and requires no architectural changes or computational overhead to downstream evaluation. The effectiveness of our method is demonstrated with two state-of-the-art SSL methods, DINO (Caron et al., 2021) and MSN (Assran et al., 2022). Our method outperforms both in multiple evaluation metrics on ImageNet-1K, particularly in the few-shot setting. We explore several weighting schemes and find that those which increase the diversity of ensemble heads lead to better downstream evaluation results.

We find that when the pre-training data meets certain criteria---it is sufficiently large and contains descriptive captions with low variability----image-only methods do not match CLIP's performance even when they are trained with more image data.

Thus, we present a parameter-efficient fine-tuning design paradigm and discover design patterns that are applicable to different experimental settings. Instead of focusing on designing another individual tuning strategy, we introduce parameter-efficient fine-tuning design spaces that parameterize tuning structures and tuning strategies. Specifically, any design space is characterized by four components: layer grouping, trainable parameter allocation, tunable groups, and strategy assignment. Our comprehensive empirical study leads to the discovery of design patterns: (i) grouping layers in a spindle pattern, (ii) uniformly allocating the number of trainable parameters to layers, (ii) tuning all the groups, and (iv) tuning different groups with proper strategies.

In this work we proposed Concept Gradient (CG), which extends concept-based, gradient interpretation methods to non-linear concept functions. We showed that for a general (potentially non-linear) concept, we can mathematically measure how a small change of concept affects the model's prediction, which is an extension of gradient-based interpretation to the concept space.

    "abstract": "A well-known failure mode of neural networks is that they may confidently return erroneous predictions. Such unsafe behaviour is particularly frequent when the use case slightly differs from the training context, and/or in the presence of an adversary. This work presents a novel direction to address these issues in a broad, general manner: imposing class-aware constraints on a model's internal activation patterns. Specifically, we assign to each class a unique, fixed, randomly-generated binary vector - hereafter called class code - and train the model so that its cross-depths activation patterns predict the appropriate class code according to the input sample's class. The resulting predictors are dubbed total activation classifiers (TAC), and TACs may either be trained from scratch, or used with negligible cost as a thin add-on on top of a frozen, pre-trained neural network. The distance between a TAC's activation pattern and the closest valid code acts as an additional confidence score, besides the default unTAC'ed prediction head's. In the add-on case, the original neural network's inference head is completely unaffected (so its accuracy remains the same) but we now have the option to use TAC's own confidence and prediction when determining which course of action to take in an hypothetical production workflow. In particular, we show that TAC strictly improves the value derived from models allowed to reject/defer. We provide further empirical evidence that TAC works well on multiple types of architectures and data modalities and that it is at least as good as state-of-the-art alternative confidence scores derived from existing models",

In this paper, we present a new optimization-based method for sampling called mollified interaction energy descent (MIED). MIED minimizes a new class of energies on probability measures called mollified interaction energies (MIEs). These energies rely on mollifier functions---smooth approximations of the Dirac delta originated from PDE theory. We show that as the mollifier approaches the Dirac delta, the MIE converges to the chi-square divergence with respect to the target measure and the gradient flow of the MIE agrees with that of the chi-square divergence. Optimizing this energy with proper discretization yields a practical first-order particle-based algorithm for sampling in both unconstrained and constrained domains. We show experimentally that for unconstrained sampling problems our algorithm performs on par with existing particle-based algorithms like SVGD, while for constrained sampling problems our method readily incorporates constrained optimization techniques to handle more flexible constraints with strong performance compared to alternatives",

    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "Traditional analyses of gradient descent show that when the largest eigenvalue of the Hessian, also known as the sharpness $S(\\theta)$, is bounded by $2/\\eta$, training is \"stable\" and the training loss decreases monotonically. Recent works, however, have observed that this assumption does not hold when training modern neural networks with full batch or large batch gradient descent. Most recently, Cohen at al. (2021) detailed two important phenomena. The first, dubbed \\emph{progressive sharpening}, is that the sharpness steadily increases throughout training until it reaches the instability cutoff $2/\\eta$. The second, dubbed \\emph{edge of stability}, is that the sharpness hovers at $2/\\eta$ for the remainder of training while the loss continues decreasing, albeit non-monotonically. We demonstrate that, far from being chaotic, the dynamics of gradient descent at the edge of stability can be captured by a cubic Taylor expansion: as the iterates diverge in direction of the top eigenvector of the Hessian due to instability, the cubic term in the local Taylor expansion of the loss function causes the curvature to decrease until stability is restored. This property, which we call \\emph{self-stabilization}, is a general property of gradient descent and explains its behavior at the edge of stability. A key consequence of self-stabilization is that gradient descent at the edge of stability implicitly follows \\emph{projected} gradient descent (PGD) under the constraint $S(\\theta) \\le 2/\\eta$. Our analysis provides precise predictions for the loss, sharpness, and deviation from the PGD trajectory throughout training, which we verify both empirically in a number of standard settings and theoretically under mild conditions.

    "title": "TILP: Differentiable Learning of Temporal Logical Rules on Knowledge Graphs",
    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "Compared with static knowledge graphs, temporal knowledge graphs (tKG), which can capture the evolution and change of information over time, are more realistic and general. However, due to the complexity that the notion of time introduces to the learning of the rules, an accurate graph reasoning, e.g., predicting new links between entities, is still a difficult problem. In this paper, we propose TILP, a differentiable framework for temporal logical rules learning. By designing a constrained random walk mechanism and the introduction of temporal operators, we ensure the efficiency of our model. We present temporal features modeling in tKG, e.g., recurrence, temporal order, interval between pair of relations, and duration, and incorporate it into our learning process. We compare TILP with state-of-the-art methods on two benchmark datasets. We show that our proposed framework can improve upon the performance of baseline methods while providing interpretable results. In particular, we consider various scenarios in which training samples are limited, data is biased, and the time range between training and inference are different. In all these cases, TILP works much better than the state-of-the-art methods",

    "title": "Revisiting the Assumption of Latent Separability for Backdoor Defenses",
    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "Recent studies revealed that deep learning is susceptible to backdoor poisoning attacks. An adversary can embed a hidden backdoor into a model to manipulate its predictions by only modifying a few training data, without controlling the training process. Currently, a tangible signature has been widely observed across a diverse set of backdoor poisoning attacks --- models trained on a poisoned dataset tend to learn separable latent representations for poison and clean samples. This latent separation is so pervasive that a family of backdoor defenses directly take it as a default assumption (dubbed latent separability assumption), based on which to identify poison samples via cluster analysis in the latent space. An intriguing question consequently follows: is the latent separation unavoidable for backdoor poisoning attacks? This question is central to understanding whether the assumption of latent separability provides a reliable foundation for defending against backdoor poisoning attacks. In this paper, we design adaptive backdoor poisoning attacks to present counter-examples against this assumption. Our methods include two key components: (1) a set of trigger-planted samples correctly labeled to their semantic classes (other than the target class) that can regularize backdoor learning; (2) asymmetric trigger planting strategies that help to boost attack success rate (ASR) as well as to diversify latent representations of poison samples. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets verify the effectiveness of our adaptive attacks in bypassing existing latent separation based backdoor defenses. Moreover, our attacks still maintain a high attack success rate with negligible clean accuracy drop. Our studies call for defense designers to take caution when leveraging latent separation as an assumption in their defenses.

While there exist influential results on the problem from the ``near initialization'' perspective, we shed considerable new light on the problem. In particular, we make two key technical contributions for such models with $L$ layers, $m$ width, and $\\sigma_0^2$ initialization variance. First, for suitable $\\sigma_0^2$, we establish a $O(\\frac{\\text{poly}(L)}{\\sqrt{m}})$ upper bound on the spectral norm of the Hessian of such models, considerably sharpening prior results. Second, we introduce a new analysis of optimization based on Restricted Strong Convexity (RSC) which holds as long as the squared norm of the average gradient of predictors is $\\Omega(\\frac{\\text{poly}(L)}{\\sqrt{m}})$ for the square loss. We also present results for more general losses. The RSC based analysis does not need the ``near initialization\" perspective and guarantees geometric convergence for gradient descent (GD). To the best of our knowledge, ours is the first result on establishing geometric convergence of GD based on RSC for deep learning models, thus becoming an alternative sufficient condition for convergence that does not depend on the widely-used Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK).

KNF imposes appropriate inductive biases for improved robustness against distributional shifts, employing both a global operator to learn shared characteristics and a local operator to capture changing dynamics, as well as a specially-designed feedback loop to continuously update the learnt operators over time for rapidly varying behaviors.

    "abstract": "Given a graph learning task, such as link prediction, on a new graph, how can we select the best method as well as its hyperparameters (collectively called a model) without having to train or evaluate any model on the new graph? Model selection for graph learning has been largely ad hoc. A typical approach has been to apply popular methods to new datasets, but this is often suboptimal. On the other hand, systematically comparing models on the new graph quickly becomes too costly, or even impractical. In this work, we develop the first meta-learning approach for evaluation-free graph learning model selection, called MetaGL, which utilizes the prior performances of existing methods on various benchmark graph datasets to automatically select an effective model for the new graph, without any model training or evaluations. To quantify similarities across a wide variety of graphs, we introduce specialized meta-graph features that capture the structural characteristics of a graph. Then we design G-M network, which represents the relations among graphs and models, and develop a graph-based meta-learner operating on this G-M network, which estimates the relevance of each model to different graphs. Extensive experiments show that using MetaGL to select a model for the new graph greatly outperforms several existing meta-learning techniques tailed for graph learning model selection (up to 47% better), while being extremely fast at test time (∼1 sec)",

To mitigate device heterogeneity, a common approach is to use masking. In this paper, we first show that using random masking can lead to a bias in the obtained solution of the learning model. To this end, we propose a personalized FL algorithm with optimized masking vectors called PerFedMask. In particular, PerFedMask facilitates each device to obtain its optimized masking vector based on its computational capability before training. Fine-tuning is performed after training. PerFedMask is a generalization of a recently proposed personalized FL algorithm, FedBABU (Oh et al., 2022). PerFedMask can be combined with other FL algorithms including HeteroFL (Diao et al., 2021) and Split-Mix FL (Hong et al., 2022). Results based on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets show that the proposed PerFedMask algorithm provides a higher test accuracy after fine-tuning and lower average number of trainable parameters when compared with six existing state-of-the-art FL algorithms in the literature.

    "title": "Variational Latent Branching Model for Off-Policy Evaluation",

    "abstract": "Model-based methods have recently shown great potential for off-policy evaluation (OPE); offline trajectories induced by behavioral policies are fitted to transitions of Markov decision processes (MDPs), which are used to rollout simulated trajectories and estimate the performance of policies. Model-based OPE methods face two key challenges. First, as offline trajectories are usually fixed, they tend to cover limited state and action space. Second, the performance of model-based methods can be sensitive to the initialization of their parameters. In this work, we propose the variational latent branching model (VLBM) to learn the transition function of MDPs by formulating the environmental dynamics as a compact latent space, from which the next states and rewards are then sampled. Specifically, VLBM leverages and extends the variational inference framework with the recurrent state alignment (RSA), which is designed to capture as much information underlying the limited training data, by smoothing out the information flow between the variational (encoding) and generative (decoding) part of VLBM. Moreover, we also introduce the branching architecture to improve the model's robustness against randomly initialized model weights. The effectiveness of the VLBM is evaluated on the deep OPE (DOPE) benchmark, from which the training trajectories are designed to result in varied coverage of the state-action space. We show that the VLBM outperforms existing state-of-the-art OPE methods in general",

Since most training data sets are not drawn from such distributions, we use the NTK model and a data-dependent quadrature rule to theoretically quantify the frequency biasing of NN training given fully nonuniform data.

    "abstract": "The ability to jointly learn from multiple modalities, such as text, audio, and visual data, is a defining feature of intelligent systems. While there have been promising advances in designing neural networks to harness multimodal data, the enormous success of data augmentation currently remains limited to single-modality tasks like image classification. Indeed, it is particularly difficult to augment each modality while preserving the overall semantic structure of the data; for example, a caption may no longer be a good description of an image after standard augmentations have been applied, such as translation. Moreover, it is challenging to specify reasonable transformations that are not tailored to a particular modality. In this paper, we introduce LeMDA, Learning Multimodal Data Augmentation, an easy-to-use method that automatically learns to jointly augment multimodal data in feature space, with no constraints on the identities of the modalities or the relationship between modalities. We show that LeMDA can (1) profoundly improve the performance of multimodal deep learning architectures, (2) apply to combinations of modalities that have not been previously considered, and (3) achieve state-of-the-art results on a wide range of applications comprised of image, text, and tabular data",

When provided with parametric knowledge about the unknown reward function, such a policy may outperform the expert's.

In theory (assuming bounded range and precision), this limits their formal language recognition power to regular languages, and in practice, RNNs have been shown to be unable to learn many context-free languages (CFLs). In order to expand the class of languages RNNs recognize, prior work has augmented RNNs with a nondeterministic stack data structure, putting them on par with pushdown automata and increasing their language recognition power to CFLs. Nondeterminism is needed for recognizing all CFLs (not just deterministic CFLs), but in this paper, we show that nondeterminism and the neural controller interact to produce two more unexpected abilities. First, the nondeterministic stack RNN can recognize not only CFLs, but also many non-context-free languages. Second, it can recognize languages with much larger alphabet sizes than one might expect given the size of its stack alphabet. Finally, to increase the information capacity in the stack and allow it to solve more complicated tasks with large alphabet sizes, we propose a new version of the nondeterministic stack that simulates stacks of vectors rather than discrete symbols.

The existing dataset coverage assumption in offline general-sum games inevitably incurs a dependency on the number of actions, which can be exponentially large in congestion games. We consider three different types of feedback with decreasing revealed information. Starting from the facility-level (a.k.a., semi-bandit) feedback, we propose a novel one-unit deviation coverage condition and show a pessimism-type algorithm that can recover an approximate NE. For the agent-level (a.k.a., bandit) feedback setting, interestingly, we show the one-unit deviation coverage condition is not sufficient. On the other hand, we convert the game to multi-agent linear bandits and show that with a generalized data coverage assumption in offline linear bandits, we can efficiently recover the approximate NE. Lastly, we consider a novel type of feedback, the game-level feedback where only the total reward from all agents is revealed. Again, we show the coverage assumption for the agent-level feedback setting is insufficient in the game-level feedback setting, and with a stronger version of the data coverage assumption for linear bandits, we can recover an approximate NE. Together, our results constitute the first study of offline congestion games and imply formal separations between different types of feedback",

    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "The success of machine learning relies heavily on massive amounts of data, which are usually generated and stored across a range of diverse and distributed data sources. Decentralized learning has thus been advocated and widely deployed to make efficient use of distributed datasets, with an extensive focus on supervised learning (SL) problems. Unfortunately, the majority of real-world data are unlabeled and can be highly heterogeneous across sources. In this work, we carefully study decentralized learning with unlabeled data through the lens of self-supervised learning (SSL), specifically contrastive visual representation learning. We study the effectiveness of a range of contrastive learning algorithms under a decentralized learning setting, on relatively large-scale datasets including ImageNet-100, MS-COCO, and a new real-world robotic warehouse dataset. Our experiments show that the decentralized SSL (Dec-SSL) approach is robust to the heterogeneity of decentralized datasets, and learns useful representation for object classification, detection, and segmentation tasks, even when combined with the simple and standard decentralized learning algorithm of Federated Averaging (FedAvg). This robustness makes it possible to significantly reduce communication and to reduce the participation ratio of data sources with only minimal drops in performance. Interestingly, using the same amount of data, the representation learned by Dec-SSL can not only perform on par with that learned by centralized SSL which requires communication and excessive data storage costs, but also sometimes outperform representations extracted from decentralized SL which requires extra knowledge about the data labels. Finally, we provide theoretical insights into understanding why data heterogeneity is less of a concern for Dec-SSL objectives, and introduce feature alignment and clustering techniques to develop a new Dec-SSL algorithm that further improves the performance, in the face of highly non-IID data. Our study presents positive evidence to embrace unlabeled data in decentralized learning, and we hope to provide new insights into whether and why decentralized SSL is effective and/or even advantageous",

However, multiple recent works empirically demonstrate that common invariance-inducing regularizers are ineffective in the over-parameterized regime, in which classifiers perfectly fit (i.e. interpolate) the training data. This suggests that the phenomenon of ``benign overfitting,\" in which models generalize well despite interpolating, might not favorably extend to settings in which robustness or fairness are desirable. In this work, we provide a theoretical justification for these observations. We prove that---even in the simplest of settings---any interpolating learning rule (with an arbitrarily small margin) will not satisfy these invariance properties. We then propose and analyze an algorithm that---in the same setting---successfully learns a non-interpolating classifier that is provably invariant. We validate our theoretical observations on simulated data and the Waterbirds dataset",

    "title": "Exploring and Exploiting Decision Boundary Dynamics for Adversarial Robustness",
    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "The robustness of a deep classifier can be characterized by its margins: the decision boundary's distances to natural data points. However, it is unclear whether existing robust training methods effectively increase the margin for each vulnerable point during training. To understand this, we propose a continuous-time framework for quantifying the relative speed of the decision boundary with respect to each individual point. Through visualizing the moving speed of the decision boundary under Adversarial Training, one of the most effective robust training algorithms, a surprising moving-behavior is revealed: the decision boundary moves away from some vulnerable points but simultaneously moves closer to others, decreasing their margins. To alleviate these conflicting dynamics of the decision boundary, we propose Dynamics-aware Robust Training (DyART), which encourages the decision boundary to engage in movement that prioritizes increasing smaller margins. In contrast to prior works, DyART directly operates on the margins rather than their indirect approximations, allowing for more targeted and effective robustness improvement. Experiments on the CIFAR-10 and Tiny-ImageNet datasets verify that DyART alleviates the conflicting dynamics of the decision boundary and obtains improved robustness under various perturbation sizes compared to the state-of-the-art defenses.

    "abstract": "Widely used evaluation metrics for text generation either do not work well with longer texts or fail to evaluate all aspects of text quality. In this paper, we introduce a new metric called SMART to mitigate such limitations. Specifically, we treat sentences as basic units of matching instead of tokens, and use a sentence matching function to soft-match candidate and reference sentences. Candidate sentences are also compared to sentences in the source documents to allow grounding (e.g., factuality) evaluation. Our results show that system-level correlations of our proposed metric with a model-based matching function outperforms all competing metrics on the SummEval summarization meta-evaluation dataset, while the same metric with a string-based matching function is competitive with current model-based metrics. The latter does not use any neural model, which is useful during model development phases where resources can be limited and fast evaluation is required. SMART also outperforms all factuality evaluation metrics on the TRUE benchmark. Finally, we also conducted extensive analyses showing that our proposed metrics work well with longer summaries and are less biased towards specific models",

In this paper, through causal modeling with a directed acyclic graph (DAG) on the decision-distribution interplay, we investigate the possibility of achieving long-term fairness from a dynamic perspective. We propose Tier Balancing, a technically more challenging but more natural notion to achieve in the context of long-term, dynamic fairness analysis. Different from previous fairness notions that are defined purely on observed variables, our notion goes one step further, capturing behind-the-scenes situation changes on the unobserved latent causal factors that directly carry out the influence from the current decision to the future data distribution. Under the specified dynamics, we prove that in general one cannot achieve the long-term fairness goal only through one-step interventions. Furthermore, in the effort of approaching long-term fairness, we consider the mission of \"getting closer to\" the long-term fairness goal and present possibility and impossibility results accordingly",

These models provide a continuous-time latent representation of the underlying dynamical system where new observations at arbitrary time points can be used to update the latent representation of the dynamical system. Existing parameterizations for the dynamics functions of Neural ODEs limit the ability of the model to retain global information about the time series; specifically, a piece-wise integration of the latent process between observations can result in a loss of memory on the dynamic patterns of previously observed data points. We propose PolyODE, a Neural ODE that models the latent continuous-time process as a projection onto a basis of orthogonal polynomials. This formulation enforces long-range memory and preserves a global representation of the underlying dynamical system.

    "abstract": "AutoML has demonstrated remarkable success in finding an effective neural architecture for a given machine learning task defined by a specific dataset and an evaluation metric. However, most present AutoML techniques consider each task independently from scratch, which requires exploring many architectures, leading to high computational cost. Here we propose AutoTransfer, an AutoML solution that improves search efficiency by transferring the prior architectural design knowledge to the novel task of interest. Our key innovation includes a task-model bank that captures the model performance over a diverse set of GNN architectures and tasks, and a computationally efficient task embedding that can accurately measure the similarity among different tasks. Based on the task-model bank and the task embeddings, we estimate the design priors of desirable models of the novel task, by aggregating a similarity-weighted sum of the top-K design distributions on tasks that are similar to the task of interest. The computed design priors can be used with any AutoML search algorithm. We evaluate AutoTransfer on six datasets in the graph machine learning domain. Experiments demonstrate that (i) our proposed task embedding can be computed efficiently, and that tasks with similar embeddings have similar best-performing architectures; (ii) AutoTransfer significantly improves search efficiency with the transferred design priors, reducing the number of explored architectures by an order of magnitude. Finally, we release GNN-Bank-101, a large-scale dataset of detailed GNN training information of 120,000 task-model combinations to facilitate and inspire future research",

    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "Node classification is a classical graph representation learning task on which Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have recently achieved strong results. However, it is often believed that standard GNNs only work well for homophilous graphs, i.e., graphs where edges tend to connect nodes of the same class. Graphs without this property are called heterophilous, and it is typically assumed that specialized methods are required to achieve strong performance on such graphs. In this work, we challenge this assumption. First, we show that the standard datasets used for evaluating heterophily-specific models have serious drawbacks, making results obtained by using them unreliable. The most significant of these drawbacks is the presence of a large number of duplicate nodes in the datasets Squirrel and Chameleon, which leads to train-test data leakage. We show that removing duplicate nodes strongly affects GNN performance on these datasets. Then, we propose a set of heterophilous graphs of varying properties that we believe can serve as a better benchmark for evaluating the performance of GNNs under heterophily. We show that standard GNNs achieve strong results on these heterophilous graphs, almost always outperforming specialized models.

However, their generated sequences often exhibit degenerate properties such as non-termination, undesirable repetition, and premature termination, when generated with decoding algorithms such as greedy search, beam search, top-$k$ sampling, and nucleus sampling. In this paper, we focus on the problem of non-terminating sequences resulting from an incomplete decoding algorithm. We first define an incomplete probable decoding algorithm which includes greedy search, top-$k$ sampling, and nucleus sampling, beyond the incomplete decoding algorithm originally put forward by Welleck et al. (2020). We then propose a non-monotonic self-terminating language model, which significantly relaxes the constraint of monotonically increasing termination probability in the originally proposed self-terminating language model by Welleck et al. (2020), to address the issue of non-terminating sequences when using incomplete probable decoding algorithms. We prove that our proposed model prevents non-terminating sequences when using not only incomplete probable decoding algorithms but also beam search.

In memorization, models overfit specific training examples and become susceptible to privacy attacks. In forgetting, examples which appeared early in training are forgotten by the end. In this work, we connect these phenomena. We propose a technique to measure to what extent models ``forget'' the specifics of training examples, becoming less susceptible to privacy attacks on examples they have not seen recently. We show that, while non-convexity can prevent forgetting from happening in the worst-case, standard image,speech, and language models empirically do forget examples over time. We identify nondeterminism as a potential explanation, showing that deterministically trained models do not forget. Our results suggest that examples seen early when training with extremely large datasets---for instance those examples used to pre-train a model---may observe privacy benefits at the expense of examples seen later",

This work shows that we can create good video prediction models by pre-training transformers via masked visual modeling. Our approach, named MaskViT, is based on two simple design decisions. First, for memory and training efficiency, we use two types of window attention: spatial and spatiotemporal. Second, during training, we mask a variable percentage of tokens instead of a fixed mask ratio. For inference, MaskViT generates all tokens via iterative refinement where we incrementally decrease the masking ratio following a mask scheduling function. On several datasets we demonstrate that MaskViT outperforms prior works in video prediction, is parameter efficient, and can generate high resolution videos ($256 \\times $256). Further, we demonstrate the benefits of inference speedup (up to $512 \\times$) due to iterative decoding by using MaskViT for planning on a real robot. Our work suggests that we can endow embodied agents with powerful predictive models by leveraging the general framework of masked visual modeling with minimal domain knowledge",

Specifically, we introduce a method for accurately answering yes-no questions given only unlabeled model activations. It works by finding a direction in activation space that satisfies logical consistency properties, such as that a statement and its negation have opposite truth values. We show that despite using no supervision and no model outputs, our method can recover diverse knowledge represented in large language models: across 6 models and 10 question-answering datasets, it outperforms zero-shot accuracy by 4\\% on average. We also find that it cuts prompt sensitivity in half and continues to maintain high accuracy even when models are prompted to generate incorrect answers.

    "abstract": "Steganography is the practice of encoding secret information into innocuous content in such a manner that an adversarial third party would not realize that there is hidden meaning. While this problem has classically been studied in security literature, recent advances in generative models have led to a shared interest among security and machine learning researchers in developing scalable steganography techniques. In this work, we show that a steganography procedure is perfectly secure under Cachin (1998)'s information theoretic-model of steganography if and only if it is induced by a coupling. Furthermore, we show that, among perfectly secure procedures, a procedure is maximally efficient if and only if it is induced by a minimum entropy coupling. These insights yield what are, to the best of our knowledge, the first steganography algorithms to achieve perfect security guarantees with non-trivial efficiency; additionally, these algorithms are highly scalable. To provide empirical validation, we compare a minimum entropy coupling-based approach to three modern baselines---arithmetic coding, Meteor, and adaptive dynamic grouping---using GPT-2, WaveRNN, and Image Transformer as communication channels. We find that the minimum entropy coupling-based approach achieves superior encoding efficiency, despite its stronger security constraints. In aggregate, these results suggest that it may be natural to view information-theoretic steganography through the lens of minimum entropy coupling",

    "abstract": "Sequential data naturally have different lengths in many domains, with some very long sequences. As an important modeling tool, neural attention should capture long-range interaction in such sequences. However, most existing neural attention models admit only short sequences, or they have to employ chunking or padding to enforce a constant input length. Here we propose a simple neural network building block called ChordMixer which can model the attention for long sequences with variable lengths. Each ChordMixer block consists of a position-wise rotation layer without learnable parameters and an element-wise MLP layer. Repeatedly applying such blocks forms an effective network backbone that mixes the input signals towards the learning targets. We have tested ChordMixer on the synthetic adding problem, long document classification, and DNA sequence-based taxonomy classification. The experiment results show that our method substantially outperforms other neural attention models",

    "abstract": "The execution behavior of a program often depends on external resources, such as program inputs or file contents, and so the program cannot be run in isolation. Nevertheless, software developers benefit from fast iteration loops where automated tools identify errors as early as possible, even before programs can be compiled and run. This presents an interesting machine learning challenge: can we predict runtime errors in a \"static\" setting, where program execution is not possible? Here, we introduce a competitive programming dataset and task for predicting runtime errors, which we show is difficult for generic models like Transformers. We approach this task by developing an interpreter-inspired architecture with an inductive bias towards mimicking program executions, which models exception handling and \"learns to execute\" descriptions of external resources. Surprisingly, we show that the model can also predict the locations of errors, despite being trained only on labels indicating error presence or absence and kind. In total, we present a practical and difficult-yet-approachable challenge problem related to learning program execution behavior and we demonstrate promising new capabilities of interpreter-inspired machine learning models for code",

    "abstract": "Odor perception in mammals is triggered by interactions between volatile organic compounds and a subset of hundreds of proteins called olfactory receptors (ORs). Molecules activate these receptors in a complex combinatorial coding allowing mammals to discriminate a vast number of chemical stimuli. Recently, ORs have gained attention as new therapeutic targets following the discovery of their involvement in other physiological processes and diseases. To date, predicting molecule-induced activation for ORs is highly challenging since $43\\%$ of ORs have no identified active compound. In this work, we combine [CLS] token from protBERT with a molecular graph and propose a tailored GNN architecture incorporating inductive biases from the protein-molecule binding. We abstract the biological process of protein-molecule activation as the injection of a molecule into a protein-specific environment. On a newly gathered dataset of $46$ $700$ OR-molecule pairs, this model outperforms state-of-the-art models on drug-target interaction prediction as well as standard GNN baselines. Moreover, by incorporating non-bonded interactions the model is able to work with mixtures of compounds.

Most practical implementations of SGDA randomly reshuffle components and sequentially use them (i.e., without-replacement sampling); however, there are few theoretical results on this approach for minimax algorithms, especially outside the easier-to-analyze (strongly-)monotone setups. To narrow this gap, we study the convergence bounds of SGDA with random reshuffling (SGDA-RR) for smooth nonconvex-nonconcave objectives with Polyak-{\\L}ojasiewicz (P{\\L}) geometry. We analyze both simultaneous and alternating SGDA-RR for nonconvex-P{\\L} and primal-P{\\L}-P{\\L} objectives, and obtain convergence rates faster than with-replacement SGDA. Our rates extend to mini-batch SGDA-RR, recovering known rates for full-batch gradient descent-ascent (GDA).

    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "This paper presents MOAT, a family of neural networks that build on top of MObile convolution (i.e., inverted residual blocks) and ATtention. Unlike the current works that stack separate mobile convolution and transformer blocks, we effectively merge them into a MOAT block. Starting with a standard Transformer block, we replace its multi-layer perceptron with a mobile convolution block, and further reorder it before the self-attention operation. The mobile convolution block not only enhances the network representation capacity, but also produces better downsampled features. Our conceptually simple MOAT networks are surprisingly effective, achieving 89.1% / 81.5% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K / ImageNet-1K-V2 with ImageNet-22K pretraining. Additionally, MOAT can be seamlessly applied to downstream tasks that require large resolution inputs by simply converting the global attention to window attention. Thanks to the mobile convolution that effectively exchanges local information between pixels (and thus cross-windows), MOAT does not need the extra window-shifting mechanism. As a result, on COCO object detection, MOAT achieves 59.2% AP$^{\\text{box}}$ with 227M model parameters (single-scale inference, and hard NMS), and on ADE20K semantic segmentation, MOAT attains 57.6% mIoU with 496M model parameters (single-scale inference). Finally, the tiny-MOAT family, obtained by simply reducing the channel sizes, also surprisingly outperforms several mobile-specific transformer-based models on ImageNet. The tiny-MOAT family is also benchmarked on downstream tasks, serving as a baseline for the community. We hope our simple yet effective MOAT will inspire more seamless integration of convolution and self-attention. Code is publicly available",

We believe that the richer form of annotation helps guide neural networks to learn more robust features without requiring more samples or larger models. Our model combines a part segmentation model with a tiny classifier and is trained end-to-end to simultaneously segment objects into parts and then classify the segmented object. Empirically, our part-based models achieve both higher accuracy and higher adversarial robustness than a ResNet-50 baseline on all three datasets. For instance, the clean accuracy of our part models is up to 15 percentage points higher than the baseline's, given the same level of robustness.

In this work, we develop a novel DG training strategy, we call PGrad, to learn a robust gradient direction, improving models' generalization ability on unseen domains. The proposed gradient aggregates the principal directions of a sampled roll-out optimization trajectory that measures the training dynamics across all training domains. PGrad gradient design forces the DG training to ignore domain-dependent noise signals and updates all training domains with a robust direction covering main components of parameter dynamics. We further improve PGrad via bijection-based computational refinement and directional plus length-based calibrations. Our theoretical proof connects PGrad to the spectral analysis of Hessian in training neural networks. Experiments on DomainBed and WILDS benchmarks demonstrate that our approach effectively enables robust DG optimization and leads to smoothly decreased loss curves.

    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "The separation between training and deployment of machine learning models implies that not all scenarios encountered in deployment can be anticipated during training, and therefore relying solely on advancements in training has its limits. Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is an important area that stress-tests a model's ability to handle unseen situations: Do models know when they don't know? Existing OOD detection methods either incur extra training steps, additional data or make nontrivial modifications to the trained network. In contrast, in this work, we propose an extremely simple, post-hoc, on-the-fly activation shaping method, ASH, where a large portion (e.g. 90%) of a sample's activation at a late layer is removed, and the rest (e.g. 10%) simplified or lightly adjusted. The shaping is applied at inference time, and does not require any statistics calculated from training data. Experiments show that such a simple treatment enhances in-distribution and out- of-distribution sample distinction so as to allow state-of-the-art OOD detection on ImageNet, and does not noticeably deteriorate the in-distribution accuracy.

One can apply multiple algorithms to produce $N$ potentially different clustersings of the same objects, that is, partitions of the $n$ objects into $K$ groups. Even a single randomized algorithm can output different clusterings. This often happens when one samples from the posterior of a Bayesian model, or runs multiple MCMC chains from random initializations. A natural task is then to form a consensus among these different clusterings. The challenge in an unsupervised setting is that the optimal matching between clusters of different inputs is unknown. We model this problem as finding a barycenter (also known as Fr\\'{e}chet mean) relative to the misclassification rate. We show that by lifting the problem to the space of association matrices, one can derive aggregation algorithms that circumvent the knowledge of the optimal matchings. We analyze the statistical performance of aggregation algorithms under a stochastic label perturbation model, and show that a $K$-means type algorithm followed by a local refinement step can achieve near optimal performance, with a rate that decays exponentially fast in $N$.

    "abstract": "The monotonic dependence of the outputs of a neural network on some of its inputs is a crucial inductive bias in many scenarios where domain knowledge dictates such behavior. This is especially important for interpretability and fairness considerations. In a broader context, scenarios in which monotonicity is important can be found in finance, medicine, physics, and other disciplines. It is thus desirable to build neural network architectures that implement this inductive bias provably. In this work, we propose a weight-constrained architecture with a single residual connection to achieve exact monotonic dependence in any subset of the inputs. The weight constraint scheme directly controls the Lipschitz constant of the neural network and thus provides the additional benefit of robustness. Compared to currently existing techniques used for monotonicity, our method is simpler in implementation and in theory foundations, has negligible computational overhead, is guaranteed to produce monotonic dependence, and is highly expressive. We show how the algorithm is used to train powerful, robust, and interpretable discriminators that achieve competitive performance compared to current state-of-the-art methods across various benchmarks, from social applications to the classification of the decays of subatomic particles produced at the CERN Large Hadron Collider",

This paper improves the robustness of image copy detection with active indexing, that optimizes the interplay of these two components. We reduce the quantization loss of a given image representation by making imperceptible changes to the image before its release. The loss is back-propagated through the deep neural network back to the image, under perceptual constraints. These modifications make the image more retrievable.

We understand a scene by decomposing the scene into different concepts (e.g., shape and position of an object) and learning the respective laws of these concepts, which may be either natural (e.g., laws of motion) or man-made (e.g., laws of a game). The automatic parsing of these laws indicates the model's ability to understand the scene, which makes law parsing play a central role in many visual tasks. This paper proposes a deep latent variable model for Compositional LAw Parsing (CLAP), which achieves the human-like compositionality ability through an encoding-decoding architecture to represent concepts in the scene as latent variables. CLAP employs concept-specific latent random functions instantiated with Neural Processes to capture the law of concepts. Our experimental results demonstrate that CLAP outperforms the baseline methods in multiple visual tasks such as intuitive physics, abstract visual reasoning, and scene representation. The law manipulation experiments illustrate CLAP's interpretability by modifying specific latent random functions on samples.

In particular, when attributes with a strong correlation with the target attribute are present, the trained model can provide unintended prejudgments and show significant inference errors (i.e., the dataset bias problem). Various methods have been proposed to mitigate dataset bias, and their emphasis is on weakly correlated samples, called bias-conflicting samples. These methods are based on explicit bias labels provided by humans. However, such methods require human costs. Recently, several studies have sought to reduce human intervention by utilizing the output space values of neural networks, such as feature space, logits, loss, or accuracy. However, these output space values may be insufficient for the model to understand the bias attributes well. In this study, we propose a debiasing algorithm leveraging gradient called Per-sample Gradient-based Debiasing (PGD). PGD is comprised of three steps: (1) training a model on uniform batch sampling, (2) setting the importance of each sample in proportion to the norm of the sample gradient, and (3) training the model using importance-batch sampling, whose probability is obtained in step (2).

We focus on analyzing Simple Graph Convolutions (SGC) and their generalized PageRank (GPR) extensions, thereby laying the theoretical foundations for unlearning GNNs. Empirical evaluations of six benchmark datasets demonstrate excellent performance/complexity/privacy trade-offs of our approach compared to complete retraining and general methods that do not leverage graph information. For example, unlearning $200$ out of $1208$ training nodes of the Cora dataset only leads to a $0.1\\%$ loss in test accuracy, but offers a $4$-fold speed-up compared to complete retraining with a $(\\epsilon,\\delta)=(1,10^{-4})$ ``privacy cost''. We also exhibit a $12\\%$ increase in test accuracy for the same dataset when compared to unlearning methods that do not leverage graph information, with comparable time complexity and the same privacy guarantee",

    "abstract": "In this work, we tackle the problem of generating audio samples conditioned on descriptive text captions. We propose AudioGen, an auto-regressive generative model, operating on a learnt discrete audio representation, that generates audio samples conditioned on text inputs. The task of text-to-audio generation poses multiple challenges. Due to the way audio travels through a medium, differentiating ``objects'' can be a difficult task (e.g., separating multiple people simultaneously speaking). This is further complicated by real-world recording conditions (e.g., background noise, reverberation, etc.). Scarce text annotations impose another constraint, limiting the ability to scale models. Finally, modeling high fidelity audio requires one to operate over extremely long sequences. To alleviate the aforementioned challenges we propose an augmentation technique that mixes different audio samples, driving the model to internally learn to separate multiple sources. We curated 10 datasets containing different types of audio and text annotations to handle the scarcity of text-audio data points. For faster inference, we explore the use of multi-stream modeling, allowing the use of shorter sequences while maintaining a similar bitrate and perceptual quality. Finally, we apply classifier-free guidance to improve adherence to text. Comparing to the evaluated baselines, AudioGen outperforms over both objective and subjective metrics. We further conduct an ablation study to gauge the effects of pre-trained text and audio components",

    "abstract": "Rapidly learning from ongoing experiences and remembering past events with a flexible memory system are two core capacities of biological intelligence. While the underlying neural mechanisms are not fully understood, various evidence supports that synaptic plasticity plays a critical role in memory formation and fast learning. Inspired by these results, we equip Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) with plasticity rules to enable them to adapt their parameters according to ongoing experiences. In addition to the traditional local Hebbian plasticity, we propose a global, gradient-based plasticity rule, which allows the model to evolve towards its self-determined target. Our models show promising results on sequential and associative memory tasks, illustrating their ability to robustly form and retain memories. In the meantime, these models can cope with many challenging few-shot learning problems. Comparing different plasticity rules under the same framework shows that Hebbian plasticity is well-suited for several memory and associative learning tasks; however, it is outperformed by gradient-based plasticity on few-shot regression tasks which require the model to infer the underlying mapping",

In this setting, an agent first interacts with the environment without accessing the reward function in the exploration phase. In the subsequent planning phase, it is given a reward function and asked to output an $\\epsilon$-optimal policy. We propose a novel algorithm LSVI-RFE under the linear MDP setting, where the transition probability and reward functions are linear in a feature mapping. We prove an $\\widetilde{O}(H^{4} d^{2}/\\epsilon^2)$ sample complexity upper bound for LSVI-RFE, where $H$ is the episode length and $d$ is the feature dimension. We also establish a sample complexity lower bound of $\\Omega(H^{3} d^{2}/\\epsilon^2)$. To the best of our knowledge, LSVI-RFE is the first computationally efficient algorithm that achieves the minimax optimal sample complexity in linear MDP settings up to an $H$ and logarithmic factors. Our LSVI-RFE algorithm is based on a novel variance-aware exploration mechanism to avoid overly-conservative exploration in prior works. Our sharp bound relies on the decoupling of UCB bonuses during two phases, and a Bernstein-type self-normalized bound, which remove the extra dependency of sample complexity on $H$ and $d$, respectively",

    "abstract": "Representation learning on semi-structured data, e.g., graphs, has become a central problem in deep learning community as relational structures are pervasive in real situations and induce data inter-dependence that hinders trivial adaptation of existing approaches in other domains where the inputs are assumed to be i.i.d. sampled. However, current models in this regime mostly focus on improving testing performance of in-distribution data and largely ignores the potential risk w.r.t. out-of-distribution (OOD) testing samples that may cause negative outcome if the model is overconfident in prediction on them. In this paper, we identify a provably effective OOD discriminator based on an energy function directly extracted from a graph neural network trained with standard supervised classification loss. This paves a way for a simple and efficient OOD detection model for GNN-based semi-supervised learning on graphs, which we call GNN-Safe. It also has nice theoretical properties that guarantee an overall distinguishable margin between the detection scores for in-distribution and OOD samples, which, more critically, can be further strengthened by a non-learning-based structured propagation scheme. Extensive experiments over five real-world datasets validate the practical efficacy of the proposed model for detecting various OOD instances that are inter-connected in a graph with up to 17.0% improvement on average AUROC over competitive peer models and without sacrificing in-distribution testing accuracy",

In particular, determining the optimal dose level plays a vital role in developing medical treatment regimes. One challenge in adapting existing RL algorithms to medical applications, however, is that the popular infinite support stochastic policies, e.g., Gaussian policy, may assign riskily high dosages and harm patients seriously. Hence, it is important to induce a policy class whose support only contains near-optimal actions, and shrink the action-searching area for effectiveness and reliability. To achieve this, we develop a novel quasi-optimal learning algorithm, which can be easily optimized in off-policy settings with guaranteed convergence under general function approximations. Theoretically, we analyze the consistency, sample complexity, adaptability, and convergence of the proposed algorithm.

In this two-level distribution framework, we characterize the generalization error not only for clients participating in the training but also for unparticipating clients.

    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "Transformers have quickly shined in the computer vision world since the emergence of Vision Transformers (ViTs). The dominant role of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) seems to be challenged by increasingly effective transformer-based models. Very recently, a couple of advanced convolutional models strike back with large kernels motivated by the local-window attention mechanism, showing appealing performance and efficiency. While one of them, i.e. RepLKNet, impressively manages to scale the kernel size to 31x31 with improved performance, the performance starts to saturate as the kernel size continues growing, compared to the scaling trend of advanced ViTs such as Swin Transformer. In this paper, we explore the possibility of training extreme convolutions larger than 31x31 and test whether the performance gap can be eliminated by strategically enlarging convolutions. This study ends up with a recipe for applying extremely large kernels from the perspective of sparsity, which can smoothly scale up kernels to 61x61 with better performance. Built on this recipe, we propose Sparse Large Kernel Network (SLaK), a pure CNN architecture equipped with sparse factorized 51x51 kernels that can perform on par with or better than state-of-the-art hierarchical Transformers and modern ConvNet architectures like ConvNeXt and RepLKNet, on ImageNet classification as well as a wide range of downstream tasks including semantic segmentation on ADE20K, object detection on PASCAL VOC 2007, and object detection/segmentation on MS COCO.

However, the complex interaction between layers also makes the learning process of a particular layer poorly understood.

We also uncover the fundamental reason behind this phenomenon: Flatter local minima of shallower layers make their gradients more stable and predictive, allowing for faster training. Another surprising result is that the shallower layers tend to learn the low-frequency components of the target function, while the deeper layers usually learn the high-frequency components.

    "abstract": "Oversmoothing is a central challenge of building more powerful Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). While previous works have only demonstrated that oversmoothing is inevitable when the number of graph convolutions tends to infinity, in this paper, we precisely characterize the mechanism behind the phenomenon via a non-asymptotic analysis. Specifically, we distinguish between two different effects when applying graph convolutions—an undesirable mixing effect that homogenizes node representations in different classes, and a desirable denoising effect that homogenizes node representations in the same class. By quantifying these two effects on random graphs sampled from the Contextual Stochastic Block Model (CSBM), we show that oversmoothing happens once the mixing effect starts to dominate the denoising effect, and the number of layers required for this transition is $O(\\log N/\\log (\\log N))$ for sufficiently dense graphs with $N$ nodes. We also extend our analysis to study the effects of Personalized PageRank (PPR), or equivalently, the effects of initial residual connections on oversmoothing. Our results suggest that while PPR mitigates oversmoothing at deeper layers, PPR-based architectures still achieve their best performance at a shallow depth and are outperformed by the graph convolution approach on certain graphs. Finally, we support our theoretical results with numerical experiments, which further suggest that the oversmoothing phenomenon observed in practice can be magnified by the difficulty of optimizing deep GNN models",

LTC neural networks are causal continuous-time neural networks with an input-dependent state transition module, which makes them learn to adapt to incoming inputs at inference. We show that by using a diagonal plus low-rank decomposition of the state transition matrix introduced in S4, and a few simplifications, the LTC-based structured state-space model, dubbed Liquid-S4, improves generalization across sequence modeling tasks with long-term dependencies such as image, text, audio, and medical time-series, with an average performance of 87.32\\% on the Long-Range Arena benchmark.

The performance of current top-performing few-shot classifiers varies widely across different tasks where they often fail on a subset of `difficult' tasks. This phenomenon has real-world consequences for deployed few-shot systems where safety and reliability are paramount, yet little has been done to understand these failure cases. In this paper, we study these difficult tasks to gain a more nuanced understanding of the limitations of current methods. To this end, we develop a general and computationally efficient algorithm called FastDiffSel to extract difficult tasks from any large-scale vision dataset. Notably, our algorithm can extract tasks at least 20x faster than existing methods enabling its use on large-scale datasets. We use FastDiffSel to extract difficult tasks from Meta-Datasset, a widely-used few-shot classification benchmark, and other challenging large-scale vision datasets including ORBIT, CURE-OR and ObjectNet. These tasks are curated into Hard-MD++, a new few-shot testing benchmark to promote the development of methods that are robust to even the most difficult tasks. We use Hard-MD++ to stress-test an extensive suite of few-shot classification methods and show that state-of-the-art approaches fail catastrophically on difficult tasks.

In the meanwhile, under the notion of $L_q$-stability, which is weaker and distribution dependent, exponential generalization bounds are also available yet so far only with sub-optimal rates. Therefore, a fundamental question we would like to address in this paper is whether it is possible to derive near-optimal exponential generalization bounds for $L_q$-stable learning algorithms. As the core contribution of the present work, we give an affirmative answer to this question by developing strict analogues of the near-optimal generalization and risk bounds of uniformly stable algorithms for $L_q$-stable algorithms.

In this paper, we propose the teacher-guided training (TGT) framework for training a high-quality compact model that leverages the knowledge acquired by pretrained generative models, while obviating the need to go through a large volume of data. TGT exploits the fact that the teacher has acquired a good representation of the underlying data domain, which typically corresponds to a much lower dimensional manifold than the input space. Furthermore, we can use the teacher to explore input space more efficiently through sampling or gradient-based methods; thus, making TGT especially attractive for limited data or long-tail settings. We formally capture this benefit of proposed data-domain exploration in our generalization bounds. We find that TGT can improve accuracy on several image classification benchmarks as well as a range of text classification and retrieval tasks",

    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "The spontaneous exchange of turns is a central aspect of human communication. Although turn-taking conventions come to us naturally, artificial dialogue agents struggle to coordinate, and must rely on hard-coded rules to engage in interactive conversations with human interlocutors. In this paper, we investigate the conditions under which artificial agents may naturally develop turn-taking conventions in a simple language game. We describe a cooperative task where success is contingent on the exchange of information along a shared communication channel where talking over each other hinders communication. Despite these environmental constraints, neural-network based agents trained to solve this task with reinforcement learning do not systematically adopt turn-taking conventions. However, we find that agents that do agree on turn-taking protocols end up performing better. Moreover, agents that are forced to perform turn-taking can learn to solve the task more quickly. This suggests that turn-taking may help to generate conversations that are easier for speakers to interpret",

    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) show impressive abilities via few-shot prompting. Commercialized APIs such as OpenAI GPT-3 further increase their use in real-world language applications. However, the crucial problem of how to improve the reliability of GPT-3 is still under-explored. While reliability is a broad and vaguely defined term, we decompose reliability into four main facets that correspond to the existing framework of ML safety and are well-recognized to be important: generalizability, social biases, calibration, and factuality. Our core contribution is to establish simple and effective prompts that improve GPT-3's reliability as it: 1) generalizes out-of-distribution, 2) balances demographic distribution and uses natural language instructions to reduce social biases, 3) calibrates output probabilities, and 4) updates the LLM's factual knowledge and reasoning chains. With appropriate prompts, GPT-3 is more reliable than smaller-scale supervised models on all these facets. We release all processed datasets, evaluation scripts, and model predictions. Our systematic empirical study not only sheds new insights on the reliability of prompting LLMs, but more importantly, our prompting strategies can help practitioners more reliably use LLMs like GPT-3",

    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "Today's computer vision models achieve human or near-human level performance across a wide variety of vision tasks. However, their architectures, data, and learning algorithms differ in numerous ways from those that give rise to human vision. In this paper, we investigate the factors that affect the alignment between the representations learned by neural networks and human mental representations inferred from behavioral responses. We find that model scale and architecture have essentially no effect on the alignment with human behavioral responses, whereas the training dataset and objective function both have a much larger impact. These findings are consistent across three datasets of human similarity judgments collected using two different tasks. Linear transformations of neural network representations learned from behavioral responses from one dataset substantially improve alignment with human similarity judgments on the other two datasets. In addition, we find that some human concepts such as food and animals are well-represented by neural networks whereas others such as royal or sports-related objects are not. Overall, although models trained on larger, more diverse datasets achieve better alignment with humans than models trained on ImageNet alone, our results indicate that scaling alone is unlikely to be sufficient to train neural networks with conceptual representations that match those used by humans",

    "title": "Graph Neural Networks are Inherently Good Generalizers: Insights by Bridging GNNs and MLPs",
    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "Graph neural networks (GNNs), as the de-facto model class for representation learning on graphs, are built upon the multi-layer perceptrons (MLP) architecture with additional message passing layers to allow features to flow across nodes. While conventional wisdom commonly attributes the success of GNNs to their advanced expressivity, we conjecture that this is not the main cause of GNNs' superiority in node-level prediction tasks. This paper pinpoints the major source of GNNs' performance gain to their intrinsic generalization capability, by introducing an intermediate model class dubbed as P(ropagational)MLP, which is identical to standard MLP in training, but then adopts GNN's architecture in testing. Intriguingly, we observe that PMLPs consistently perform on par with (or even exceed) their GNN counterparts, while being much more efficient in training. This finding provides a new perspective for understanding the learning behavior of GNNs, and can be used as an analytic tool for dissecting various GNN-related research problems including expressivity, generalization, over-smoothing and heterophily. As an initial step to analyze PMLP, we show its essential difference to MLP at infinite-width limit lies in the NTK feature map in the post-training stage. Moreover, through extrapolation analysis (i.e., generalization under distribution shifts), we find that though most GNNs and their PMLP counterparts cannot extrapolate non-linear functions for extreme out-of-distribution data, they have greater potential to generalize to testing data near the training data support as natural advantages of the GNN architecture used for inference",

    "abstract": "Pre-trained image-text models, like CLIP, have demonstrated the strong power of vision-language representation learned from a large scale of web-collected image-text data. In light of the well-learned visual features, there are works that transfer image representation to the video domain and achieve good results. However, adapting image-text pre-trained models to video-text pre-training (i.e., post-pretraining) has not demonstrated a significant advantage yet. In this paper, we tackle this challenge by raising and addressing two questions: 1) what are the factors hindering post-pretraining CLIP from improving performance on video-text tasks, and 2) how to mitigate the impact of these factors. Through a series of comparative experiments and analyses, we find that the data scale and domain gap between language sources have large impacts. By these observations, we propose an Omnisource Cross-modal Learning method equipped with a Video Proxy mechanism on the basis of CLIP, namely CLIP-ViP. Extensive results show that our approach improves the performance of CLIP on video-text retrieval by a large margin. Our model achieves state-of-the-art results on a variety of datasets, including MSR-VTT, DiDeMo, LSMDC, and ActivityNet.

    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms can solve challenging control problems directly from image observations, but they often require millions of environment interactions to do so. Recently, model-based RL algorithms have greatly improved sample-efficiency by concurrently learning an internal model of the world, and supplementing real environment interactions with imagined rollouts for policy improvement. However, learning an effective model of the world from scratch is challenging, and in stark contrast to humans that rely heavily on world understanding and visual cues for learning new skills. In this work, we investigate whether internal models learned by modern model-based RL algorithms can be leveraged to solve new, distinctly different tasks faster. We propose Model-Based Cross-Task Transfer (XTRA), a framework for sample-efficient online RL with scalable pretraining and finetuning of learned world models. By offline multi-task pretraining and online cross-task finetuning, we achieve substantial improvements over a baseline trained from scratch; we improve mean performance of model-based algorithm EfficientZero by 23%, and by as much as 71% in some instances.

    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "Given an unlabeled pool of data and the experts who can label them, active learning aims to build an agent that can effectively acquire data to be queried to the experts, maximizing the gain in performance when trained with them. While there are several principles for active learning, a prevailing approach is to estimate uncertainties of predictions for unlabeled samples and use them to define acquisition functions. Active learning with the uncertainty principle works well for deep learning, especially for large-scale image classification tasks with deep neural networks. Still, it is often overlooked how the uncertainty of predictions is estimated, despite the common findings on the difficulty of accurately estimating uncertainties of deep neural networks. In this paper, we highlight the effectiveness of snapshot ensembles for deep active learning. Compared to the previous approaches based on Monte-Carlo dropout or deep ensembles, we show that a simple acquisition strategy based on uncertainties estimated from parameter snapshots gathered from a single optimization path significantly improves the quality of the acquired samples. Based on this observation, we further propose an efficient active learning algorithm that maintains a single learning trajectory throughout the entire active learning episodes, unlike the existing algorithms training models from scratch for every active learning episode. Through the extensive empirical comparison, we demonstrate the effectiveness of snapshot ensembles for deep active learning",

There are two main ingredients in constructing a decoupled learning scheme; 1) how to train the feature extractor for representation learning so that it provides generalizable representations and 2) how to re-train the classifier that constructs proper decision boundaries by handling class imbalances in long-tailed data. In this work, we first apply Stochastic Weight Averaging (SWA), an optimization technique for improving the generalization of deep neural networks, to obtain better generalizing feature extractors for long-tailed classification. We then propose a novel classifier re-training algorithm based on stochastic representation obtained from the SWA-Gaussian, a Gaussian perturbed SWA, and a self-distillation strategy that can harness the diverse stochastic representations based on uncertainty estimates to build more robust classifiers.

    "title": "ViewCo: Discovering Text-Supervised Segmentation Masks via Multi-View Semantic Consistency",
    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "Recently, great success has been made in learning visual representations from text supervision, facilitating the emergence of text-supervised semantic segmentation. However, existing works focus on pixel grouping and cross-modal semantic alignment, while ignoring the correspondence among multiple augmented views of the same image. To overcome such limitation, we propose multi-View Consistent learning (ViewCo) for text-supervised semantic segmentation. Specifically, we first propose text-to-views consistency modeling to learn correspondence for multiple views of the same input image. Additionally, we propose cross-view segmentation consistency modeling to address the ambiguity issue of text supervision by contrasting the segment features of Siamese visual encoders. The text-to-views consistency benefits dense assignment of the visual features by encouraging different crops to align with the same text, while the cross-view segmentation consistency modeling provides additional self-supervision, overcoming the limitation of ambiguous text supervision for segmentation masks. Trained with large-scale image-text data, our model can directly segment objects of arbitrary categories in a zero-shot manner. Extensive experiments show that ViewCo outperforms state-of-the-art methods on average by up to 2.9%, 1.6%, and 2.4% mIoU on PASCAL VOC2012, PASCAL Context, and COCO, respectively",

    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "In this work we propose a Reinforcement Learning (RL) agent that can discover complex behaviours in a rich environment with a simple reward function. We define diversity in terms of state-action occupancy measures, since policies with different occupancy measures visit different states on average. More importantly, defining diversity in this way allows us to derive an intrinsic reward function for maximizing the diversity directly. Our agent, DOMiNO, stands for Diversity Optimization Maintaining Near Optimally. It is based on maximizing a reward function with two components: the extrinsic reward and the diversity intrinsic reward, which are combined with Lagrange multipliers to balance the quality-diversity trade-off. Any RL algorithm can be used to maximize this reward and no other changes are needed. We demonstrate that given a simple reward functions in various control domains, like height (stand) and forward velocity (walk), DOMiNO discovers diverse and meaningful behaviours. We also perform extensive analysis of our approach, compare it with other multi-objective baselines, demonstrate that we can control both the quality and the diversity of the set via interpretable hyperparameters, and show that the set is robust to perturbations of the environment",

    "abstract": "Many recent breakthroughs of deep reinforcement learning (RL) are mainly built upon large-scale distributed training of model-free methods using millions to billions of samples. On the other hand, state-of-the-art model-based RL methods can achieve human-level sample efficiency but often take a much longer over all training time than model-free methods. However, high sample efficiency and fast training time are both important to many real-world applications. We develop SpeedyZero, a distributed RL system built upon a state-of-the-art model-based RL method, EfficientZero, with a dedicated system design for fast distributed computation. We also develop two novel algorithmic techniques, Priority Refresh and Clipped LARS, to stabilize training with massive parallelization and large batch size. SpeedyZero maintains on-par sample efficiency compared with EfficientZero while achieving a 14.5X speedup in wall-clock time, leading to human-level performances on the Atari benchmark within 35 minutes using only 300k samples. In addition, we also present an in-depth analysis on the fundamental challenges in further scaling our system to bring insights to the community",

    "title": "Neural Architecture Design and Robustness: A Dataset",
    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "Deep learning models have proven to be successful in a wide range of machine learning tasks. Yet, they are often highly sensitive to perturbations on the input data which can lead to incorrect decisions with high confidence, hampering their deployment for practical use-cases. Thus, finding architectures that are (more) robust against perturbations has received much attention in recent years. Just like the search for well-performing architectures in terms of clean accuracy, this usually involves a tedious trial-and-error process with one additional challenge: the evaluation of a network's robustness is significantly more expensive than its evaluation for clean accuracy. Thus, the aim of this paper is to facilitate better streamlined research on architectural design choices with respect to their impact on robustness as well as, for example, the evaluation of surrogate measures for robustness. We therefore borrow one of the most commonly considered search spaces for neural architecture search for image classification, NAS-Bench-201, which contains a manageable size of 6466 non-isomorphic network designs. We evaluate all these networks on a range of common adversarial attacks and corruption types and introduce a database on neural architecture design and robustness evaluations. We further present three exemplary use cases of this dataset, in which we (i) benchmark robustness measurements based on Jacobian and Hessian matrices for their robustness predictability, (ii) perform neural architecture search on robust accuracies, and (iii) provide an initial analysis of how architectural design choices affect robustness. We find that carefully crafting the topology of a network can have substantial impact on its robustness, where networks with the same parameter count range in mean adversarial robust accuracy from 20%-41%.

    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "We propose a generic module named Indirection Layer (InLay), which leverages indirection and data internal relationships to effectively construct symbolic indirect representations to improve out-of-distribution generalization capabilities of various neural architectures. InLay receives data input in the form of a sequence of objects, treats it as a complete weighted graph whose vertices are the objects and edge weights are scalars representing relationships between vertices. The input is first mapped via indirection to a symbolic graph with data-independent and trainable vertices. This symbolic graph is then propagated, resulting in new vertex features whose indirection will be used for prediction steps afterward. Theoretically, we show that the distances between indirection representations are bounded by the distances between corresponding graphs, implying that unseen samples with very different surface statistics can still be close in the representation space to the seen samples if they share similar internal relationships. We demonstrate that InLay is consistently effective in improving out-of-distribution generalization throughout a comprehensive suite of experiments, including IQ problems, distorted image classification, and few-shot domain adaptation NLP classification. We also conduct ablation studies to verify different design choices of InLay",

    "title": "Accelerating Guided Diffusion Sampling with Splitting Numerical Methods",

    "abstract": "Guided diffusion is a technique for conditioning the output of a diffusion model at sampling time without retraining the network for each specific task. However, one drawback of diffusion models, whether they are guided or unguided, is their slow sampling process. Recent techniques can accelerate unguided sampling by applying high-order numerical methods to the sampling process when viewed as differential equations. On the contrary, we discover that the same techniques do not work for guided sampling, and little has been explored about its acceleration. This paper explores the culprit of this problem and provides a solution based on operator splitting methods, motivated by our key finding that classical high-order numerical methods are unsuitable for the conditional function. Our proposed method can re-utilize the high-order methods for guided sampling and can generate images with the same quality as a 250-step DDIM baseline using 32-58% less sampling time on ImageNet256. We also demonstrate usage on a wide variety of conditional generation tasks, such as text-to-image generation, colorization, inpainting, and super-resolution",

    "abstract": "We develop fast distribution-free conformal prediction algorithms for obtaining multivalid coverage on exchangeable data in the batch setting. Multivalid coverage guarantees are stronger than marginal coverage guarantees in two ways: (1) They hold even conditional on group membership---that is, the target coverage level $1-\\alpha$ holds conditionally on membership in each of an arbitrary (potentially intersecting) group in a finite collection $\\mathcal{G}$ of regions in the feature space. (2) They hold even conditional on the value of the threshold used to produce the prediction set on a given example. In fact multivalid coverage guarantees hold even when conditioning on group membership and threshold value simultaneously. We give two algorithms: both take as input an arbitrary non-conformity score and an arbitrary collection of possibly intersecting groups $\\mathcal{G}$, and then can equip arbitrary black-box predictors with prediction sets. Our first algorithm is a direct extension of quantile regression, needs to solve only a single convex minimization problem, and produces an estimator which has group-conditional guarantees for each group in $\\mathcal{G}$. Our second algorithm is iterative, and gives the full guarantees of multivalid conformal prediction: prediction sets that are valid conditionally both on group membership and non-conformity threshold.

The Neural Process (NP) is a prominent deep neural network-based BML architecture, which has shown remarkable results in recent years. In its standard formulation, the NP encodes epistemic uncertainty in an amortized, factorized, Gaussian variational (VI) approximation to the BML task posterior (TP), using reparametrized gradients. Prior work studies a range of architectural modifications to boost performance, such as attentive computation paths or improved context aggregation schemes, while the influence of the VI scheme remains under-explored. We aim to bridge this gap by introducing GMM-NP, a novel BML model, which builds on recent work that enables highly accurate, full-covariance Gaussian mixture (GMM) TP approximations by combining VI with natural gradients and trust regions. We show that GMM-NP yields tighter evidence lower bounds, which increases the efficiency of marginal likelihood optimization, leading to improved epistemic uncertainty estimation and accuracy. GMM-NP does not require complex architectural modifications, resulting in a powerful, yet conceptually simple BML model, which outperforms the state of the art on a range of challenging experiments, highlighting its applicability to settings where data is scarce",

    "abstract": "Recent advances in pre-training vision-language models like CLIP have shown great potential in learning transferable visual representations. Nonetheless, for downstream inference, CLIP-like models suffer from either 1) degraded accuracy and robustness in the case of inaccurate text descriptions during retrieval-based inference (the challenge for zero-shot protocol); or 2) breaking the well-established vision-language alignment (the challenge for linear probing). To address them, we propose Decomposed Feature Prompting (DeFo). DeFo leverages a flexible number of learnable embeddings as textual input while maintaining the vision-language dual-model architecture, which enables the model to learn decomposed visual features with the help of feature-level textual prompts. We further use an additional linear layer to perform classification, allowing a scalable size of language inputs. Our empirical study shows DeFo's significance in improving the vision-language models. For example, DeFo obtains 73.2% test accuracy on ImageNet with a ResNet-50 backbone without tuning any pretrained weights of both the vision and language encoder, outperforming zero-shot CLIP by a large margin of 15.0%, and outperforming state-of-the-art vision-language prompt tuning method by 7.6%",

    "abstract": "Quantization of the weights and activations is one of the main methods to reduce the computational footprint of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) training. Current methods enable 4-bit quantization of the forward phase. However, this constitutes only a third of the training process. Reducing the computational footprint of the entire training process requires the quantization of the neural gradients, i.e., the loss gradients with respect to the outputs of intermediate neural layers. Previous works separately showed that accurate 4-bit quantization of the neural gradients needs to (1) be unbiased and (2) have a log scale. However, no previous work aimed to combine both ideas, as we do in this work. Specifically, we examine the importance of having unbiased quantization in quantized neural network training, where to maintain it, and how to combine it with logarithmic quantization. Based on this, we suggest a $\\textit{logarithmic unbiased quantization}$ (LUQ) method to quantize all both the forward and backward phase to 4-bit, achieving state-of-the-art results in 4-bit training without overhead. For example, in ResNet50 on ImageNet, we achieved a degradation of 1.1 %. We further improve this to degradation of only 0.32 % after three epochs of high precision fine-tunining, combined with a variance reduction method---where both these methods add overhead comparable to previously suggested methods.

This unique characteristic makes our approach applicable to datasets without access to the input features, such as solving the inexact graph matching problem.

    "abstract": "Though Self-supervised learning (SSL) has been widely studied as a promising technique for representation learning, it doesn't generalize well on long-tailed datasets due to the majority classes dominating the feature space. Recent work shows that the long-tailed learning performance could be boosted by sampling extra in-domain (ID) data for self-supervised training, however, large-scale ID data which can rebalance the minority classes are expensive to collect. In this paper, we propose an alternative but easy-to-use and effective solution, \\textbf{C}ontrastive with \\textbf{O}ut-of-distribution (OOD) data for \\textbf{L}ong-\\textbf{T}ail learning (COLT), which can effectively exploit OOD data to dynamically re-balance the feature space. We empirically identify the counter-intuitive usefulness of OOD samples in SSL long-tailed learning and principally design a novel SSL method. Concretely, we first localize the `\\emph{head}' and `\\emph{tail}' samples by assigning a tailness score to each OOD sample based on its neighborhoods in the feature space. Then, we propose an online OOD sampling strategy to dynamically re-balance the feature space. Finally, we enforce the model to be capable of distinguishing ID and OOD samples by a distribution-level supervised contrastive loss. Extensive experiments are conducted on various datasets and several state-of-the-art SSL frameworks to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method. The results show that our method significantly improves the performance of SSL on long-tailed datasets by a large margin, and even outperforms previous work which uses external ID data.

However, in reinforcement learning, even for supervised sub-problems such as world model learning, early stopping is not applicable as the dataset is continually evolving. As a solution, we propose a new general method that dynamically adjusts the update to data (UTD) ratio during training based on under- and overfitting detection on a small subset of the continuously collected experience not used for training. We apply our method to DreamerV2, a state-of-the-art model-based reinforcement learning algorithm, and evaluate it on the DeepMind Control Suite and the Atari 100k benchmark. The results demonstrate that one can better balance under- and overestimation by adjusting the UTD ratio with our approach compared to the default setting in DreamerV2 and that it is competitive with an extensive hyperparameter search which is not feasible for many applications. Our method eliminates the need to set the UTD hyperparameter by hand and even leads to a higher robustness with regard to other learning-related hyperparameters further reducing the amount of necessary tuning",

In most MRL methods, molecules are treated as 1D sequential tokens or 2D topology graphs, limiting their ability to incorporate 3D information for downstream tasks and, in particular, making it almost impossible for 3D geometry prediction/generation. In this paper, we propose a universal 3D MRL framework, called Uni-Mol, that significantly enlarges the representation ability and application scope of MRL schemes. Uni-Mol contains two pretrained models with the same SE(3) Transformer architecture: a molecular model pretrained by 209M molecular conformations; a pocket model pretrained by 3M candidate protein pocket data. Besides, Uni-Mol contains several finetuning strategies to apply the pretrained models to various downstream tasks. By properly incorporating 3D information, Uni-Mol outperforms SOTA in 14/15 molecular property prediction tasks. Moreover, Uni-Mol achieves superior performance in 3D spatial tasks, including protein-ligand binding pose prediction, molecular conformation generation, etc. The code, model, and data are made publicly available at https://github.com/dptech-corp/Uni-Mol",

    "abstract": "While deep learning has achieved great success in various fields, a large amount of memory is necessary to train deep neural networks, which hinders the development of massive state-of-the-art models. The reason is the conventional learning rule, backpropagation, should temporarily store input activations of all the layers in the network. To overcome this, recent studies suggested various memory-efficient implementations of backpropagation. However, those approaches incur computational overhead due to the recomputation of activations, slowing down neural network training. In this work, we propose a new learning rule which significantly reduces memory requirements while closely matching the performance of backpropagation. The algorithm combines auxiliary activation with output activation during forward propagation, while only auxiliary activation is used during backward propagation instead of actual input activation to reduce the amount of data to be temporarily stored. We mathematically show that our learning rule can reliably train the networks whose loss landscape is convex if the auxiliary activation satisfies certain conditions. Based on this observation, we suggest candidates of auxiliary activation that satisfy those conditions. Experimental results confirm that the proposed learning rule achieves competitive performance compared to backpropagation in various models such as ResNet, Transformer, BERT, ViT, and MLP-Mixer",

However, compared to standard classifiers, they introduce extra parameters that scale linearly with the number of classes. This makes them infeasible to apply to larger-scale problems. In addition heteroscedastic classifiers introduce a critical temperature hyperparameter which must be tuned. We propose HET-XL, a heteroscedastic classifier whose parameter count when compared to a standard classifier scales independently of the number of classes. In our large-scale settings, we show that we can remove the need to tune the temperature hyperparameter, by directly learning it on the training data. On large image classification datasets with up to 4B images and 30k classes our method requires 14X fewer additional parameters, does not require tuning the temperature on a held-out set and performs consistently better than the baseline heteroscedastic classifier. HET-XL improves ImageNet 0-shot classification in a multimodal contrastive learning setup which can be viewed as a 3.5 billion class classification problem",

    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "This paper focuses on data augmentation for low-resource NLP tasks where the training set is limited. The existing solutions either leverage task-independent heuristic rules (e.g., Synonym Replacement) or fine-tune general-purpose pre-trained language models (e.g., GPT2) using the limited training instances to produce new synthetic data. Consequently, they have trivial task-specific knowledge and are limited to yielding low-quality synthetic data. To combat this issue, we propose Knowledge Mixture Data Augmentation Model (KnowDA), a Seq2Seq language model pretrained on a mixture of diverse NLP tasks under a novel framework of Knowledge Mixture Training (KoMT). The goal of KoMT is to condense diverse NLP task-specific knowledge into the single KnowDA model (i.e., all-in-one). The resulting KnowDA could utilize these knowledge to quickly grasp the inherent synthesis law of the target task through limited training instances. Specifically, KoMT reformulates input examples from various heterogeneous NLP tasks into a unified text-to-text format and employs denoising training objectives in different granularity to learn to reconstruct partial or complete samples. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to attempt to apply 100+ NLP multi-task training for data augmentation. Extensive experiments show that i) the synthetic data produced by KnowDA successfully improves the performance of the strong pre-trained language models (i.e., Bert, ALBert and Deberta) by a large margin on the low-resource NLP benchmark FewGLUE, CoNLL'03 and WikiAnn; ii) KnowDA successful transfer the task knowledge to NLP tasks whose types are seen and unseen in KoMT",

    "title": "Finding the Global Semantic Representation in GAN through Fréchet Mean",
    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "The ideally disentangled latent space in GAN involves the global representation of latent space using semantic attribute coordinates. In other words, in this disentangled space, there exists the global semantic basis as a vector space where each basis component describes one attribute of generated images. In this paper, we propose an unsupervised method for finding this global semantic basis in the intermediate latent space in GANs. This semantic basis represents sample-independent meaningful perturbations that change the same semantic attribute of an image on the entire latent space. The proposed global basis, called Fréchet basis, is derived by introducing Fréchet mean to the local semantic perturbations in a latent space. Fréchet basis is discovered in two stages. First, the global semantic subspace is discovered by the Fréchet mean in the Grassmannian manifold of the local semantic subspaces. Second, Fréchet basis is found by optimizing a basis of the semantic subspace via the Fréchet mean in the Special Orthogonal Group. Experimental results demonstrate that Fréchet basis provides better semantic factorization and robustness compared to the previous methods. Moreover, we suggest the basis refinement scheme for the previous methods. The quantitative experiments show that the refined basis achieves better semantic factorization while constrained on the same semantic subspace given by the previous method",

    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "Tensor decompositions have been successfully applied to compress neural networks. The compression algorithms using tensor decompositions commonly minimize the approximation error on the weights. Recent work assumes the approximation error on the weights is a proxy for the performance of the model to compress multiple layers and fine-tune the compressed model. Surprisingly, little research has systematically evaluated which approximation errors can be used to make choices regarding the layer, tensor decomposition method, and level of compression. To close this gap, we perform an experimental study to test if this assumption holds across different layers and types of decompositions, and what the effect of fine-tuning is. We include the approximation error on the features resulting from a compressed layer in our analysis to test if this provides a better proxy, as it explicitly takes the data into account. We find the approximation error on the weights has a positive correlation with the performance error, before as well as after fine-tuning. Basing the approximation error on the features does not improve the correlation significantly. While scaling the approximation error commonly is used to account for the different sizes of layers, the average correlation across layers is smaller than across all choices (i.e. layers, decompositions, and level of compression) before fine-tuning. When calculating the correlation across the different decompositions, the average rank correlation is larger than across all choices. This means multiple decompositions can be considered for compression and the approximation error can be used to choose between them",

    "title": "Hyperbolic Self-paced Learning for Self-supervised Skeleton-based Action Representations",
    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "Self-paced learning has been beneficial for tasks where some initial knowledge is available, such as weakly supervised learning and domain adaptation, to select and order the training sample sequence, from easy to complex. However its applicability remains unexplored in unsupervised learning, whereby the knowledge of the task matures during training. We propose a novel HYperbolic Self-Paced model (HYSP) for learning skeletonbased action representations. HYSP adopts self-supervision: it uses data augmentations to generate two views of the same sample, and it learns by matching one (named online) to the other (the target). We propose to use hyperbolic uncertainty to determine the algorithmic learning pace, under the assumption that less uncertain samples should be more strongly driving the training, with a larger weight and pace. Hyperbolic uncertainty is a by-product of the adopted hyperbolic neural networks, it matures during training and it comes with no extra cost, compared to the established Euclidean SSL framework counterparts. When tested on three established skeleton-based action recognition datasets, HYSP outperforms the state-of-the-art on PKU-MMD I, as well as on 2 out of 3 downstream tasks on NTU-60 and NTU-120. Additionally, HYSP only uses positive pairs and bypasses therefore the complex and computationally-demanding mining procedures required for the negatives in contrastive techniques.

    "abstract": "MuZero Unplugged presents a promising approach for offline policy learning from logged data. It conducts Monte-Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) with a learned model and leverages Reanalyze algorithm to learn purely from offline data. For good performance, MCTS requires accurate learned models and a large number of simulations, thus costing huge computing time. This paper investigates a few hypotheses where MuZero Unplugged may not work well under the offline RL settings, including 1) learning with limited data coverage; 2) learning from offline data of stochastic environments; 3) improperly parameterized models given the offline data; 4) with a low compute budget. We propose to use a regularized one-step look-ahead approach to tackle the above issues. Instead of planning with the expensive MCTS, we use the learned model to construct an advantage estimation based on a one-step rollout. Policy improvements are towards the direction that maximizes the estimated advantage with regularization of the dataset. We conduct extensive empirical studies with BSuite environments to verify the hypotheses and then run our algorithm on the RL Unplugged Atari benchmark. Experimental results show that our proposed approach achieves stable performance even with an inaccurate learned model. On the large-scale Atari benchmark, the proposed method outperforms MuZero Unplugged by 43%. Most significantly, it uses only 5.6% wall-clock time (i.e., 1 hour) compared to MuZero Unplugged (i.e., 17.8 hours) to achieve a 150% IQM normalized score with the same hardware and software stacks.

    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "The aim of continual learning is to learn new tasks continuously (i.e., plasticity) without forgetting previously learned knowledge from old tasks (i.e., stability). In the scenario of online continual learning, wherein data comes strictly in a streaming manner, the plasticity of online continual learning is more vulnerable than offline continual learning because the training signal that can be obtained from a single data point is limited. To overcome the stability-plasticity dilemma in online continual learning, we propose an online continual learning framework named multi-scale feature adaptation network (MuFAN) that utilizes a richer context encoding extracted from different levels of a pre-trained network. Additionally, we introduce a novel structure-wise distillation loss and replace the commonly used batch normalization layer with a newly proposed stability-plasticity normalization module to train MuFAN that simultaneously maintains high plasticity and stability. MuFAN outperforms other state-of-the-art continual learning methods on the SVHN, CIFAR100, miniImageNet, and CORe50 datasets. Extensive experiments and ablation studies validate the significance and scalability of each proposed component: 1) multi-scale feature maps from a pre-trained encoder, 2) the structure-wise distillation loss, and 3) the stability-plasticity normalization module in MuFAN.

    "abstract": "The recently proposed data augmentation TransMix employs attention labels to help visual transformers (ViT) achieve better robustness and performance. However, TransMix is deficient in two aspects: 1) The image cropping method of TransMix may not be suitable for vision transformer. 2) At the early stage of training, the model produces unreliable attention maps. TransMix uses unreliable attention maps to compute mixed attention labels that can affect the model. To address the aforementioned issues, we propose MaskMix and Progressive Attention Labeling (PAL) in image and label space, respectively. In detail, from the perspective of image space, we design MaskMix, which mixes two images based on a patch-like grid mask. In particular, the size of each mask patch is adjustable and is a multiple of the image patch size, which ensures each image patch comes from only one image and contains more global contents. From the perspective of label space, we design PAL, which utilizes a progressive factor to dynamically re-weight the attention weights of the mixed attention label. Finally, we combine MaskMix and Progressive Attention Labeling as our new data augmentation method, named MixPro. The experimental results show that our method can improve various ViT-based models at scales on ImageNet classification (73.8% top-1 accuracy based on DeiT-T for 300 epochs). After being pre-trained with MixPro on ImageNet, the ViT-based models also demonstrate better transferability to semantic segmentation, object detection, and instance segmentation. Furthermore, compared to TransMix, MixPro also shows stronger robustness on several benchmarks",

We combine 2D TOCS maps with an independent appearance code to condition a StyleGAN-based deferred neural rendering (DNR) network for foreground image (object) synthesis; we use a separate code for background synthesis and do late fusion to deliver the final result.

    "abstract": "Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have shown great promise in various graph learning tasks. However, the computational overheads of fitting GNNs to large-scale graphs grow rapidly, posing obstacles to GNNs from scaling up to real-world applications. To tackle this issue, Graph Lottery Ticket (GLT) hypothesis articulates that there always exists a sparse subnetwork/subgraph with admirable performance in GNNs with random initialization. Such a pair of core subgraph and sparse subnetwork (called graph lottery tickets) can be uncovered by iteratively applying a novel sparsification method. While GLT provides new insights for GNN compression, it requires a full pretraining process to obtain graph lottery tickets, which is not universal and friendly to real-world applications. Moreover, the graph sparsification in GLT utilizes sampling techniques, which may result in massive information loss and aggregation failure. In this paper, we explore the searching of graph lottery tickets from a complementary perspective -- transforming a random ticket into a graph lottery ticket, which allows us to more comprehensively explore the relationships between the original network/graph and their sparse counterpart. To achieve this, we propose regularization-based network pruning and hierarchical graph sparsification, leading to our Dual Graph Lottery Ticket (DGLT) framework for a joint sparsification of network and graph. Compared to GLT, our DGLT helps achieve a triple-win situation of graph lottery tickets with high sparsity, admirable performance, and good explainability. More importantly, we rigorously prove that our model can eliminate noise and maintain reliable information in substructures using the graph information bottleneck theory.

However, all existing VidSGG methods are fully-supervised, i.e., they need dense and costly manual annotations. In this paper, we propose the first weakly-supervised VidSGG task with only single-frame weak supervision: SF-VidSGG. By ``weakly-supervised\", we mean that SF-VidSGG relaxes the training supervision from two different levels: 1) It only provides single-frame annotations instead of all-frame annotations. 2) The single-frame ground-truth annotation is still a weak image SGG annotation, i.e., an unlocalized scene graph. To solve this new task, we also propose a novel Pseudo Label Assignment based method, dubbed as PLA. PLA is a two-stage method, which generates pseudo visual relation annotations for the given video at the first stage, and then trains a fully-supervised VidSGG model with these pseudo labels. Specifically, PLA consists of three modules: an object PLA module, a predicate PLA module, and a future predicate prediction (FPP) module. Firstly, in the object PLA, we localize all objects for every frame. Then, in the predicate PLA, we design two different teachers to assign pseudo predicate labels. Lastly, in the FPP module, we fusion these two predicate pseudo labels by the regularity of relation transition in videos. Extensive ablations and results on the benchmark Action Genome have demonstrated the effectiveness of our PLA",

Yet, these approaches only produce meaningful results if the nearest neighbors themselves are meaningful.

This problem can be circumvented by self-supervised approaches based on contrastive learning, such as SimCLR, relying on data augmentation to generate implicit neighbors, but these methods do not produce two-dimensional embeddings suitable for visualization. Here, we present a new method, called t-SimCNE, for unsupervised visualization of image data. T-SimCNE combines ideas from contrastive learning and neighbor embeddings, and trains a parametric mapping from the high-dimensional pixel space into two dimensions. We show that the resulting 2D embeddings achieve classification accuracy comparable to the state-of-the-art high-dimensional SimCLR representations, thus faithfully capturing semantic relationships.

    "abstract": "Sequence-to-Sequence (seq2seq) tasks transcribe the input sequence to a target sequence. The Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) criterion is widely used in multiple seq2seq tasks. Besides predicting the target sequence, a side product of CTC is to predict the alignment, which is the most probable input-long sequence that specifies a hard aligning relationship between the input and target units. As there are multiple potential aligning sequences (called paths) that are equally considered in CTC formulation, the choice of which path will be most probable and become the predicted alignment is always uncertain. In addition, it is usually observed that the alignment predicted by vanilla CTC will drift compared with its reference and rarely provides practical functionalities. Thus, the motivation of this work is to make the CTC alignment prediction controllable and thus equip CTC with extra functionalities. The Bayes risk CTC (BRCTC) criterion is then proposed in this work, in which a customizable Bayes risk function is adopted to enforce the desired characteristics of the predicted alignment. With the risk function, the BRCTC is a general framework to adopt some customizable preference over the paths in order to concentrate the posterior into a particular subset of the paths. In applications, we explore one particular preference which yields models with the down-sampling ability and reduced inference costs. By using BRCTC with another preference for early emissions, we obtain an improved performance-latency trade-off for online models. Experimentally, the proposed BRCTC reduces the inference cost of offline models by up to 47% without performance degradation and cuts down the overall latency of online systems to an unseen level",

Here, we note that benchmark image datasets such as CIFAR-10 are carefully curated, and we formulate SSL objectives as a log-likelihood in a generative model of data curation. We show that SSL objectives, from entropy minimization and pseudo-labelling, to state-of-the-art techniques similar to FixMatch can be understood as lower-bounds on our principled log-likelihood. We are thus able to introduce a Bayesian extension of SSL, which gives considerable improvements over standard SSL in the setting of 40 labelled points on CIFAR-10, with performance of $92.2\\pm 0.3\\%$ vs $88.6\\%$ in the original FixMatch paper. Finally, our theory suggests that SSL is effective in part due to the statistical patterns induced by data curation. This provides an explanation of past results which show SSL performs better on clean datasets without any ``out of distribution'' examples. Confirming these results we find that SSL gave much larger performance improvements on curated than on uncurated data, using matched curated and uncurated datasets based on Galaxy Zoo 2",

This work focuses on blind flexible self-docking, where we aim to predict the positions, orientations and conformations of docked molecules.

Recently, data-driven methods based on deep learning techniques are attracting growing interest thanks to their efficiency during inference and promising performance. These methods usually either adopt a two-stage approach by first predicting the distances between proteins and ligands and then generating the final coordinates based on the predicted distances, or directly predicting the global roto-translation of ligands.

Our further analysis reveals the reason is that deep graph transformers are limited by the vanishing capacity of global attention, restricting the graph transformer from focusing on the critical substructure and obtaining expressive features. To this end, we propose a novel graph transformer model named DeepGraph that explicitly employs substructure tokens in the encoded representation, and applies local attention on related nodes to obtain substructure based attention encoding. Our model enhances the ability of the global attention to focus on substructures and promotes the expressiveness of the representations, addressing the limitation of self-attention as the graph transformer deepens. Experiments show that our method unblocks the depth limitation of graph transformers and results in state-of-the-art performance across various graph benchmarks with deeper models",

    "title": "Versatile Neural Processes for Learning Implicit Neural Representations",
    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "Representing a signal as a continuous function parameterized by neural network (a.k.a. Implicit Neural Representations, INRs) has attracted increasing attention in recent years. Neural Processes (NPs), which model the distributions over functions conditioned on partial observations (context set), provide a practical solution for fast inference of continuous functions. However, existing NP architectures suffer from inferior modeling capability for complex signals. In this paper, we propose an efficient NP framework dubbed Versatile Neural Processes (VNP), which largely increases the capability of approximating functions. Specifically, we introduce a bottleneck encoder that produces fewer and informative context tokens, relieving the high computational cost while providing high modeling capability. At the decoder side, we hierarchically learn multiple global latent variables that jointly model the global structure and the uncertainty of a function, enabling our model to capture the distribution of complex signals. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed VNP on a variety of tasks involving 1D, 2D and 3D signals. Particularly, our method shows promise in learning accurate INRs w.r.t. a 3D scene without further finetuning",

    "title": "Classically Approximating Variational Quantum Machine Learning with Random Fourier Features",
    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "Many applications of quantum computing in the near term rely on variational quantum circuits (VQCs). They have been showcased as a promising model for reaching a quantum advantage in machine learning with current noisy intermediate scale quantum computers (NISQ). It is often believed that the power of VQCs relies on their exponentially large feature space, and extensive works have explored the expressiveness and trainability of VQCs in that regard. In our work, we propose a classical sampling method that can closely approximate most VQCs with Hamiltonian encoding, given only the description of their architecture. It uses the seminal proposal of Random Fourier Features (RFF) and the fact that VQCs can be seen as large Fourier series. We show theoretically and experimentally that models built from exponentially large quantum feature space can be classically reproduced by sampling a few frequencies to build an equivalent low dimensional kernel. Precisely, we show that the number of required samples grows favourably with the size of the quantum spectrum. This tool therefore questions the hope for quantum advantage from VQCs in many cases, but conversely helps to narrow the conditions for their potential success. We expect VQCs with various and complex encoding Hamiltonians, or with large input dimension, to become more robust to classical approximations",

All the existing algorithms adhere to the same reward learning principle, where the adaptive return is simply formulated in the form of expected cumulative rewards, upon which the policy and critic update rules are specified under well-adopted distance metrics. In this paper, we present a novel algorithm that builds on the success of meta-gradient RL algorithms and effectively improves such algorithms by following a simple recipe, i.e., going beyond the expected return to formulate and learn the return in a more expressive form, value distributions. To this end, we first formulate a distributional return that could effectively capture bootstrapping and discounting behaviors over distributions, to form an informative distributional return target in value update. Then we derive an efficient meta update rule to learn the adaptive distributional return with meta-gradients. For empirical evaluation, we first present an illustrative example on a toy two-color grid-world domain, which validates the benefit of learning distributional return over expectation; then we conduct extensive comparisons on a large-scale RL benchmark Atari 2600, where we confirm that our proposed method with distributional return works seamlessly well with the actor-critic framework and leads to state-of-the-art median human normalized score among meta-gradient RL literature",

    "abstract": "Federated Learning (FL) aims to develop a centralized server that learns from distributed clients via communications without accessing the clients' local data. However, existing works mainly focus on federated learning in a single task sce- nario with static data. In this paper, we introduce the continual federated learning (CFL) problem, where clients incrementally learn new tasks and history data can- not be stored due to certain reasons, such as limited storage and data retention policy 1. Generative replay (GR) based methods are effective for continual learning without storing history data. However, we fail when trying to intuitively adapt GR models for this setting. By analyzing the behaviors of clients during training, we find the unstable training process caused by distributed training on non-IID data leads to a notable performance degradation. To address this problem, we propose our FedCIL model with two simple but effective solutions: 1. model consolidation and 2. consistency enforcement. Experimental results on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms baselines. Code is available at: https://github.com/daiqing98/FedCIL",

However, existing AAD approaches usually prioritize the samples with the highest anomaly scores for user labeling, which hinders the exploration of anomalies that were initially ranked lower. Besides, most existing AAD approaches are specially tailored for a certain unsupervised detector, making it difficult to extend to other detection models. To tackle these problems, we propose a lightweight, model-agnostic and diversity-aware AAD method, named LMADA. In LMADA, we design a diversity-aware sample selector powered by Determinantal Point Process (DPP). It considers the diversity of samples in addition to their anomaly scores for feedback querying. Furthermore, we propose a model-agnostic tuner. It approximates diverse unsupervised detectors with a unified proxy model, based on which the feedback information is incorporated by a lightweight non-linear representation adjuster. Through extensive experiments on 8 public datasets, LMADA achieved 74% F1-Score improvement on average, outperforming other comparative AAD approaches. Besides, LMADA can also achieve significant performance boosting under any unsupervised detectors",

    "abstract": "Many real-world continuous control problems are in the dilemma of weighing the pros and cons, multi-objective reinforcement learning (MORL) serves as a generic framework of learning control policies for different preferences over objectives. However, the existing MORL methods either rely on multiple passes of explicit search for finding the Pareto front and therefore are not sample-efficient, or utilizes a shared policy network for coarse knowledge sharing among policies. To boost the sample efficiency of MORL, we propose $Q$-Pensieve, a policy improvement scheme that stores a collection of $Q$-snapshots to jointly determine the policy update direction and thereby enables data sharing at the policy level. We show that $Q$-Pensieve can be naturally integrated with soft policy iteration with convergence guarantee. To substantiate this concept, we propose the technique of $Q$ replay buffer, which stores the learned $Q$-networks from the past iterations, and arrive at a practical actor-critic implementation. Through extensive experiments and an ablation study, we demonstrate that with much fewer samples, the proposed algorithm can outperform the benchmark MORL methods on a variety of MORL benchmark tasks",

This is prohibitively large for a variety of applications especially in web-page translation, query-answering etc. Consequently, several approaches have been developed recently to speedup attention computation by enforcing different attention structures such as sparsity, low-rank, approximating attention using kernels. In this work, we view attention computation as that of nearest neighbor retrieval, and use decision tree based hierarchical navigation to reduce the retrieval cost per query token from linear in sequence length to nearly logarithmic. Based on such hierarchical navigation, we design Treeformer which can use one of two efficient attention layers -- TF-Attention and TC-Attention. TF-Attention computes the attention in a fine-grained style, while TC-Attention is a coarse attention layer which also ensures that the gradients are \"dense\". To optimize such challenging discrete layers, we propose a two-level bootstrapped training method. Using extensive experiments on standard NLP benchmarks, especially for long-sequences, we demonstrate that our Treeformer architecture can be almost as accurate as baseline Transformer while using 30x lesser FLOPs in the attention layer. Compared to Linformer, the accuracy can be as much as 12% higher while using similar FLOPs in the attention layer",

Compared to previous classification activation mapping works, Grad-ODAM generates instance-specific explanations rather than class-specific ones. We show that Grad-ODAM is applicable to both one-stage detectors such as FCOS and two-stage detectors such as Faster R-CNN, and produces higher-quality visual explanations than the state-of-the-art both effectively and efficiently. We next propose a training scheme, ODAM-Train, to improve the explanation ability on object discrimination of the detector through encouraging consistency between explanations for detections on the same object, and distinct explanations for detections on different objects. Based on the heat maps produced by Grad-ODAM with ODAM-Train, we propose ODAM-NMS, which considers the information of the model's explanation for each prediction to distinguish the duplicate detected objects.

    "abstract": "Beyond the success story of adversarial training (AT) in the recent text domain on top of pre-trained language models (PLMs), our empirical study showcases the inconsistent gains from AT on some tasks, e.g. commonsense reasoning, named entity recognition. This paper investigates AT from the perspective of the contextualized language representation outputted by PLM encoders. We find the current AT attacks lean to generate sub-optimal adversarial examples that can fool the decoder part but have a minor effect on the encoder. However, we find it necessary to effectively deviate the latter one to allow AT to gain. Based on the observation, we propose simple yet effective \\textit{Contextualized representation-Adversarial Training} (CreAT), in which the attack is explicitly optimized to deviate the contextualized representation of the encoder. It allows a global optimization of adversarial examples that can fool the entire model. We also find CreAT gives rise to a better direction to optimize the adversarial examples, to let them less sensitive to hyperparameters. Compared to AT, CreAT produces consistent performance gains on a wider range of tasks and is proven to be more effective for language pre-training where only the encoder part is kept for downstream tasks. We achieve the new state-of-the-art performances on a series of challenging benchmarks, e.g. AdvGLUE (59.1 $ \\rightarrow $ 61.1), HellaSWAG (93.0 $ \\rightarrow $ 94.9), ANLI (68.1 $ \\rightarrow $ 69.3)",

In this paper, we propose a novel representation learning method, Gromov-Wasserstein Autoencoders (GWAE), which directly matches the latent and data distributions using the variational autoencoding scheme. Instead of likelihood-based objectives, GWAE models minimize the Gromov-Wasserstein (GW) metric between the trainable prior and given data distributions. The GW metric measures the distance structure-oriented discrepancy between distributions even with different dimensionalities, which provides a direct measure between the latent and data spaces. By restricting the prior family, we can introduce meta-priors into the latent space without changing their objective. The empirical comparisons with VAE-based models show that GWAE models work in two prominent meta-priors, disentanglement and clustering, with their GW objective unchanged",

We build on this work and identify in closed-form the family of Activation Functions (AFs) that minimize a combination of the test error and sensitivity of the RFR under different notions of functional parsimony. We find scenarios under which the optimal AFs are linear, saturated linear functions, or expressible in terms of Hermite polynomials.

    "abstract": "The ability to decompose complex natural scenes into meaningful object-centric abstractions lies at the core of human perception and reasoning. In the recent culmination of unsupervised object-centric learning, the Slot-Attention module has played an important role with its simple yet effective design and fostered many powerful variants. These methods, however, have been exceedingly difficult to train without supervision and are ambiguous in the notion of object, especially for complex natural scenes. In this paper, we propose to address these issues by investigating the potential of learnable queries as initializations for Slot-Attention learning, uniting it with efforts from existing attempts on improving Slot-Attention learning with bi-level optimization. With simple code adjustments on Slot-Attention, our model, Bi-level Optimized Query Slot Attention, achieves state-of-the-art results on 3 challenging synthetic and 7 complex real-world datasets in unsupervised image segmentation and reconstruction, outperforming previous baselines by a large margin. We provide thorough ablative studies to validate the necessity and effectiveness of our design. Additionally, our model exhibits great potential for concept binding and zero-shot learning.

    "title": "Feature Reconstruction From Outputs Can Mitigate Simplicity Bias in Neural Networks",
    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "Deep Neural Networks are known to be brittle to even minor distribution shifts compared to the training distribution. While one line of work has demonstrated that \\emph{Simplicity Bias} (SB) of DNNs -- bias towards learning only the simplest features -- is a key reason for this brittleness, another recent line of work has surprisingly found that diverse/ complex features are indeed learned by the backbone, and their brittleness is due to the linear classification head relying primarily on the simplest features. To bridge the gap between these two lines of work, we first hypothesize and verify that while SB may not altogether preclude learning complex features, it amplifies simpler features over complex ones. Namely, simple features are replicated several times in the learned representations while complex features might not be replicated. This phenomenon, we term \\emph{Feature Replication Hypothesis}, coupled with the \\emph{Implicit Bias} of SGD to converge to maximum margin solutions in the feature space, leads the models to rely mostly on the simple features for classification. To mitigate this bias, we propose \\emph{Feature Reconstruction Regularizer (FRR)} to ensure that the learned features can be reconstructed back from the logits. The use of \\emph{FRR} in linear layer training (\\emph{FRR-L}) encourages the use of more diverse features for classification. We further propose to finetune the full network by freezing the weights of the linear layer trained using \\emph{FRR-L}, to refine the learned features, making them more suitable for classification. Using this simple solution, we demonstrate up to 15\\% gains in OOD accuracy on the recently introduced semi-synthetic datasets with extreme distribution shifts. Moreover, we demonstrate noteworthy gains over existing SOTA methods on the standard OOD benchmark DomainBed as well",

    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "Unsupervised reinforcement learning (URL) poses a promising paradigm to learn useful behaviors in a task-agnostic environment without the guidance of extrinsic rewards to facilitate the fast adaptation of various downstream tasks. Previous works focused on the pre-training in a model-free manner while lacking the study of transition dynamics modeling that leaves a large space for the improvement of sample efficiency in downstream tasks. To this end, we propose an Efficient Unsupervised Reinforcement Learning Framework with Multi-choice Dynamics model (EUCLID), which introduces a novel model-fused paradigm to jointly pre-train the dynamics model and unsupervised exploration policy in the pre-training phase, thus better leveraging the environmental samples and improving the downstream task sampling efficiency. However, constructing a generalizable model which captures the local dynamics under different behaviors remains a challenging problem. We introduce the multi-choice dynamics model that covers different local dynamics under different behaviors concurrently, which uses different heads to learn the state transition under different behaviors during unsupervised pre-training and selects the most appropriate head for prediction in the downstream task. Experimental results in the manipulation and locomotion domains demonstrate that EUCLID achieves state-of-the-art performance with high sample efficiency, basically solving the state-based URLB benchmark and reaching a mean normalized score of 104.0±1.2% in downstream tasks with 100k fine-tuning steps, which is equivalent to DDPG's performance at 2M interactive steps with 20× more data.

    "abstract": "3D convolution neural networks (CNNs) have been the prevailing option for video recognition. To capture the temporal information, 3D convolutions are computed along the sequences, leading to cubically growing and expensive computations. To reduce the computational cost, previous methods resort to manually designed 3D/2D CNN structures with approximations or automatic search, which sacrifice the modeling ability or make training time-consuming. In this work, we propose to automatically design efficient 3D CNN architectures via a novel training-free neural architecture search approach tailored for 3D CNNs considering the model complexity. To measure the expressiveness of 3D CNNs efficiently, we formulate a 3D CNN as an information system and derive an analytic entropy score, based on the Maximum Entropy Principle. Specifically, we propose a spatio-temporal entropy score (STEntr-Score) with a refinement factor to handle the discrepancy of visual information in spatial and temporal dimensions, through dynamically leveraging the correlation between the feature map size and kernel size depth-wisely. Highly efficient and expressive 3D CNN architectures, i.e., entropy-based 3D CNNs (E3D family), can then be efficiently searched by maximizing the STEntr-Score under a given computational budget, via an evolutionary algorithm without training the network parameters. Extensive experiments on Something-Something V1&V2 and Kinetics400 demonstrate that the E3D family achieves state-of-the-art performance with higher computational efficiency",

In this work, we propose the adoption of latent variable policies within the MaxEnt framework, which we can provably approximate any policy distribution, and additionally, naturally emerges under the use of world models with a latent belief state. We discuss why latent variable policies are difficult to train, how naive approaches can fail, and subsequently introduce a series of improvements centered around low-cost marginalization of the latent state, allowing us to make full use of the latent state at minimal additional cost. We instantiate our method under the actor-critic framework, marginalizing both the actor and critic. The resulting algorithm, referred to as Stochastic Marginal Actor-Critic (SMAC), is simple yet effective. We experimentally validate our method on continuous control tasks, showing that effective marginalization can lead to better exploration and more robust training.

    "abstract": "The neural collapse (NC) phenomenon describes an underlying geometric symmetry for deep neural networks, where both deeply learned features and classifiers converge to a simplex equiangular tight frame. It has been shown that both cross-entropy loss and mean square error can provably lead to NC. We remove NC's key assumption on the feature dimension and the number of classes, and then present a generalized neural collapse (GNC) hypothesis that effectively subsumes the original NC. Inspired by how NC characterizes the training target of neural networks, we decouple GNC into two objectives: minimal intra-class variability and maximal inter-class separability. We then use hyperspherical uniformity (which characterizes the degree of uniformity on the unit hypersphere) as a unified framework to quantify these two objectives. Finally, we propose a general objective -- hyperspherical uniformity gap (HUG), which is defined by the difference between inter-class and intra-class hyperspherical uniformity. HUG not only provably converges to GNC, but also decouples GNC into two separate objectives. Unlike cross-entropy loss that couples intra-class compactness and inter-class separability, HUG enjoys more flexibility and serves as a good alternative loss function. Empirical results show that HUG works well in terms of generalization and robustness",

    "abstract": "Click-through rate (CTR) prediction plays important role in the advertisement, recommendation, and retrieval applications. Given the feature set, how to fully utilize the information from the feature set is an active topic in deep CTR model designs. There are several existing deep CTR works focusing on feature interactions, feature attentions, and so on. They attempt to capture high-order feature interactions to enhance the generalization ability of deep CTR models. However, these works either suffer from poor high-order feature interaction modeling using DNN or ignore the balance between generalization and memorization during the recommendation. To mitigate these problems, we propose an adaptive feature fusion framework called MaskFusion, to additionally capture the explicit interactions between the input feature and the existing deep part structure of deep CTR models dynamically, besides the common feature interactions proposed in existing works. MaskFusion is an instance-aware feature augmentation method, which makes deep CTR models more personalized by assigning each feature with an instance-adaptive mask and fusing each feature with each hidden state vector in the deep part structure. MaskFusion can also be integrated into any existing deep CTR models flexibly. MaskFusion achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on all seven benchmarks deep CTR models with three public datasets",

However, its effects on 3D human body pose and shape estimation (3DHPSE) are open to question, whose target is fixed to a unique class, the human, and has an inherent task gap with SSL. We empirically study and analyze the effects of SSL and further compare it with other pre-training alternatives for 3DHPSE. The alternatives are 2D annotation-based pre-training and synthetic data pre-training, which share the motivation of SSL that aims to reduce the labeling cost. They have been widely utilized as a source of weak-supervision or fine-tuning, but have not been remarked as a pre-training source. SSL methods underperform the conventional ImageNet classification pre-training on multiple 3DHPSE benchmarks by 7.7% on average. In contrast, despite a much less amount of pre-training data, the 2D annotation-based pre-training improves accuracy on all benchmarks and shows faster convergence during fine-tuning.

While some prior works have applied such image GANs to unconditional 2D portrait video generation and static 3D portrait synthesis, there are few works successfully extending GANs for generating 3D-aware portrait videos. In this work, we propose PV3D, the first generative framework that can synthesize multi-view consistent portrait videos. Specifically, our method extends the recent static 3D-aware image GAN to the video domain by generalizing the 3D implicit neural representation to model the spatio-temporal space. To introduce motion dynamics into the generation process, we develop a motion generator by stacking multiple motion layers to generate motion features via modulated convolution. To alleviate motion ambiguities caused by camera/human motions, we propose a simple yet effective camera condition strategy for PV3D, enabling both temporal and multi-view consistent video generation. Moreover, PV3D introduces two discriminators for regularizing the spatial and temporal domains to ensure the plausibility of the generated portrait videos. These elaborated designs enable PV3D to generate 3D-aware motion-plausible portrait videos with high-quality appearance and geometry, significantly outperforming prior works. As a result, PV3D is able to support downstream applications such as static portrait animation and view-consistent motion editing. Code and models are available at https://showlab.github.io/pv3d",

It is an efficient and useful post-hoc method for studying the interpretability of machine learning models without the need of expensive model re-training. Recently, graph convolution networks (GCNs), which operate on graph data, have attracted a great deal of attention. However, there is no preceding research on the influence functions of GCNs to shed light on the effects of removing training nodes/edges from an input graph. Since the nodes/edges in a graph are interdependent in GCNs, it is challenging to derive influence functions for GCNs. To fill this gap, we started with the simple graph convolution (SGC) model that operates on an attributed graph, and formulated an influence function to approximate the changes of model parameters when a node or an edge is removed from an attributed graph. Moreover, we theoretically analyzed the error bound of the estimated influence of removing an edge. We experimentally validated the accuracy and effectiveness of our influence estimation function. In addition, we showed that the influence function of a SGC model could be used to estimate the impact of removing training nodes/edges on the test performance of the SGC without re-training the model.

The value of sliced Wasserstein distance is the average of transportation cost between one-dimensional representations (projections) of original measures that are obtained by Radon Transform (RT). Despite its efficiency in the number of supports, estimating the sliced Wasserstein requires a relatively large number of projections in high-dimensional settings. Therefore, for applications where the number of supports is relatively small compared with the dimension, e.g., several deep learning applications where the mini-batch approaches are utilized, the complexities from matrix multiplication of Radon Transform become the main computational bottleneck. To address this issue, we propose to derive projections by linearly and randomly combining a smaller number of projections which are named bottleneck projections. We explain the usage of these projections by introducing Hierarchical Radon Transform (HRT) which is constructed by applying Radon Transform variants recursively. We then formulate the approach into a new metric between measures, named Hierarchical Sliced Wasserstein (HSW) distance. By proving the injectivity of HRT, we derive the metricity of HSW. Moreover, we investigate the theoretical properties of HSW including its connection to SW variants and its computational and sample complexities. Finally, we compare the computational cost and generative quality of HSW with the conventional SW on the task of deep generative modeling using various benchmark datasets including CIFAR10, CelebA, and Tiny ImageNet",

    "abstract": "We aim to train accurate denoising networks for smartphone/digital cameras from single noisy images. Downscaling is commonly used as a practical denoiser for low-resolution images. Based on this processing, we found that the pixel variance of the natural images is more robust to downscaling than the pixel variance of the camera noises. Intuitively, downscaling easily removes high-frequency noises than natural textures. To utilize this property, we can adopt noisy/clean image synthesis at low-resolution to train camera denoisers. On this basis, we propose a new solution pipeline -- NERDS that estimates camera noises and synthesizes noisy-clean image pairs from only noisy images. In particular, it first models the noise in raw-sensor images as a Poisson-Gaussian distribution, then estimates the noise parameters using the difference of pixel variances by downscaling. We formulate the noise estimation as a gradient-descent-based optimization problem through a reparametrization trick. We further introduce a new Image Signal Processor (ISP) estimation method that enables denoiser training in a human-readable RGB space by transforming the synthetic raw images to the style of a given RGB noisy image. The noise and ISP estimations utilize rich augmentation to synthesize image pairs for denoiser training.

Depending on the levels of details that we wish to capture, protein representations can be computed at different levels, \\emph{e.g.}, the amino acid, backbone, or all-atom levels. Importantly, there exist hierarchical relations among different levels. In this work, we propose to develop a novel hierarchical graph network, known as ProNet, to capture the relations. Our ProNet is very flexible and can be used to compute protein representations at different levels of granularity. By treating each amino acid as a node in graph modeling as well as harnessing the inherent hierarchies, our ProNet is more effective and efficient than existing methods. We also show that, given a base 3D graph network that is complete, our ProNet representations are also complete at all levels. Experimental results show that ProNet outperforms recent methods on most datasets. In addition, results indicate that different downstream tasks may require representations at different levels.

    "title": "RGI: robust GAN-inversion for mask-free image inpainting and unsupervised pixel-wise anomaly detection",
    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "Generative adversarial networks (GANs), trained on a large-scale image dataset, can be a good approximator of the natural image manifold. GAN-inversion, using a pre-trained generator as a deep generative prior, is a promising tool for image restoration under corruptions. However, the performance of GAN-inversion can be limited by a lack of robustness to unknown gross corruptions, i.e., the restored image might easily deviate from the ground truth. In this paper, we propose a Robust GAN-inversion (RGI) method with a provable robustness guarantee to achieve image restoration under unknown \\textit{gross} corruptions, where a small fraction of pixels are completely corrupted. Under mild assumptions, we show that the restored image and the identified corrupted region mask converge asymptotically to the ground truth. Moreover, we extend RGI to Relaxed-RGI (R-RGI) for generator fine-tuning to mitigate the gap between the GAN learned manifold and the true image manifold while avoiding trivial overfitting to the corrupted input image, which further improves the image restoration and corrupted region mask identification performance. The proposed RGI/R-RGI method unifies two important applications with state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance: (i) mask-free semantic inpainting, where the corruptions are unknown missing regions, the restored background can be used to restore the missing content. (ii) unsupervised pixel-wise anomaly detection, where the corruptions are unknown anomalous regions, the retrieved mask can be used as the anomalous region's segmentation mask",

    "title": "Coverage-centric Coreset Selection for High Pruning Rates",
    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "One-shot coreset selection aims to select a representative subset of the training data, given a pruning rate, that can later be used to train future models while retaining high accuracy. State-of-the-art coreset selection methods pick the highest importance examples based on an importance metric and are found to perform well at low pruning rates. However, at high pruning rates, they suffer from a catastrophic accuracy drop, performing worse than even random sampling. This paper explores the reasons behind this accuracy drop both theoretically and empirically. We first propose a novel metric to measure the coverage of a dataset on a specific distribution by extending the classical geometric set cover problem to a distribution cover problem. This metric helps explain why coresets selected by SOTA methods at high pruning rates perform poorly compared to random sampling because of worse data coverage. We then propose a novel one-shot coreset selection method, Coverage-centric Coreset Selection (CCS), that jointly considers overall data coverage upon a distribution as well as the importance of each example. We evaluate CCS on five datasets and show that, at high pruning rates (e.g., 90%), it achieves significantly better accuracy than previous SOTA methods (e.g., at least 19.56% higher on CIFAR10) as well as random selection (e.g., 7.04% higher on CIFAR10) and comparable accuracy at low pruning rates.

    "title": "ILA-DA: Improving Transferability of Intermediate Level Attack with Data Augmentation",
    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "Adversarial attack aims to generate deceptive inputs to fool a machine learning model. In deep learning, an adversarial input created for a specific neural network can also trick other neural networks. This intriguing property is known as black-box transferability of adversarial examples. To improve black-box transferability, a previously proposed method called Intermediate Level Attack (ILA) fine-tunes an adversarial example by maximizing its perturbation on an intermediate layer of the source model. Meanwhile, it has been shown that simple image transformations can also enhance attack transferability. Based on these two observations, we propose ILA-DA, which employs three novel augmentation techniques to enhance ILA. Specifically, we propose (1) an automated way to apply effective image transformations, (2) an efficient reverse adversarial update technique, and (3) an attack interpolation method to create more transferable adversarial examples. Shown by extensive experiments, ILA-DA greatly outperforms ILA and other state-of-the-art attacks by a large margin. On ImageNet, we attain an average attack success rate of 84.5%, which is 19.5% better than ILA and 4.7% better than the previous state-of-the-art across nine undefended models. For defended models, ILA-DA also leads existing attacks and provides further gains when incorporated into more advanced attack methods",

    "title": "Contrastive Alignment of Vision to Language Through Parameter-Efficient Transfer Learning",
    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "Contrastive vision-language models (e.g. CLIP) are typically created by updating all the parameters of a vision model and language model through contrastive training. Can such models be created by a small number of parameter updates to an already-trained language model and vision model? The literature describes techniques that can create vision-language models by updating a small number of parameters in a language model, but these require already aligned visual representations and are non-contrastive, hence unusable for latency-sensitive applications such as neural search. We explore the feasibility and benefits of parameter-efficient contrastive vision-language alignment through transfer learning: creating a model such as CLIP by minimally updating an already-trained vision and language model. We find that a minimal set of parameter updates ($<$7\\%) can achieve the same performance as full-model training, and updating specific components ($<$1\\% of parameters) can match 75\\% of full-model training. We describe a series of experiments: we show that existing knowledge is conserved more strongly in parameter-efficient training and that parameter-efficient scaling scales with model and dataset size. Where paired-image text data is scarce but strong multilingual language models exist (e.g. low resource languages), parameter-efficient training is even preferable to full-model training. Given a fixed compute budget, parameter-efficient training allows training larger models on the same hardware, achieving equivalent performance in less time. Parameter-efficient training hence constitutes an energy-efficient and effective training strategy for contrastive vision-language models that may be preferable to the full-model training paradigm for common use cases.

    "abstract": "In this paper, we study a novel inference paradigm, termed as schema inference, that learns to deductively infer the explainable predictions by rebuilding the prior deep neural network (DNN) forwarding scheme, guided by the prevalent philosophical cognitive concept of schema. We strive to reformulate the conventional model inference pipeline into a graph matching policy that associates the extracted visual concepts of an image with the pre-computed scene impression, by analogy with human reasoning mechanism via impression matching. To this end, we devise an elaborated architecture, termed as SchemaNet, as a dedicated instantiation of the proposed schema inference concept, that models both the visual semantics of input instances and the learned abstract imaginations of target categories as topological relational graphs. Meanwhile, to capture and leverage the compositional contributions of visual semantics in a global view, we also introduce a universal Feat2Graph scheme in SchemaNet to establish the relational graphs that contain abundant interaction information. Both the theoretical analysis and the experimental results on several benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed schema inference achieves encouraging performance and meanwhile yields a clear picture of the deductive process leading to the predictions.

    "title": "Distributionally Robust Recourse Action",

    "abstract": "A recourse action aims to explain a particular algorithmic decision by showing one specific way in which the instance could be modified to receive an alternate outcome. Existing recourse generation methods often assume that the machine learning model does not change over time. However, this assumption does not always hold in practice because of data distribution shifts, and in this case, the recourse action may become invalid. To redress this shortcoming, we propose the Distributionally Robust Recourse Action (DiRRAc) framework, which generates a recourse action that has high probability of being valid under a mixture of model shifts. We first formulate the robustified recourse setup as a min-max optimization problem, where the max problem is specified by Gelbrich distance over an ambiguity set around the distribution of model parameters. Then we suggest a projected gradient descent algorithm to find a robust recourse according to the min-max objective. We also show that our DiRRAc framework can be extended to hedge against the misspecification of the mixture weights. Numerical experiments with both synthetic and three real-world datasets demonstrate the benefits of our proposed framework over the state-of-the-art recourse methods, which generate robust recourses",

While this allows GNNs to learn features depending on the graph structure, for certain graph topologies it leads to inefficient information propagation and a problem known as oversquashing. This has recently been linked with the curvature and spectral gap of the graph. On the other hand, adding edges to the message-passing graph can lead to increasingly similar node representations and a problem known as oversmoothing. We propose a computationally efficient algorithm that prevents oversquashing by systematically adding edges to the graph based on spectral expansion. We combine this with a relational architecture, which lets the GNN preserve the original graph structure and provably prevents oversmoothing. We find experimentally that our algorithm outperforms existing graph rewiring methods in several graph classification tasks",

Our theory supports memorization both with and without permutation equivariance, utilizing positional encodings in the latter case.

Researchers have primarily focused on incorporating diverse structural inductive biases, e.g. attention or convolution, in modeling. The topic of inference suboptimality and an analysis of the NP from the optimization objective perspective has hardly been studied in earlier work. To fix this issue, we propose a surrogate objective of the target log-likelihood of the meta dataset within the expectation maximization framework. The resulting model, referred to as the Self-normalized Importance weighted Neural Process (SI-NP), can learn a more accurate functional prior and has an improvement guarantee concerning the target log-likelihood.

Instead of developing masked language modeling (MLM) and masked image modeling (MIM) independently, we propose to build joint masked vision and language modeling, where the masked signal of one modality is reconstructed with the help from another modality. This is motivated by the nature of image-text paired data that both of the image and the text convey almost the same information but in different formats. The masked signal reconstruction of one modality conditioned on another modality can also implicitly learn cross-modal alignment between language tokens and image patches. Our experiments on various V+L tasks show that the proposed method, along with common V+L alignment losses, not only achieves state-of-the-art performance by using a large amount of data but also outperforms the other competitors by a significant margin in the regimes of limited training data",

To mitigate these issues, we adapt the scheduled sampling algorithm to diffusion training. We conduct experiments on four markup datasets: formulas (LaTeX), table layouts (HTML), sheet music (LilyPond), and molecular images (SMILES).

    "abstract": "Forming a molecular candidate set that contains a wide range of potentially effective compounds is crucial to the success of drug discovery. While most databases and machine-learning-based generation models aim to optimize particular chemical properties, there is limited literature on how to properly measure the coverage of the chemical space by those candidates included or generated. This problem is challenging due to the lack of formal criteria to select good measures of the chemical space. In this paper, we propose a novel evaluation framework for measures of the chemical space based on two analyses: an axiomatic analysis with three intuitive axioms that a good measure should obey, and an empirical analysis on the correlation between a measure and a proxy gold standard. Using this framework, we are able to identify #Circles, a new measure of chemical space coverage, which is superior to existing measures both analytically and empirically. We further evaluate how well the existing databases and generation models cover the chemical space in terms of #Circles. The results suggest that many generation models fail to explore a larger space over existing databases, which leads to new opportunities for improving generation models by encouraging exploration",

This has been empirically observed in beam search decoding as output quality degrading with large beam sizes, and decoding strategies benefiting from heuristics such as length normalization and repetition-blocking. In this work, we introduce sequence likelihood calibration (SLiC) where the likelihood of model generated sequences are calibrated to better align with reference sequences in the model's latent space. With SLiC, decoding heuristics become unnecessary and decoding candidates' quality significantly improves regardless of the decoding method. Furthermore, SLiC shows no sign of diminishing returns with model scale, and presents alternative ways to improve quality with limited training and inference budgets.

It allows hospitals/institutions to train models with sufficient data while the data is kept private. To make sure the FL model is robust when facing heterogeneous data among FL clients, most efforts focus on personalizing models for clients. However, the latent relationships between clients' data are ignored. In this work, we focus on a special non-iid FL problem, called Domain-mixed FL, where each client's data distribution is assumed to be a mixture of several predefined domains. Recognizing the diversity of domains and the similarity within domains, we propose a novel method, FedDAR, which learns a domain shared representation and domain-wise personalized prediction heads in a decoupled manner.

While recent object-centric models can successfully decompose a scene into objects, modeling their dynamics effectively still remains a challenge. We address this problem by introducing SlotFormer -- a Transformer-based autoregressive model operating on learned object-centric representations. Given a video clip, our approach reasons over object features to model spatio-temporal relationships and predicts accurate future object states. In this paper, we successfully apply SlotFormer to perform video prediction on datasets with complex object interactions. Moreover, the unsupervised SlotFormer's dynamics model can be used to improve the performance on supervised downstream tasks, such as Visual Question Answering (VQA), and goal-conditioned planning. Compared to past works on dynamics modeling, our method achieves significantly better long-term synthesis of object dynamics, while retaining high quality visual generation. Besides, SlotFormer enables VQA models to reason about the future without object-level labels, even outperforming counterparts that use ground-truth annotations. Finally, we show its ability to serve as a world model for model-based planning, which is competitive with methods designed specifically for such tasks",

However, the alignment between these auxiliary objectives and the RL objective is often unclear. In this work, we propose a single objective which jointly optimizes a latent-space model and policy to achieve high returns while remaining self-consistent. This objective is a lower bound on expected returns. Unlike prior bounds for model-based RL on policy exploration or model guarantees, our bound is directly on the overall RL objective. We demonstrate that the resulting algorithm matches or improves the sample-efficiency of the best prior model-based and model-free RL methods.

However, the problem is highly challenging because closed-form equations lie in a complex combinatorial search space. Existing methods, ranging from heuristic search to reinforcement learning, fail to scale with the number of input variables. We make the observation that closed-form equations often have structural characteristics and invariances (e.g. the commutative law) that could be further exploited to build more effective symbolic regression solutions. Motivated by this observation, our key contribution is to leverage pre-trained deep generative models to capture the intrinsic regularities of equations, thereby providing a solid foundation for subsequent optimization steps. We show that our novel formalism unifies several prominent approaches of symbolic regression and offers a new perspective to justify and improve on the previous ad hoc designs, such as the usage of cross-entropy loss during pre-training. Specifically, we propose an instantiation of our framework, Deep Generative Symbolic Regression (DGSR).

Here we examine the relationship between deep architectures and their respective training regimes, with their corresponding selective prediction and uncertainty estimation performance. We consider some of the most popular estimation performance metrics previously proposed including AUROC, ECE, AURC as well as coverage for selective accuracy constraint. We present a novel and comprehensive study of selective prediction and the uncertainty estimation performance of 523 existing pretrained deep ImageNet classifiers that are available in popular repositories. We identify numerous and previously unknown factors that affect uncertainty estimation and examine the relationships between the different metrics. We find that distillation-based training regimes consistently yield better uncertainty estimations than other training schemes such as vanilla training, pretraining on a larger dataset and adversarial training. Moreover, we find a subset of ViT models that outperform any other models in terms of uncertainty estimation performance. For example, we discovered an unprecedented 99% top-1 selective accuracy on ImageNet at 47% coverage (and 95% top-1 accuracy at 80%) for a ViT model, whereas a competing EfficientNet-V2-XL cannot obtain these accuracy constraints at any level of coverage.

The key challenge is the estimation of the predictor-corrector term; a naive approach based on sample-average approximation may lead to non-convergence. We develop a general moving-average based method to estimate the predictor-corrector term and provide error bounds for the iterates, both in presence of pure and noisy access to the queries from the relevant derivatives of the loss function.

We investigate the problem of training models that are robust to shifts caused by changes in the distribution of class-priors or group-priors. The presence of skewed training priors can often lead to the models overfitting to spurious features. Unlike existing methods, which optimize for either the worst or the average performance over classes or groups, our work is motivated by the need for finer control over the robustness properties of the model. We present an extremely lightweight post-hoc approach that performs scaling adjustments to predictions from a pre-trained model, with the goal of minimizing a distributionally robust loss around a chosen target distribution. These adjustments are computed by solving a constrained optimization problem on a validation set and applied to the model during test time.

Specifically, inspired by direct sampling methods for inverse problems, the 1D boundary data in different frequencies are preprocessed by a partial differential equation-based feature map to yield 2D harmonic extensions as different input channels. Then, by introducing learnable non-local kernels, the direct sampling is recast to a modified attention mechanism. The new method achieves superior accuracy over its predecessors and contemporary operator learners and shows robustness to noises in benchmarks.

To alleviate such conflict, we randomly select partial inter-class prototypes to construct the margin-based softmax loss. To further enhance the low-dimensional feature representation, we randomly select partial feature dimensions when calculating the similarities between embeddings and class-wise prototypes. The dual random partial selections are with respect to the class dimension and the feature dimension of the prototype matrix, making the classification conflict-robust and the feature embedding compact. Our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art unsupervised and supervised image retrieval approaches on multiple benchmarks. The code and pre-trained models are released to facilitate future research \\url{https://github.com/deepglint/unicom}",

    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "Diffusion probabilistic models have quickly become a major approach for generative modeling of images, 3D geometry, video and other domains. However, to adapt diffusion generative modeling to these domains the denoising network needs to be carefully designed for each domain independently, oftentimes under the assumption that data lives in a Euclidean grid. In this paper we introduce Diffusion Probabilistic Fields (DPF), a diffusion model that can learn distributions over continuous functions defined over metric spaces, commonly known as fields. We extend the formulation of diffusion probabilistic models to deal with this field parametrization in an explicit way, enabling us to define an end-to-end learning algorithm that side-steps the requirement of representing fields with latent vectors as in previous approaches (Dupont et al., 2022a; Du et al., 2021). We empirically show that, while using the same denoising network, DPF effectively deals with different modalities like 2D images and 3D geometry, in addition to modeling distributions over fields defined on non-Euclidean metric spaces",

    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "The ability to ensure that a classifier gives reliable confidence scores is essential to ensure informed decision-making. To this end, recent work has focused on miscalibration, i.e., the over or under confidence of model scores. Yet calibration is not enough: even a perfectly calibrated classifier with the best possible accuracy can have confidence scores that are far from the true posterior probabilities. This is due to the grouping loss, created by samples with the same confidence scores but different true posterior probabilities. Proper scoring rule theory shows that given the calibration loss, the missing piece to characterize individual errors is the grouping loss. While there are many estimators of the calibration loss, none exists for the grouping loss in standard settings. Here, we propose an estimator to approximate the grouping loss. We show that modern neural network architectures in vision and NLP exhibit grouping loss, notably in distribution shifts settings, which highlights the importance of pre-production validation",

The framework mitigates the challenges that arise in both pure offline and online RL settings, allowing for the design of simple and highly effective algorithms, in both theory and practice. We demonstrate these advantages by adapting the classical Q learning/iteration algorithm to the hybrid setting, which we call Hybrid Q-Learning or Hy-Q. In our theoretical results, we prove that the algorithm is both computationally and statistically efficient whenever the offline dataset supports a high-quality policy and the environment has bounded bilinear rank. Notably, we require no assumptions on the coverage provided by the initial distribution, in contrast with guarantees for policy gradient/iteration methods. In our experimental results, we show that Hy-Q with neural network function approximation outperforms state-of-the-art online, offline, and hybrid RL baselines on challenging benchmarks, including Montezuma's Revenge",

    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "Prompt tuning approaches, which learn task-specific soft prompts for a downstream task conditioning on frozen pre-trained models, have attracted growing interest due to its parameter efficiency. With large language models and sufficient training data, prompt tuning performs comparably to full-model tuning. However, with limited training samples in few-shot settings, prompt tuning fails to match the performance of full-model fine-tuning. In this work, we focus on improving the few-shot performance of prompt tuning by transferring knowledge from soft prompts of source tasks with abundant training samples. Recognizing the good generalization capabilities of ensemble methods in low-data regime, we first experiment and show that a simple ensemble of model predictions based on different source prompts, outperforms existing multi-prompt knowledge transfer approaches such as source prompt fusion in the few-shot setting. Motivated by this observation, we further investigate model ensembles and propose Sample-specific Ensemble of Source Models (SESoM). SESoM learns to adjust the contribution of each source model for each target sample separately when ensembling source model outputs. Through this way, SESoM inherits the superior generalization of ensemble methods and simultaneously captures the sample-specific competence of each source prompt. We conduct experiments across a diverse set of eight NLP tasks using models of different scales (T5-\\{base, large, XL\\}) and find that SESoM consistently outperforms the existing models of the same as well as larger parametric scale by a large margin",

    "abstract": "Despite the great success achieved in instructional action understanding by deep learning and mountainous data, deploying trained models to the unseen environment still remains a great challenge, since it requires strong generalizability of models from in-distribution training data to out-of-distribution (OOD) data. In this paper, we introduce a benchmark, named GAIN, to analyze the GeneralizAbility of INstructional action understanding models. In GAIN, we reassemble steps of existing instructional video training datasets to construct the OOD tasks and then collect the corresponding videos. We evaluate the generalizability of models trained on in-distribution datasets with the performance on OOD videos and observe a significant performance drop. We further propose a simple yet effective approach, which cuts off the excessive contextual dependency of action steps by performing causal inference, to provide a potential direction for enhancing the OOD generalizability. In the experiments, we show that this simple approach can improve several baselines on both instructional action segmentation and detection tasks. We expect the introduction of the GAIN dataset will promote future in-depth research on the generalization of instructional video understanding",

    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "The vast amount of health data has been continuously collected for each patient, providing opportunities to support diverse healthcare predictive tasks such as seizure detection and hospitalization prediction. Existing models are mostly trained on other patients' data and evaluated on new patients. Many of them might suffer from poor generalizability. One key reason can be overfitting due to the unique information related to patient identities and their data collection environments, referred to as patient covariates in the paper. These patient covariates usually do not contribute to predicting the targets but are often difficult to remove. As a result, they can bias the model training process and impede generalization. In healthcare applications, most existing domain generalization methods assume a small number of domains. In this paper, considering the diversity of patient covariates, we propose a new setting by treating each patient as a separate domain (leading to many domains). We develop a new domain generalization method ManyDG, that can scale to such many-domain problems. Our method identifies the patient do- main covariates by mutual reconstruction, and removes them via an orthogonal projection step. Extensive experiments show that ManyDG can boost the generalization performance on multiple real-world healthcare tasks (e.g., 3.7% Jaccard improvements on MIMIC drug recommendation) and support realistic but challenging settings such as insufficient data and continuous learning.

Previous methods either generate logical forms that can be executed over KBs to obtain final answers or predict answers directly. Empirical results show that the former often produces more accurate answers, but it suffers from non-execution issues due to potential syntactic and semantic errors in the generated logical forms. In this work, we propose a novel framework DecAF that jointly generates both logical forms and direct answers, and then combines the merits of them to get the final answers. Moreover, different from most of the previous methods, DecAF is based on simple free-text retrieval without relying on any entity linking tools --- this simplification eases its adaptation to different datasets.

In addition, most of the voice synthesis models still require a large number of audio data paired with annotated labels (e.g., text transcription and music score) for training. To this end, we propose a unified framework of synthesizing and manipulating voice signals from analysis features, dubbed NANSY++. The backbone network of NANSY++ is trained in a self-supervised manner that does not require any annotations paired with audio. After training the backbone network, we efficiently tackle four voice applications - i.e. voice conversion, text-to-speech, singing voice synthesis, and voice designing - by partially modeling the analysis features required for each task. Extensive experiments show that the proposed framework offers competitive advantages such as controllability, data efficiency, and fast training convergence, while providing high quality synthesis.

Attention modules tend to underline not only the target object but also the common co-occurring context that the module thinks helpful in the training. The problem is rooted in the confounding effect of the context leading to incorrect causalities between objects and predictions, which is further exacerbated by visual attention. In this paper, to learn causal object features robust for contextual bias, we propose a novel attention module named Interventional Dual Attention (IDA) for visual recognition. Specifically, IDA adopts two attention layers with multiple sampling intervention, which compensates the attention against the confounder context. Note that our method is model-agnostic and thus can be implemented on various backbones.

    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "In recent years, single-objective reinforcement learning (SORL) algorithms have received a significant amount of attention and seen some strong results. However, it is generally recognized that many practical problems have intrinsic multi-objective properties that cannot be easily handled by SORL algorithms. Although there have been many multi-objective reinforcement learning (MORL) algorithms proposed, there has been little recent exploration of the fundamental properties of the spaces we are learning in. In this paper, we perform a rigorous analysis of policy induced value functions and use the insights to distinguish three views of Pareto optimality. The results imply the convexity of the induced value function's range for stationary policies and suggest that any point of its Pareto front can be achieved by training a policy using linear scalarization (LS). We show the problem that leads to the suboptimal performance of LS can be solved by adding strongly concave terms to the immediate rewards, which motivates us to propose a new vector reward-based Q-learning algorithm, CAPQL. Combined with an actor-critic formulation, our algorithm achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple MuJoCo tasks in the preference agnostic setting. Furthermore, we empirically show that, in contrast to other LS-based algorithms, our approach is significantly more stable, achieving similar results across various random seeds",

In this paper, we propose a complementary family of attacks that leave the model intact and manipulate SHAP explanations using stealthily biased sampling of the data points used to approximate expectations w.r.t the background distribution. In the context of fairness audit, we show that our attack can reduce the importance of a sensitive feature when explaining the difference in outcomes between groups while remaining undetected. More precisely, experiments performed on real-world datasets showed that our attack could yield up to a 90\\% relative decrease in amplitude of the sensitive feature attribution.

    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "Finding equilibria via gradient play in competitive multi-agent games has been attracting a growing amount of attention in recent years, with emphasis on designing efficient strategies where the agents operate in a decentralized and symmetric manner with guaranteed convergence. While significant efforts have been made in understanding zero-sum two-player matrix games, the performance in zero-sum multi-agent games remains inadequately explored, especially in the presence of delayed feedbacks, leaving the scalability and resiliency of gradient play open to questions. In this paper, we make progress by studying asynchronous gradient plays in zero-sum polymatrix games under delayed feedbacks. We first establish that the last iterate of entropy-regularized optimistic multiplicative weight updates (OMWU) method converges linearly to the quantal response equilibrium (QRE), the solution concept under bounded rationality, in the absence of delays. The linear convergence continues to hold even when the feedbacks are randomly delayed under mild statistical assumptions, albeit at a slower rate. Moving beyond random delays, we further demonstrate entropy-regularized OMWU with two-timescale learning rates enjoys faster last-iterate convergence under fixed delays, and continues to converge provably even when the delays are arbitrarily bounded. Our methods also lead to finite-time guarantees to approximate the Nash equilibrium (NE) by moderating the amount of regularization. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first that aims to understand asynchronous gradient play in zero-sum polymatrix games under a wide range of delay assumptions",

The core of 3DiM is an image-to-image diffusion model -- 3DiM takes a single reference view and their poses as inputs, and generates a novel view via diffusion. 3DiM can then generate a full 3D consistent scene following our novel stochastic conditioning sampler: the output frames of the scene are generated autoregressively, and during the reverse diffusion process of each individual frame, we select a random conditioning frame from the set of previous frames at each denoising step. We demonstrate that stochastic conditioning yields much more 3D consistent results compared to the naive sampling process which only conditions on a single previous frame. We compare 3DiMs to prior work on the SRN ShapeNet dataset, demonstrating that 3DiM's generated videos from a single view achieve much higher fidelity while being approximately 3D consistent. We also introduce a new evaluation methodology, 3D consistency scoring, to measure the 3D consistency of a generated object by training a neural field on the model's output views. 3DiMs are geometry free, do not rely on hyper-networks or test-time optimization for novel view synthesis, and allow a single model to easily scale to a large number of scenes",

In addition, we introduce an inverse query algorithm to freely manipulate any specified 3D object shape in the learned scene representation. Notably, our manipulation algorithm can explicitly tackle key issues such as object collisions and visual occlusions. Our method, called DM-NeRF, is among the first to simultaneously reconstruct, decompose, manipulate and render complex 3D scenes in a single pipeline.

The proposal of $\\beta$-VAEs breaks this interpretation and generalizes VAEs to application domains beyond generative modeling (e.g., representation learning, clustering, or lossy data compression) by introducing an objective function that allows practitioners to trade off between the information content (\"bit rate\") of the latent representation and the distortion of reconstructed data. In this paper, we reconsider this rate/distortion trade-off in the context of hierarchical VAEs, i.e., VAEs with more than one layer of latent variables. We propose a method to control each layer's contribution to the rate independently. We identify the most general class of inference models to which our proposed method is applicable, and we derive theoretical bounds on the performance of downstream tasks as functions of the individual layers' rates.

    "abstract": "Most approaches for self-supervised learning (SSL) are optimised on curated balanced datasets, e.g. ImageNet, despite the fact that natural data usually exhibits long-tail distributions. In this paper, we analyse the behaviour of one of the most popular variants of SSL, i.e. contrastive methods, on imbalanced data. In particular, we investigate the role of the temperature parameter $\\tau$ in the contrastive loss, by analysing the loss through the lens of average distance maximisation, and find that a large $\\tau$ emphasises group-wise discrimination, whereas a small $\\tau$ leads to a higher degree of instance discrimination. While $\\tau$ has thus far been treated exclusively as a constant hyperparameter, in this work, we propose to employ a dynamic $\\tau$ and show that a simple cosine schedule can yield significant improvements in the learnt representations. Such a schedule results in a constant `task switching' between an emphasis on instance discrimination and group-wise discrimination and thereby ensures that the model learns both group-wise features, as well as instance-specific details. Since frequent classes benefit from the former, while infrequent classes require the latter, we find this method to consistently improve separation between the classes in long-tail data without any additional computational cost",

    "abstract": "Multi-view projection methods have demonstrated promising performance on 3D understanding tasks like 3D classification and segmentation. However, it remains unclear how to combine such multi-view methods with the widely available 3D point clouds. Previous methods use unlearned heuristics to combine features at the point level. To this end, we introduce the concept of the multi-view point cloud (Voint cloud), representing each 3D point as a set of features extracted from several view-points. This novel 3D Voint cloud representation combines the compactness of 3D point cloud representation with the natural view-awareness of multi-view representation. Naturally, we can equip this new representation with convolutional and pooling operations. We deploy a Voint neural network (VointNet) to learn representations in the Voint space. Our novel representation achieves state-of-the-art performance on 3D classification, shape retrieval, and robust 3D part segmentation on standard benchmarks ( ScanObjectNN, ShapeNet Core55, and ShapeNet Parts). Further analysis shows that VointNet improves the robustness to occlusion compared to other methods",

    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "A locality-sensitive hash (or LSH) is a function that can efficiently map dataset points into a latent space while preserving pairwise distances. Such LSH functions have been used in approximate nearest-neighbor search (ANNS) in the following classic way, which we call classic hash clustering (CHC): first, the dataset points are hashed into a low-dimensional binary space using the LSH function; then, the points are clustered by these hash values. Upon receiving a query, its nearest neighbors are sought within its hash-cluster and nearby hash-clusters (i.e., multi-probe). However, CHC mandates a low-dimensional latent space for the LSH function, which distorts distances from the (high-dimensional) original real space; this results in inferior recall. This is often mitigated through using multiple hash tables at additional storage and memory costs. In this paper, we introduce a better way of using LSH functions for ANNS. Our method, called the Polar Code Nearest-Neighbor (PCNN) algorithm, uses modern error-correcting codes (specifically polar codes) to maintain a manageable number of clusters inside a high-dimensional latent space. Allowing the LSH function to embed into this high-dimensional latent space results in higher recall, as the embedding faithfully captures distances in the original space. The crux of PCNN is using polar codes for probing: we present a multi-probe scheme for PCNN which uses efficient list-decoding methods for polar codes, with time complexity independent of the dataset size. Fixing the choice of LSH, experiment results demonstrate significant performance gains of PCNN over CHC; in particular, PCNN with a single table outperforms CHC with multiple tables, obviating the need for large memory and storage",

    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "In many scenarios, decision-makers must commit to long-term actions until their resolution before receiving the payoff of said actions, and usually, staying committed to such actions incurs continual costs. For instance, in healthcare, a newly-discovered treatment cannot be marketed to patients until a clinical trial is conducted, which both requires time and is also costly. Of course in such scenarios, not all commitments eventually pay off. For instance, a clinical trial might end up failing to show efficacy. Given the time pressure created by the continual cost of keeping a commitment, we aim to answer: When should a decision-maker break a commitment that is likely to fail—either to make an alternative commitment or to make no further commitments at all? First, we formulate this question as a new type of optimal stopping/switching problem called the optimal commitment problem (OCP). Then, we theoretically analyze OCP, and based on the insights we gain, propose a practical algorithm for solving it. Finally, we empirically evaluate the performance of our algorithm in running clinical trials with subpopulation selection",

Some pioneer works have achieved encouraging results on RGB-D SLAM. In this paper, we present a dense RGB SLAM method with neural implicit map representation. To reach this challenging goal without depth input, we introduce a hierarchical feature volume to facilitate the implicit map decoder. This design effectively fuses shape cues across different scales to facilitate map reconstruction. Our method simultaneously solves the camera motion and the neural implicit map by matching the rendered and input video frames. To facilitate optimization, we further propose a photometric warping loss in the spirit of multi-view stereo to better constrain the camera pose and scene geometry. We evaluate our method on commonly used benchmarks and compare it with modern RGB and RGB-D SLAM systems. Our method achieves favorable results than previous methods and even surpasses some recent RGB-D SLAM methods.The code is at poptree.github.io/DIM-SLAM/",

    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "Monocular scene reconstruction from posed images is challenging due to the complexity of a large environment. Recent volumetric methods learn to directly predict the TSDF volume and have demonstrated promising results in this task. However, most methods focus on how to extract and fuse the 2D features to a 3D feature volume, but none of them improve the way how the 3D volume is aggregated. In this work, we propose an SDF transformer network, which replaces the role of 3D CNN for better 3D feature aggregation. To reduce the explosive computation complexity of the 3D multi-head attention, we propose a sparse window attention module, where the attention is only calculated between the non-empty voxels within a local window. Then a top-down-bottom-up 3D attention network is built for 3D feature aggregation, where a dilate-attention structure is proposed to prevent geometry degeneration, and two global modules are employed to equip with global receptive fields. The experiments on multiple datasets show that this 3D transformer network generates a more accurate and complete reconstruction, which outperforms previous methods by a large margin. Remarkably, the mesh accuracy is improved by 41.8%, and the mesh completeness is improved by 25.3% on the ScanNet dataset. The code of our method will be made public",

Recently, various works have been presented to tackle the problem of inferring those relationships from the system trajectories via deep neural networks, but most of the studies assume binary or discrete types of interactions for simplicity. In the real world, the interaction kernels often involve continuous interaction strengths, which cannot be accurately approximated by discrete relations. In this work, we propose the relational attentive inference network (RAIN) to infer continuously weighted interaction graphs without any ground-truth interaction strengths. Our model employs a novel pairwise attention (PA) mechanism to refine the trajectory representations and a graph transformer to extract heterogeneous interaction weights for each pair of agents. We show that our RAIN model with the PA mechanism accurately infers continuous interaction strengths for simulated physical systems in an unsupervised manner. Further, RAIN with PA successfully predicts trajectories from motion capture data with an interpretable interaction graph, demonstrating the virtue of modeling unknown dynamics with continuous weights",

Motivated from entirely different viewpoints, their loss functions appear to be unrelated. In practice, they yield strongly differing embeddings and can suggest conflicting interpretations of the same data. The fundamental reasons for this and, more generally, the exact relationship between $t$-SNE and UMAP have remained unclear. In this work, we uncover their conceptual connection via a new insight into contrastive learning methods. Noise-contrastive estimation can be used to optimize $t$-SNE, while UMAP relies on negative sampling, another contrastive method. We find the precise relationship between these two contrastive methods, and provide a mathematical characterization of the distortion introduced by negative sampling. Visually, this distortion results in UMAP generating more compact embeddings with tighter clusters compared to $t$-SNE. We exploit this new conceptual connection to propose and implement a generalization of negative sampling, allowing us to interpolate between (and even extrapolate beyond) $t$-SNE and UMAP and their respective embeddings. Moving along this spectrum of embeddings leads to a trade-off between discrete / local and continuous / global structures, mitigating the risk of over-interpreting ostensible features of any single embedding.

    "title": "D4AM: A General Denoising Framework for Downstream Acoustic Models",
    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "The performance of acoustic models degrades notably in noisy environments. Speech enhancement (SE) can be used as a front-end strategy to aid automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems. However, existing training objectives of SE methods are not fully effective at integrating speech-text and noise-clean paired data for training toward unseen ASR systems. In this study, we propose a general denoising framework, D4AM, for various downstream acoustic models. Our framework fine-tunes the SE model with the backward gradient according to a specific acoustic model and the corresponding classification objective. In addition, our method aims to consider the regression objective as an auxiliary loss to make the SE model generalize to other unseen acoustic models. To jointly train an SE unit with regression and classification objectives, D4AM uses an adjustment scheme to directly estimate suitable weighting coefficients rather than undergoing a grid search process with additional training costs. The adjustment scheme consists of two parts: gradient calibration and regression objective weighting. The experimental results show that D4AM can consistently and effectively provide improvements to various unseen acoustic models and outperforms other combination setups. Specifically, when evaluated on the Google ASR API with real noisy data completely unseen during SE training, D4AM achieves a relative WER reduction of 24.65% compared with the direct feeding of noisy input. To our knowledge, this is the first work that deploys an effective combination scheme of regression (denoising) and classification (ASR) objectives to derive a general pre-processor applicable to various unseen ASR systems.

    "title": "Adaptive Budget Allocation for Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning",
    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "Fine-tuning large pre-trained language models on downstream tasks has become an important paradigm in NLP. However, common practice fine-tunes all of the parameters in a pre-trained model, which becomes prohibitive when a large number of downstream tasks are present. Therefore, many fine-tuning methods are proposed to learn incremental updates of pre-trained weights in a parameter efficient way, e.g., low-rank increments. These methods often evenly distribute the budget of incremental updates across all pre-trained weight matrices, and overlook the varying importance of different weight parameters. As a consequence, the fine-tuning performance is suboptimal. To bridge this gap, we propose AdaLoRA, which adaptively allocates the parameter budget among weight matrices according to their importance score. In particular, AdaLoRA parameterizes the incremental updates in the form of singular value decomposition. Such a novel approach allows us to effectively prune the singular values of unimportant updates, which is essentially to reduce their parameter budget but circumvent intensive exact SVD computations. We conduct extensive experiments with several pre-trained models on natural language processing, question answering, and natural language generation to validate the effectiveness of AdaLoRA.

    "title": "Generalize Learned Heuristics to Solve Large-scale Vehicle Routing Problems in Real-time",
    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "Large-scale Vehicle Routing Problems (VRPs) are widely used in logistics, transportation, supply chain, and robotic systems. Recently, data-driven VRP heuristics are proposed to generate real-time VRP solutions with up to 100 nodes. Despite this progress, current heuristics for large-scale VRPs still face three major challenges: 1) Difficulty in generalizing the heuristics learned on small-scale VRPs to large-scale VRPs without retraining; 2) Challenge in generating real-time solutions for large-scale VRPs; 3) Difficulty in embedding global constraints into learned heuristics. We contribute in the three directions: We propose a Two-stage Divide Method (TAM) to generate sub-route sequence rather than node sequence for generalizing the heuristics learned on small-scale VRPs to solve large-scale VRPs in real-time. A two-step reinforcement learning method with new reward and padding techniques is proposed to train our TAM. A global mask function is proposed to keep the global constraints satisfied when dividing a large-scale VRP into several small-scale Traveling Salesman Problems (TSPs). As result, we can solve the small-scale TSPs in parallel quickly. The experiments on synthetic and real-world large-scale VRPs show our method could generalize the learned heuristics trained on datasets of VRP 100 to solve VRPs with over 5000 nodes in real-time while keeping the solution quality better than data-driven heuristics and competitive with traditional heuristics",

    "title": "Towards the Generalization of Contrastive Self-Supervised Learning",
    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "Recently, self-supervised learning has attracted great attention, since it only requires unlabeled data for model training. Contrastive learning is one popular method for self-supervised learning and has achieved promising empirical performance. However, the theoretical understanding of its generalization ability is still limited. To this end, we define a kind of $(\\sigma,\\delta)$-measure to mathematically quantify the data augmentation, and then provide an upper bound of the downstream classification error rate based on the measure. It reveals that the generalization ability of contrastive self-supervised learning is related to three key factors: alignment of positive samples, divergence of class centers, and concentration of augmented data. The first two factors are properties of learned representations, while the third one is determined by pre-defined data augmentation. We further investigate two canonical contrastive losses, InfoNCE and cross-correlation, to show how they provably achieve the first two factors. Moreover, we conduct experiments to study the third factor, and observe a strong correlation between downstream performance and the concentration of augmented data",

    "abstract": "Unsupervised contrastive learning for indoor-scene point clouds has achieved great successes. However, unsupervised representation learning on outdoor-scene point clouds remains challenging because previous methods need to reconstruct the whole scene and capture partial views for the contrastive objective. This is infeasible in outdoor scenes with moving objects, obstacles, and sensors. In this paper, we propose CO3, namely {Co}operative {Co}ntrastive Learning and {Co}ntextual Shape Prediction, to learn 3D representation for outdoor-scene point clouds in an unsupervised manner. CO3 has several merits compared to existing methods. (1) It utilizes LiDAR point clouds from vehicle-side and infrastructure-side to build views that differ enough but meanwhile maintain common semantic information for contrastive learning, which are more appropriate than views built by previous methods. (2) Alongside the contrastive objective, we propose contextual shape prediction to bring more task-relevant information for unsupervised 3D point cloud representation learning and we also provide a theoretical analysis for this pre-training goal. (3) As compared to previous methods, representation learned by CO3 is able to be transferred to different outdoor scene dataset collected by different type of LiDAR sensors. (4) CO3 improves current state-of-the-art methods on Once, KITTI and NuScenes datasets by up to 2.58 mAP in 3D object detection task and 3.54 mIoU in LiDAR semantic segmentation task.

    "abstract": "Unsupervised text-to-speech (TTS) aims to train TTS models for a specific language without any paired speech-text training data in that language. Existing methods either use speech and corresponding pseudo text generated by an unsupervised automatic speech recognition (ASR) model as training data, or employ the back-translation technique. Though effective, they suffer from low robustness to low-quality data and heavy dependence on the lexicon of a language that is sometimes unavailable, leading to difficulty in convergence, especially in low-resource language scenarios. In this work, we introduce a bag of tricks to enable effective unsupervised TTS. Specifically, 1) we carefully design a voice conversion model to normalize the variable and noisy information in the low-quality speech data while preserving the pronunciation information; 2) we employ the non-autoregressive TTS model to overcome the robustness issue; and 3) we explore several tricks applied in back-translation, including curriculum learning, length augmentation and auxiliary supervised loss to stabilize the back-translation and improve its effectiveness. Through experiments, it has been demonstrated that our method achieves better intelligibility and audio quality than all previous methods, and that these tricks are very essential to the performance gain",

    "abstract": "Federated learning (FL) is an emerging distributed machine learning framework which jointly trains a global model via a large number of local devices with data privacy protections. Its performance suffers from the non-vanishing biases introduced by the local inconsistent optimal and the rugged client-drifts by the local over-fitting. In this paper, we propose a novel and practical method, FedSpeed, to alleviate the negative impacts posed by these problems. Concretely, FedSpeed applies the prox-correction term on the current local updates to efficiently reduce the biases introduced by the prox-term, a necessary regularizer to maintain the strong local consistency. Furthermore, FedSpeed merges the vanilla stochastic gradient with a perturbation computed from an extra gradient ascent step in the neighborhood, thereby alleviating the issue of local over-fitting. Our theoretical analysis indicates that the convergence rate is related to both the communication rounds $T$ and local intervals $K$ with a tighter upper bound $\\mathcal{O}(\\frac{1}{T})$ if $K=\\mathcal{O}(T)$. Moreover, we conduct extensive experiments on the real-world dataset to demonstrate the efficiency of our proposed FedSpeed, which converges significantly faster and achieves the state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on the general FL experimental settings than several baselines including FedAvg, FedProx, FedCM, FedAdam, SCAFFOLD, FedDyn, FedADMM, etc",

    "abstract": "Modern studies in radiograph representation learning (R$^2$L) rely on either self-supervision to encode invariant semantics or associated radiology reports to incorporate medical expertise, while the complementarity between them is barely noticed. To explore this, we formulate the self- and report-completion as two complementary objectives and present a unified framework based on masked record modeling (MRM). In practice, MRM reconstructs masked image patches and masked report tokens following a multi-task scheme to learn knowledge-enhanced semantic representations. With MRM pre-training, we obtain pre-trained models that can be well transferred to various radiography tasks. Specifically, we find that MRM offers superior performance in label-efficient fine-tuning. For instance, MRM achieves 88.5% mean AUC on CheXpert using 1% labeled data, outperforming previous R$^2$L methods with 100% labels. On NIH ChestX-ray, MRM outperforms the best performing counterpart by about 3% under small labeling ratios.

    "title": "Instance-wise Batch Label Restoration via Gradients in Federated Learning",
    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "Gradient inversion attacks have posed a serious threat to the privacy of federated learning. The attacks search for the optimal pair of input and label best matching the shared gradients and the search space of the attacks can be reduced by pre-restoring labels. Recently, label restoration technique allows for the extraction of labels from gradients analytically, but even the state-of-the-art remains limited to identify the presence of categories (i.e., the class-wise label restoration). This work considers the more real-world settings, where there are multiple instances of each class in a training batch. An analytic method is proposed to perform instance-wise batch label restoration from only the gradient of the final layer. On the basis of the approximate recovered class-wise embeddings and post-softmax probabilities, we establish linear equations of the gradients, probabilities and labels to derive the Number of Instances (NoI) per class by the Moore-Penrose pseudoinverse algorithm. Our experimental evaluations reach over 99% Label existence Accuracy (LeAcc) and exceed 96% Label number Accuracy (LnAcc) in most cases on three image datasets and four classification models. The two metrics are used to evaluate class-wise and instance-wise label restoration accuracy, respectively. And the recovery is made feasible even with a batch size of 4096 and partially negative activations (e.g., Leaky ReLU and Swish). Furthermore, we demonstrate that our method facilitates the existing gradient inversion attacks by exploiting the recovered labels, with an increase of 6-7 in PSNR on both MNIST and CIFAR100.

    "abstract": "The well-designed structures in neural networks reflect the prior knowledge incorporated into the models. However, though different models have various priors, we are used to training them with model-agnostic optimizers such as SGD. In this paper, we propose to incorporate model-specific prior knowledge into optimizers by modifying the gradients according to a set of model-specific hyper-parameters. Such a methodology is referred to as Gradient Re-parameterization, and the optimizers are named RepOptimizers. For the extreme simplicity of model structure, we focus on a VGG-style plain model and showcase that such a simple model trained with a RepOptimizer, which is referred to as RepOpt-VGG, performs on par with or better than the recent well-designed models. From a practical perspective, RepOpt-VGG is a favorable base model because of its simple structure, high inference speed and training efficiency. Compared to Structural Re-parameterization, which adds priors into models via constructing extra training-time structures, RepOptimizers require no extra forward/backward computations and solve the problem of quantization.

To mitigate this, we propose Knowledge-exploited Auto-encoder for Protein (KeAP), which performs token-level knowledge graph exploration for protein representation learning. In practice, non-masked amino acids iteratively query the associated knowledge tokens to extract and integrate helpful information for restoring masked amino acids via attention. We show that KeAP can consistently outperform the previous counterpart on 9 representative downstream applications, sometimes surpassing it by large margins.

Further, we propose a novel, Provable Data Sharing algorithm (PDS) to utilize such reward-free data for offline RL. PDS uses additional penalties on the reward function learned from labeled data to prevent overestimation, ensuring a conservative algorithm. Our results on various offline RL tasks demonstrate that PDS significantly improves the performance of offline RL algorithms with reward-free data. Overall, our work provides a promising approach to leveraging the benefits of unlabeled data in offline RL while maintaining theoretical guarantees.

Motivated by an observation that the sentences in parallel documents are approximately in the same order, which is universal across languages, we propose to model this sequential sentence relation to facilitate cross-lingual representation learning. Specifically, we propose a multilingual PLM called masked sentence model (MSM), which consists of a sentence encoder to generate the sentence representations, and a document encoder applied to a sequence of sentence vectors from a document. The document encoder is shared for all languages to model the universal sequential sentence relation across languages. To train the model, we propose a masked sentence prediction task, which masks and predicts the sentence vector via a hierarchical contrastive loss with sampled negatives. Comprehensive experiments on four cross-lingual retrieval tasks show MSM significantly outperforms existing advanced pre-training models, demonstrating the effectiveness and stronger cross-lingual retrieval capabilities of our approach",

    "title": "DepthFL : Depthwise Federated Learning for Heterogeneous Clients",
    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "Federated learning is for training a global model without collecting private local data from clients. As they repeatedly need to upload locally-updated weights or gradients instead, clients require both computation and communication resources enough to participate in learning, but in reality their resources are heterogeneous. To enable resource-constrained clients to train smaller local models, width scaling techniques have been used, which reduces the channels of a global model. Unfortunately, width scaling suffers from heterogeneity of local models when averaging them, leading to a lower accuracy than when simply excluding resource-constrained clients from training. This paper proposes a new approach based on depth scaling called DepthFL. DepthFL defines local models of different depths by pruning the deepest layers off the global model, and allocates them to clients depending on their available resources. Since many clients do not have enough resources to train deep local models, this would make deep layers partially-trained with insufficient data, unlike shallow layers that are fully trained. DepthFL alleviates this problem by mutual self-distillation of knowledge among the classifiers of various depths within a local model. Our experiments show that depth-scaled local models build a global model better than width-scaled ones, and that self-distillation is highly effective in training data-insufficient deep layers",

MIM recently dominates this line of research with state-of-the-art performance on vision Transformers (ViTs), where the core is to enhance the patch-level visual context capturing of the network via denoising auto-encoding mechanism. Rather than tailoring image tokenizers with extra training stages as in previous works, we unleash the great potential of contrastive learning on de- noising auto-encoding and introduce a pure MIM method, ConMIM, to produce simple intra-image inter-patch contrastive constraints as the sole learning objectives for masked patch prediction. We further strengthen the denoising mechanism with asymmetric designs, including image perturbations and model progress rates, to improve the network pre-training. ConMIM-pretrained models with various scales achieve competitive results on downstream image classification, semantic segmentation, object detection, and instance segmentation tasks, e.g., on ImageNet-1K classification, we achieve 83.9% top-1 accuracy with ViT-Small and 85.3% with ViT-Base without extra data for pre-training.

To alleviate this, we introduce GoBigger, a scalable platform for cooperative-competition multi-agent interactive simulation. GoBigger is an enhanced environment for the Agar-like game, enabling the simulation of multiple scales of agent intra-team cooperation and inter-team competition. Compared with existing multi-agent simulation environments, our platform supports multi-team games with more than two teams simultaneously, which dramatically expands the diversity of agent cooperation and competition, and can more effectively simulate the swarm intelligent agent behavior.

While self-supervised representation learning has achieved impressive progress, it still requires a second stage of finetuning on labeled data. On the other hand, models pre-trained with large-scale text supervision (e.g., CLIP) have enabled zero-shot transfer to downstream image classification tasks. However, the zero-shot performance of CLIP-like models are often insufficient for real-world adoption. In this paper, we aim to leverage the abundant unlabeled data from a target domain to improve the performance of a pre-trained zero-shot classifier, by unsupervised finetuning of the pre-trained model. We propose Masked Unsupervised Self-Training (MUST), a new approach which leverages two different and complimentary sources of training signals: pseudo-labels and raw images. MUST jointly optimizes three objectives to learn both class-level global feature and pixel-level local feature and enforces a regularization between the two. We demonstrate the efficacy of MUST on 8 downstream tasks across a variety of domains, where it improves upon CLIP by a large margin. MUST also outperforms supervised few-shot adaptation methods.

    "title": "Provable Sim-to-real Transfer in Continuous Domain with Partial Observations",
    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "Sim-to-real transfer, which trains RL agents in the simulated environments and then deploys them in the real world, has been widely used to overcome the limitations of gathering samples in the real world. Despite the empirical success of the sim-to-real transfer, its theoretical foundation is much less understood. In this paper, we study the sim-to-real transfer in continuous domain with partial observations, where the simulated environments and real-world environments are modeled by linear quadratic Gaussian (LQG) systems. We show that a popular robust adversarial training algorithm is capable of learning a policy from the simulated environment that is competitive to the optimal policy in the real-world environment. To achieve our results, we design a new algorithm for infinite-horizon average-cost LQGs and establish a regret bound that depends on the intrinsic complexity of the model class. Our algorithm crucially relies on a novel history clipping scheme, which might be of independent interest",

    "title": "Globally Optimal Training of Neural Networks with Threshold Activation Functions",
    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "Threshold activation functions are highly preferable in neural networks due to their efficiency in hardware implementations. Moreover, their mode of operation is more interpretable and resembles that of biological neurons. However, traditional gradient based algorithms such as Gradient Descent cannot be used to train the parameters of neural networks with threshold activations since the activation function has zero gradient except at a single non-differentiable point. To this end, we study weight decay regularized training problems of deep neural networks with threshold activations. We first show that regularized deep threshold network training problems can be equivalently formulated as a standard convex optimization problem, which parallels the LASSO method, provided that the last hidden layer width exceeds a certain threshold. We also derive a simplified convex optimization formulation when the dataset can be shattered at a certain layer of the network. We corroborate our theoretical results with various numerical experiments",

    "title": "Molecule Generation For Target Protein Binding with Structural Motifs",
    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "Designing ligand molecules that bind to specific protein binding sites is a fundamental problem in structure-based drug design. Although deep generative models and geometric deep learning have made great progress in drug design, existing works either sample in the 2D graph space or fail to generate valid molecules with realistic substructures. To tackle these problems, we propose a Fragment-based LigAnd Generation framework (FLAG), to generate 3D molecules with valid and realistic substructures fragment-by-fragment. In FLAG, a motif vocabulary is constructed by extracting common molecular fragments (i.e., motif) in the dataset. At each generation step, a 3D graph neural network is first employed to encode the intermediate context information. Then, our model selects the focal motif, predicts the next motif type, and attaches the new motif. The bond lengths/angles can be quickly and accurately determined by cheminformatics tools. Finally, the molecular geometry is further adjusted according to the predicted rotation angle and the structure refinement. Our model not only achieves competitive performances on conventional metrics such as binding affinity, QED, and SA, but also outperforms baselines by a large margin in generating molecules with realistic substructures",

    "title": "Rethinking Graph Lottery Tickets: Graph Sparsity Matters",
    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "Lottery Ticket Hypothesis (LTH) claims the existence of a winning ticket (i.e., a properly pruned sub-network together with original weight initialization) that can achieve competitive performance to the original dense network. A recent work, called UGS, extended LTH to prune graph neural networks (GNNs) for effectively accelerating GNN inference. UGS simultaneously prunes the graph adjacency matrix and the model weights using the same masking mechanism, but since the roles of the graph adjacency matrix and the weight matrices are very different, we find that their sparsifications lead to different performance characteristics. Specifically, we find that the performance of a sparsified GNN degrades significantly when the graph sparsity goes beyond a certain extent. Therefore, we propose two techniques to improve GNN performance when the graph sparsity is high. First, UGS prunes the adjacency matrix using a loss formulation which, however, does not properly involve all elements of the adjacency matrix; in contrast, we add a new auxiliary loss head to better guide the edge pruning by involving the entire adjacency matrix. Second, by regarding unfavorable graph sparsification as adversarial data perturbations, we formulate the pruning process as a min-max optimization problem to gain the robustness of lottery tickets when the graph sparsity is high. We further investigate the question: Can the ``retrainable'' winning ticket of a GNN be also effective for graph transferring learning? We call it the transferable graph lottery ticket (GLT) hypothesis. Extensive experiments were conducted which demonstrate the superiority of our proposed sparsification method over UGS, and which empirically verified our transferable GLT hypothesis",

    "title": "Evaluating Long-Term Memory in 3D Mazes",
    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "Intelligent agents need to remember salient information to reason in partially-observed environments. For example, agents with a first-person view should remember the positions of relevant objects even if they go out of view. Similarly, to effectively navigate through rooms agents need to remember the floor plan of how rooms are connected. However, most benchmark tasks in reinforcement learning do not test long-term memory in agents, slowing down progress in this important research direction. In this paper, we introduce the Memory Maze, a 3D domain of randomized mazes specifically designed for evaluating long-term memory in agents. Unlike existing benchmarks, Memory Maze measures long-term memory separate from confounding agent abilities and requires the agent to localize itself by integrating information over time. With Memory Maze, we propose an online reinforcement learning benchmark, a diverse offline dataset, and an offline probing evaluation. Recording a human player establishes a strong baseline and verifies the need to build up and retain memories, which is reflected in their gradually increasing rewards within each episode. We find that current algorithms benefit from training with truncated backpropagation through time and succeed on small mazes, but fall short of human performance on the large mazes, leaving room for future algorithmic designs to be evaluated on the Memory Maze",

Traditional fixed-viewpoint multi-camera solutions for human motion capture (MoCap) are limited in capture space and susceptible to dynamic occlusions. Active camera approaches proactively control camera poses to find optimal viewpoints for 3D reconstruction. However, current methods still face challenges with credit assignment and environment dynamics. To address these issues, our proposed method introduces a novel Collaborative Triangulation Contribution Reward (CTCR) that improves convergence and alleviates multi-agent credit assignment issues resulting from using 3D reconstruction accuracy as the shared reward. Additionally, we jointly train our model with multiple world dynamics learning tasks to better capture environment dynamics and encourage anticipatory behaviors for occlusion avoidance. We evaluate our proposed method in four photo-realistic UE4 environments to ensure validity and generalizability. Empirical results show that our method outperforms fixed and active baselines in various scenarios with different numbers of cameras and humans",

    "title": "Become a Proficient Player with Limited Data through Watching Pure Videos",
    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "Recently, RL has shown its strong ability for visually complex tasks. However, it suffers from the low sample efficiency and poor generalization ability, which prevent RL from being useful in real-world scenarios. Inspired by the huge success of unsupervised pre-training methods on language and vision domains, we propose to improve the sample efficiency via a novel pre-training method for model-based RL. Instead of using pre-recorded agent trajectories that come with their own actions, we consider the setting where the pre-training data are action-free videos, which are more common and available in the real world. We introduce a two-phase training pipeline as follows: for the pre-training phase, we implicitly extract the hidden action embedding from videos and pre-train the visual representation and the environment dynamics network through a novel \\Changes{forward-inverse} cycle consistency \\Changes{(FICC)} objective based on vector quantization; for down-stream tasks, we finetune with small amount of task data based on the learned models. Our framework can significantly improve the sample efficiency on Atari Games with data of only one hour of game playing. We achieve 118.4\\% mean human performance and 36.0\\% median performance with only 50k environment steps, which is 85.6\\% and 65.1\\% better than the scratch EfficientZero model. We believe such pre-training approach can provide an option for solving real-world RL problems. The code is available at \\url{https://github.com/YeWR/FICC.git}",

    "title": "Human MotionFormer: Transferring Human Motions with Vision Transformers",
    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "Human motion transfer aims to transfer motions from a target dynamic person to a source static one for motion synthesis. An accurate matching between the source person and the target motion in both large and subtle motion changes is vital for improving the transferred motion quality. In this paper, we propose Human MotionFormer, a hierarchical ViT framework that leverages global and local perceptions to capture large and subtle motion matching, respectively. It consists of two ViT encoders to extract input features (i.e., a target motion image and a source human image) and a ViT decoder with several cascaded blocks for feature matching and motion transfer. In each block, we set the target motion feature as Query and the source person as Key and Value, calculating the cross-attention maps to conduct a global feature matching. Further, we introduce a convolutional layer to improve the local perception after the global cross-attention computations. This matching process is implemented in both warping and generation branches to guide the motion transfer. During training, we propose a mutual learning loss to enable the co-supervision between warping and generation branches for better motion representations. Experiments show that our Human MotionFormer sets the new state-of-the-art performance both qualitatively and quantitatively. Project page: https://github.com/KumapowerLIU/Human-MotionFormer",

    "abstract": "Asymmetric image retrieval aims to deploy compatible models on platforms of different resources to achieve a balance between computational efficiency and retrieval accuracy. The most critical issue is how to align the output features of different models. Despite the great progress, existing approaches apply strong constraints so that features or neighbor structures are strictly aligned across different models. However, such a one-to-one constraint is too strict to be well preserved for the query models with low capacity. Considering that the primary concern of the users is the rank of the returned images, we propose a generic rank preserving framework, which achieves feature compatibility and the order consistency between query and gallery models simultaneously. Specifically, we propose two alternatives to instantiate the framework. One realizes straightforward rank order preservation by directly preserving the consistency of the sorting results. To make sorting process differentiable, the Heaviside step function in sorting is approximated by the sigmoid function. The other aims to preserve a learnable monotonic mapping relationship between the returned similarity scores of query and gallery models. The mapped similarity scores of gallery model are considered as pseudo-supervision to guide the query model training. Extensive experiments on various large-scale datasets demonstrate the superiority of our two proposed methods",

Recent work has proven that the strong duality holds (which means zero duality gap) for regularized finite-width two-layer ReLU networks and consequently provided an equivalent convex training problem. However, extending this result to deeper networks remains to be an open problem. In this paper, we prove that the duality gap for deeper linear networks with vector outputs is non-zero. In contrast, we show that the zero duality gap can be obtained by stacking standard deep networks in parallel, which we call a parallel architecture, and modifying the regularization. Therefore, we prove the strong duality and existence of equivalent convex problems that enable globally optimal training of deep networks. As a by-product of our analysis, we demonstrate that the weight decay regularization on the network parameters explicitly encourages low-rank solutions via closed-form expressions. In addition, we show that strong duality holds for three-layer standard ReLU networks given rank-1 data matrices",

Yet imperceptible adversarial perturbations can significantly reduce CLIP's performance on new tasks. In this work, we identify and explore the problem of adapting large-scale models for zero-shot adversarial robustness. We first identify two key factors during model adaption--training losses and adaptation methods--that affect the model's zero-shot adversarial robustness. We then propose a text-guided contrastive adversarial training loss, which aligns the text embeddings and the adversarial visual features with contrastive learning on a small set of training data. We apply this training loss to two adaption methods, model finetuning and visual prompt tuning. We find that visual prompt tuning is more effective in the absence of texts, while finetuning wins in the existence of text guidance. Overall, our approach significantly improves the zero-shot adversarial robustness over CLIP, seeing an average improvement of 31 points over ImageNet and 15 zero-shot datasets. We hope this work can shed light on understanding the zero-shot adversarial robustness of large-scale models",

People usually mask an input variable using its baseline value. However, there is no theory to examine whether baseline value faithfully represents the absence of an input variable, i.e., removing all signals from the input variable. Fortunately, recent studies (Ren et al., 2023a; Deng et al., 2022a) show that the inference score of a DNN can be strictly disentangled into a set of causal patterns (or concepts) encoded by the DNN. Therefore, we propose to use causal patterns to examine the faithfulness of baseline values. More crucially, it is proven that causal patterns can be explained as the elementary rationale of the Shapley value. Furthermore, we propose a method to learn optimal baseline values, and experimental results have demonstrated its effectiveness",

Oftentimes fine-tuned models are readily available but their training data is not, due to data privacy or intellectual property concerns. This creates a barrier to fusing knowledge across individual models to yield a better single model. In this paper, we study the problem of merging individual models built on different training data sets to obtain a single model that performs well both across all data set domains and can generalize on out-of-domain data. We propose a data-less knowledge fusion method that merges models in their parameter space, guided by weights that minimize prediction differences between the merged model and the individual models. Over a battery of evaluation settings, we show that the proposed method significantly outperforms baselines such as Fisher-weighted averaging or model ensembling. Further, we find that our method is a promising alternative to multi-task learning that can preserve or sometimes improve over the individual models without access to the training data. Finally, model merging is more efficient than training a multi-task model, thus making it applicable to a wider set of scenarios",

To address this challenge, we propose a differentiable optical flow data generation pipeline and a loss function to drive the pipeline, called DFlow. DFlow efficiently synthesizes a dataset effective for a target domain without the need for cumbersome try-and-errors. This favorable property is achieved by proposing an efficient dataset comparison method that uses neural networks to approximately encode each dataset and compares the proxy networks instead of explicitly comparing datasets in a pairwise way.

Recent works by Da Cunha et. al 2022, Burkholz 2022 demonstrate that the SLTH can be extended to translation equivariant networks---i.e. CNNs---with the same level of overparametrization as needed for the SLTs in dense networks. However, modern neural networks are capable of incorporating more than just translation symmetry, and developing general equivariant architectures such as rotation and permutation has been a powerful design principle. In this paper, we generalize the SLTH to functions that preserve the action of the group $G$---i.e. $G$-equivariant network---and prove, with high probability, that one can approximate any $G$-equivariant network of fixed width and depth by pruning a randomly initialized overparametrized $G$-equivariant network to a $G$-equivariant subnetwork. We further prove that our prescribed overparametrization scheme is optimal and provide a lower bound on the number of effective parameters as a function of the error tolerance. We develop our theory for a large range of groups, including subgroups of the Euclidean $\\text{E}(2)$ and Symmetric group $G \\leq \\mathcal{S}_n$---allowing us to find SLTs for MLPs, CNNs, $\\text{E}(2)$-steerable CNNs, and permutation equivariant networks as specific instantiations of our unified framework.

As a result, we can process vision and language data using transformers that are architecturally similar. Leveraging this feature of transformers, we propose weight sharing across two transformer backbones and within the same transformer backbone and pruning across two backbones in a unified framework. More specifically, we investigate weight sharing and pruning for two components of the transformers: (1) Multi-Head Attention (MSA) and (2) Feed-Forward Network (FFN) layers. To jointly perform weight sharing and pruning, we propose to use a regularization term to align model weights and the desired structure during the multimodal pre-training step. The structure vectors of sharing and pruning are generated by using a hypernetwork, which can capture complex interactions between pruning and sharing across layers and modalities. We train the hypernetwork and model weights iteratively so that the learned structure evolves along with model weights. After minimizing the proposed objective in the pre-training step, we perform weight sharing and pruning and fine-tune the compressed model on downstream tasks. Finally, we perform experiments on vision and language tasks, including Referring Expression Comprehension (REC), Visual Question Answering (VQA), and Object Detection using the state-of-the-art grounding based models: MDETR and GLIP.

Emerging methods attempt to learn domain-invariant representations using graph neural networks (GNNs), yet the empirical performances vary and the theoretical foundation is limited. This paper aims at designing theory-grounded algorithms for graph domain adaptation (GDA). (i) As the first attempt, we derive a model-based GDA bound closely related to two GNN spectral properties: spectral smoothness (SS) and maximum frequency response (MFR). This is achieved by cross-pollinating between the OT-based (optimal transport) DA and graph filter theories. (ii) Inspired by the theoretical results, we propose algorithms regularizing spectral properties of SS and MFR to improve GNN transferability. We further extend the GDA theory into the more challenging scenario of conditional shift, where spectral regularization still applies. (iii) More importantly, our analyses of the theory reveal which regularization would improve performance of what transfer learning scenario, (iv) with numerical agreement with extensive real-world experiments: SS and MFR regularizations bring more benefits to the scenarios of node transfer and link transfer, respectively.

Our theoretical analysis provides an upper bound on the return gap between the learned policy and the expert policy, based on which we characterize the impact of covariate shift by examining subtle two-tier tradeoffs between the exploitation (on both expert and diverse data) and exploration (on the estimated dynamics model). We show that CLARE can provably alleviate the reward extrapolation error by striking the right exploitation-exploration balance therein. Extensive experiments corroborate the significant performance gains of CLARE over existing state-of-the-art algorithms on MuJoCo continuous control tasks (especially with a small offline dataset), and the learned reward is highly instructive for further learning",

    "title": "Data-Free One-Shot Federated Learning Under Very High Statistical Heterogeneity",
    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "Federated learning (FL) is an emerging distributed learning framework that collaboratively trains a shared model without transferring the local clients' data to a centralized server. Motivated by concerns stemming from extended communication and potential attacks, one-shot FL limits communication to a single round while attempting to retain performance. However, one-shot FL methods often degrade under high statistical heterogeneity, fail to promote pipeline security, or require an auxiliary public dataset. To address these limitations, we propose two novel data-free one-shot FL methods: FedCVAE-Ens and its extension FedCVAE-KD. Both approaches reframe the local learning task using a conditional variational autoencoder (CVAE) to address high statistical heterogeneity. Furthermore, FedCVAE-KD leverages knowledge distillation to compress the ensemble of client decoders into a single decoder. We propose a method that shifts the center of the CVAE prior distribution and experimentally demonstrate that this promotes security, and show how either method can incorporate heterogeneous local models. We confirm the efficacy of the proposed methods over baselines under high statistical heterogeneity using multiple benchmark datasets. In particular, at the highest levels of statistical heterogeneity, both FedCVAE-Ens and FedCVAE-KD typically more than double the accuracy of the baselines",

    "title": "GReTo: Remedying dynamic graph topology-task discordance via target homophily",
    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "Dynamic graphs are ubiquitous across disciplines where observations usually change over time. Regressions on dynamic graphs often contribute to diverse critical tasks, such as climate early-warning and traffic controlling. Existing homophily Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) adopt physical connections or feature similarity as adjacent matrix to perform node-level aggregations. However, on dynamic graphs with diverse node-wise relations, exploiting a pre-defined fixed topology for message passing inevitably leads to the aggregations of target-deviated neighbors. We designate such phenomenon as the topology-task discordance, which naturally challenges the homophily assumption. In this work, we revisit node-wise relationships and explore novel homophily measurements on dynamic graphs with both signs and distances, capturing multiple node-level spatial relations and temporal evolutions. We discover that advancing homophily aggregations to signed target-oriented message passing can effectively resolve the discordance and promote aggregation capacity. Therefore, a GReTo is proposed, which performs signed message passing in immediate neighborhood, and exploits both local environments and target awareness to realize high-order message propagation. Empirically, our solution achieves significant improvements against best baselines, notably improving 24.79% on KnowAir and 3.60% on Metr-LA",

    "title": "Deep Reinforcement Learning for Cost-Effective Medical Diagnosis",
    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "Dynamic diagnosis is desirable when medical tests are costly or time-consuming. In this work, we use reinforcement learning (RL) to find a dynamic policy that selects lab test panels sequentially based on previous observations, ensuring accurate testing at a low cost. Clinical diagnostic data are often highly imbalanced; therefore, we aim to maximize the F1 score instead of the error rate. However, optimizing the non-concave $F_1$ score is not a classic RL problem, thus invalidating standard RL methods. To remedy this issue, we develop a reward shaping approach, leveraging properties of the $F_1$ score and duality of policy optimization, to provably find the set of all Pareto-optimal policies for budget-constrained $F_1$ score maximization. To handle the combinatorially complex state space, we propose a Semi-Model-based Deep Diagnosis Policy Optimization (SM-DDPO) framework that is compatible with end-to-end training and online learning. SM-DDPO is tested on diverse clinical tasks: ferritin abnormality detection, sepsis mortality prediction, and acute kidney injury diagnosis. Experiments with real-world data validate that SM-DDPO trains efficiently and identify all Pareto-front solutions. Across all tasks, SM-DDPO is able to achieve state-of-the-art diagnosis accuracy (in some cases higher than conventional methods) with up to $85\\%$ reduction in testing cost.

    "abstract": "Real world applications of Reinforcement Learning (RL) are often partially observable, thus requiring memory. Despite this, partial observability is still largely ignored by contemporary RL benchmarks and libraries. We introduce Partially Observable Process Gym (POPGym), a two-part library containing (1) a diverse collection of 15 partially observable environments, each with multiple difficulties and (2) implementations of 13 memory model baselines -- the most in a single RL library. Existing partially observable benchmarks tend to fixate on 3D visual navigation, which is computationally expensive and only one type of POMDP. In contrast, POPGym environments are diverse, produce smaller observations, use less memory, and often converge within two hours of training on a consumer-grade GPU. We implement our high-level memory API and memory baselines on top of the popular RLlib framework, providing plug-and-play compatibility with various training algorithms, exploration strategies, and distributed training paradigms. Using POPGym, we execute the largest comparison across RL memory models to date. POPGym is available at https://github.com/proroklab/popgym",

    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "Learning models from human behavioural data often leads to outputs that are biased with respect to user demographics, such as gender or race. This effect can be controlled by explicit mitigation methods, but this typically presupposes access to demographically-labelled training data. Such data is often not available, motivating the need for unsupervised debiasing methods. To this end, we propose a new meta-algorithm for debiasing representation learning models, which combines the notions of data locality and accuracy of model fit, such that a supervised debiasing method can optimise fairness between neighbourhoods of poorly vs. well modelled instances as identified by our method. Results over five datasets, spanning natural language processing and structured data classification tasks, show that our technique recovers proxy labels that correlate with unknown demographic data, and that our method outperforms all unsupervised baselines, while also achieving competitive performance with state-of-the-art supervised methods which are given access to demographic labels",

    "title": "Particle-based Variational Inference with Preconditioned Functional Gradient Flow",
    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "Particle-based variational inference (VI) minimizes the KL divergence between model samples and the target posterior with gradient flow estimates. With the popularity of Stein variational gradient descent (SVGD), the focus of particle-based VI algorithms has been on the properties of functions in Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS) to approximate the gradient flow. However, the requirement of RKHS restricts the function class and algorithmic flexibility. This paper offers a general solution to this problem by introducing a functional regularization term that encompasses the RKHS norm as a special case. This allows us to propose a new particle-based VI algorithm called preconditioned functional gradient flow (PFG). Compared to SVGD, PFG has several advantages. It has a larger function class, improved scalability in large particle-size scenarios, better adaptation to ill-conditioned distributions, and provable continuous-time convergence in KL divergence. Additionally, non-linear function classes such as neural networks can be incorporated to estimate the gradient flow. Our theory and experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework",

However, some recent studies revealed that the context representations produced by these methods suffer the problem of anisotropy. In this paper, we find that the generated representations are also not conversational, losing the conversation structure information during the context modeling stage. To this end, we identify two properties in dialogue modeling, i.e., locality and isotropy, and present a simple method for dialogue representation calibration, namely SimDRC, to build isotropic and conversational feature spaces. Experimental results show that our approach significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art models on three open-domain dialogue tasks with eight benchmarks.

    "title": "Combating Exacerbated Heterogeneity for Robust Models in Federated Learning",
    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "Privacy and security concerns in real-world applications have led to the development of adversarially robust federated models. However, the straightforward combination between adversarial training and federated learning in one framework can lead to the undesired robustness deterioration. We discover that the attribution behind this phenomenon is that the generated adversarial data could exacerbate the data heterogeneity among local clients, making the wrapped federated learning perform poorly. To deal with this problem, we propose a novel framework called Slack Federated Adversarial Training (SFAT), assigning the client-wise slack during aggregation to combat the intensified heterogeneity. Theoretically, we analyze the convergence of the proposed method to properly relax the objective when combining federated learning and adversarial training. Experimentally, we verify the rationality and effectiveness of SFAT on various benchmarked and real-world datasets with different adversarial training and federated optimization methods.

    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "Causal representation learning is the task of identifying the underlying causal variables and their relations from high-dimensional observations, such as images. Recent work has shown that one can reconstruct the causal variables from temporal sequences of observations under the assumption that there are no instantaneous causal relations between them. In practical applications, however, our measurement or frame rate might be slower than many of the causal effects. This effectively creates ``instantaneous'' effects and invalidates previous identifiability results. To address this issue, we propose iCITRIS, a causal representation learning method that allows for instantaneous effects in intervened temporal sequences when intervention targets can be observed, e.g., as actions of an agent. iCITRIS identifies the potentially multidimensional causal variables from temporal observations, while simultaneously using a differentiable causal discovery method to learn their causal graph. In experiments on three datasets of interactive systems, iCITRIS accurately identifies the causal variables and their causal graph",

    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "Long-term engagement is preferred over immediate engagement in sequential recommendation as it directly affects product operational metrics such as daily active users (DAUs) and dwell time. Meanwhile, reinforcement learning (RL) is widely regarded as a promising framework for optimizing long-term engagement in sequential recommendation. However, due to expensive online interactions, it is very difficult for RL algorithms to perform state-action value estimation, exploration and feature extraction when optimizing long-term engagement. In this paper, we propose ResAct which seeks a policy that is close to, but better than, the online-serving policy. In this way, we can collect sufficient data near the learned policy so that state-action values can be properly estimated, and there is no need to perform online exploration. ResAct optimizes the policy by first reconstructing the online behaviors and then improving it via a Residual Actor. To extract long-term information, ResAct utilizes two information-theoretical regularizers to confirm the expressiveness and conciseness of features. We conduct experiments on a benchmark dataset and a large-scale industrial dataset which consists of tens of millions of recommendation requests. Experimental results show that our method significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines in various long-term engagement optimization tasks",

    "abstract": "The great success of deep learning heavily relies on increasingly larger training data, which comes at a price of huge computational and infrastructural costs. This poses crucial questions that, do all training data contribute to model's performance? How much does each individual training sample or a sub-training-set affect the model's generalization, and how to construct the smallest subset from the entire training data as a proxy training set without significantly sacrificing the model's performance? To answer these, we propose dataset pruning, an optimization-based sample selection method that can (1) examine the influence of removing a particular set of training samples on model's generalization ability with theoretical guarantee, and (2) construct the smallest subset of training data that yields strictly constrained generalization gap. The empirically observed generalization gap of dataset pruning is substantially consistent with our theoretical expectations. Furthermore, the proposed method prunes 40% training examples on the CIFAR-10 dataset, halves the convergence time with only 1.3% test accuracy decrease, which is superior to previous score-based sample selection methods",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we present StrucTexTv2, an effective document image pre-training framework, by performing masked visual-textual prediction. It consists of two self-supervised pre-training tasks: masked image modeling and masked language modeling, based on text region-level image masking. The proposed method randomly masks some image regions according to the bounding box coordinates of text words. The objectives of our pre-training tasks are reconstructing the pixels of masked image regions and the corresponding masked tokens simultaneously. Hence the pre-trained encoder can capture more textual semantics in comparison to the masked image modeling that usually predicts the masked image patches. Compared to the masked multi-modal modeling methods for document image understanding that rely on both the image and text modalities, StrucTexTv2 models image-only input and potentially deals with more application scenarios free from OCR pre-processing. Extensive experiments on mainstream benchmarks of document image understanding demonstrate the effectiveness of StrucTexTv2. It achieves competitive or even new state-of-the-art performance in various downstream tasks such as image classification, layout analysis, table structure recognition, document OCR, and information extraction under the end-to-end scenario",

Such a phenomenon may seem to suggest that optimization of neural networks is easy. In this paper, we show that the MLI property is not necessarily related to the hardness of optimization problems, and empirical observations on MLI for deep neural networks depend heavily on the biases. In particular, we show that interpolating both weights and biases linearly leads to very different influences on the final output, and when different classes have different last-layer biases on a deep network, there will be a long plateau in both the loss and accuracy interpolation (which existing theory of MLI cannot explain). We also show how the last-layer biases for different classes can be different even on a perfectly balanced dataset using a simple model. Empirically we demonstrate that similar intuitions hold on practical networks and realistic datasets",

    "abstract": "Differing from the well-developed horizontal object detection area whereby the computing-friendly IoU based loss is readily adopted and well fits with the detection metrics, rotation detectors often involve a more complicated loss based on SkewIoU which is unfriendly to gradient-based training. In this paper, we propose an effective approximate SkewIoU loss based on Gaussian modeling and Gaussian product, which mainly consists of two items. The first term is a scale-insensitive center point loss, which is used to quickly narrow the distance between the center points of the two bounding boxes. In the distance-independent second term, the product of the Gaussian distributions is adopted to inherently mimic the mechanism of SkewIoU by its definition, and show its alignment with the SkewIoU loss at trend-level within a certain distance (i.e. within 9 pixels). This is in contrast to recent Gaussian modeling based rotation detectors e.g. GWD loss and KLD loss that involve a human-specified distribution distance metric which require additional hyperparameter tuning that vary across datasets and detectors. The resulting new loss called KFIoU loss is easier to implement and works better compared with exact SkewIoU loss, thanks to its full differentiability and ability to handle the non-overlapping cases. We further extend our technique to the 3-D case which also suffers from the same issues as 2-D. Extensive results on various datasets with different base detectors show the effectiveness of our approach",

Our approach generalizes to new subjects with electrodes in new positions and to unrelated tasks showing that the representations robustly disentangle the neural signal. Just like in NLP where one can study language by investigating what a language model learns, this approach opens the door to investigating the brain by what a model of the brain learns. As a first step along this path, we demonstrate a new analysis of the intrinsic dimensionality of the computations in different areas of the brain. To construct these representations, we combine a technique for producing super-resolution spectrograms of neural data with an approach designed for generating contextual representations of audio by masking.

Aiming to boost the computation efﬁciency and rendering quality of 3D scenes, a popular line of research maps the 3D coordinate system to another measuring system, e.g., 2D manifolds and hash tables, for modeling neural fields. The conversion of coordinate systems can be typically dubbed as \\emph{gauge transformation}, which is usually a pre-defined mapping function, e.g., orthogonal projection or spatial hash function. This begs a question: can we directly learn a desired gauge transformation along with the neural field in an end-to-end manner? In this work, we extend this problem to a general paradigm with a taxonomy of discrete and continuous cases, and develop an end-to-end learning framework to jointly optimize the gauge transformation and neural fields. To counter the problem that the learning of gauge transformations can collapse easily, we derive a general regularization mechanism from the principle of information conservation during the gauge transformation. To circumvent the high computation cost in gauge learning with regularization, we directly derive an information-invariant gauge transformation which allows to preserve scene information inherently and yield superior performance",

    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "Knowledge-intensive tasks, such as open-domain question answering (QA), require access to a large amount of world or domain knowledge. A common approach for knowledge-intensive tasks is to employ a retrieve-then-read pipeline that first retrieves a handful of relevant contextual documents from an external corpus such as Wikipedia and then predicts an answer conditioned on the retrieved documents. In this paper, we present a novel perspective for solving knowledge-intensive tasks by replacing document retrievers with large language model generators. We call our method generate-then-read (GenRead), which first prompts a large language model to generate contextual documents based on a given question, and then reads the generated documents to produce the final answer. Furthermore, we propose a novel clustering-based prompting method that selects distinct prompts, in order to generate diverse documents that cover different perspectives, leading to better recall over acceptable answers. We conduct extensive experiments on three different knowledge-intensive tasks, including open-domain QA, fact checking, and dialogue system. Notably, GenRead achieves 71.6 and 54.4 exact match scores on TriviaQA and WebQ, significantly outperforming the state-of-the-art retrieve-then-read pipeline DPR-FiD by +4.0 and +3.9, without retrieving any documents from any external knowledge source.

Previous works have focused on exploring contrastive learning for cross-domain alignment. However, limited variations in intra-domain positives, false cross-domain positives, and false negatives hinder contrastive learning from fulfilling intra-domain discrimination and cross-domain closeness. This paper presents a non-contrastive learning framework without relying on negative samples for unsupervised video domain adaptation. To address the limited variations in intra-domain positives, we set unlabeled target videos as anchors and explored to mine \"informative intra-domain positives\" in the form of spatial/temporal augmentations and target nearest neighbors (NNs). To tackle the false cross-domain positives led by noisy pseudo-labels, we reversely set source videos as anchors and sample the synthesized target videos as \"robust cross-domain positives\" from an estimated target distribution, which are naturally more robust to the pseudo-label noise. Our approach is demonstrated to be superior to state-of-the-art methods through extensive experiments on several cross-domain action recognition benchmarks",

    "abstract": "Empirical risk minimization (ERM) is known to be non-robust in practice to distributional shift where the training and the test distributions are different. A suite of approaches, such as importance weighting, and variants of distributionally robust optimization (DRO), have been proposed to solve this problem. But a line of recent work has empirically shown that these approaches do not significantly improve over ERM in real applications with distribution shift. The goal of this work is to obtain a comprehensive theoretical understanding of this intriguing phenomenon. We first posit the class of Generalized Reweighting (GRW) algorithms, as a broad category of approaches that iteratively update model parameters based on iterative reweighting of the training samples. We show that when overparameterized models are trained under GRW, the resulting models are close to that obtained by ERM. We also show that adding small regularization which does not greatly affect the empirical training accuracy does not help. Together, our results show that a broad category of what we term GRW approaches are not able to achieve distributionally robust generalization. Our work thus has the following sobering takeaway: to make progress towards distributionally robust generalization, we either have to develop non-GRW approaches, or perhaps devise novel classification/regression loss functions that are adapted to GRW approaches",

    "abstract": "In the mode connectivity literature, it is widely accepted that there are common circumstances in which two neural networks, trained similarly on the same data, will maintain loss when interpolated in the weight space. In particular, transfer learning is presumed to ensure the necessary conditions for linear mode connectivity across training runs. In contrast to existing results from image classification, we find that among text classifiers (trained on MNLI, QQP, and CoLA), some pairs of finetuned models have large barriers of increasing loss on the linear paths between them. On each task, we find distinct clusters of models which are linearly connected on the test loss surface, but are disconnected from models outside the cluster---models that occupy separate basins on the surface. By measuring performance on specially-crafted diagnostic datasets, we find that these clusters correspond to different generalization strategies. For example, on MNLI, one cluster behaves like a bag of words model under domain shift, while another cluster uses syntactic heuristics. Our work demonstrates how the geometry of the loss surface can guide models towards different heuristic functions in standard finetuning settings",

Although ratio matching is a sound method to learn discrete EBMs, it suffers from expensive computation and excessive memory requirements, thereby resulting in difficulties in learning EBMs on high-dimensional data. Motivated by these limitations, in this study, we propose ratio matching with gradient-guided importance sampling (RMwGGIS). Particularly, we use the gradient of the energy function w.r.t. the discrete data space to approximately construct the provably optimal proposal distribution, which is subsequently used by importance sampling to efficiently estimate the original ratio matching objective. We perform experiments on density modeling over synthetic discrete data, graph generation, and training Ising models to evaluate our proposed method. The experimental results demonstrate that our method can significantly alleviate the limitations of ratio matching, perform more effectively in practice, and scale to high-dimensional problems.

Language models such as GPT-3 are capable of textual reasoning but cannot understand visual information, while vision models such as DALL-E can generate photorealistic photos but fail to understand complex language descriptions. In this work, we propose a unified framework for composing ensembles of different pre-trained models -- combining the strengths of each individual model to solve various multimodal problems in a zero-shot manner. We use pre-trained models as \"generators\" or \"scorers\" and compose them via closed-loop iterative consensus optimization. The generator constructs proposals and the scorers iteratively provide feedback to refine the generated result. Such closed-loop communication enables models to correct errors caused by other models, significantly boosting performance on downstream tasks, e.g. improving accuracy on grade school math problems by 7.5%, without requiring any model finetuning. We demonstrate that consensus achieved by an ensemble of scorers outperforms the feedback of a single scorer, by leveraging the strengths of each expert model.

The Centered Kernel Alignment (CKA) similarity metric, particularly its linear variant, has recently become a popular approach and has been widely used to compare representations of a network's different layers, of architecturally similar networks trained differently, or of models with different architectures trained on the same data. A wide variety of claims about similarity and dissimilarity of these various representations have been made using CKA results. In this work we present analysis that formally characterizes CKA sensitivity to a large class of simple transformations, which can naturally occur in the context of modern machine learning. This provides a concrete explanation to CKA sensitivity to outliers, which has been observed in past works, and to transformations that preserve the linear separability of the data, an important generalization attribute. We empirically investigate several weaknesses of the CKA similarity metric, demonstrating situations in which it gives unexpected or counterintuitive results. Finally we study approaches for modifying representations to maintain functional behaviour while changing the CKA value. Our results illustrate that, in many cases, the CKA value can be easily manipulated without substantial changes to the functional behaviour of the models, and call for caution when leveraging activation alignment metrics",

    "abstract": "Tackling unfairness in graph learning models is a challenging task, as the unfairness issues on graphs involve both attributes and topological structures. Existing work on fair graph learning simply assumes that attributes of all nodes are available for model training and then makes fair predictions. In practice, however, the attributes of some nodes might not be accessible due to missing data or privacy concerns, which makes fair graph learning even more challenging. In this paper, we propose FairAC, a fair attribute completion method, to complement missing information and learn fair node embeddings for graphs with missing attributes. FairAC adopts an attention mechanism to deal with the attribute missing problem and meanwhile, it mitigates two types of unfairness, i.e., feature unfairness from attributes and topological unfairness due to attribute completion. FairAC can work on various types of homogeneous graphs and generate fair embeddings for them and thus can be applied to most downstream tasks to improve their fairness performance. To our best knowledge, FairAC is the first method that jointly addresses the graph attribution completion and graph unfairness problems. Experimental results on benchmark datasets show that our method achieves better fairness performance with less sacrifice in accuracy, compared with the state-of-the-art methods of fair graph learning.

As a result, we present a novel method that meta-learns neural network surrogates optimized for ranking the configurations' performances while modeling their uncertainty via ensembling.

One generalizable and scalable strategy for HOI detection is to use weak supervision, learning from image-level annotations only. This is inherently challenging due to ambiguous human-object associations, large search space of detecting HOIs and highly noisy training signal. A promising strategy to address those challenges is to exploit knowledge from large-scale pretrained models (e.g., CLIP), but a direct knowledge distillation strategy does not perform well on the weakly-supervised setting. In contrast, we develop a CLIP-guided HOI representation capable of incorporating the prior knowledge at both image level and HOI instance level, and adopt a self-taught mechanism to prune incorrect human-object associations. Experimental results on HICO-DET and V-COCO show that our method outperforms the previous works by a sizable margin, showing the efficacy of our HOI representation",

    "title": "ERL-Re$^2$: Efficient Evolutionary Reinforcement Learning with Shared State Representation and Individual Policy Representation",
    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "Deep Reinforcement Learning (Deep RL) and Evolutionary Algorithm (EA) are two major paradigms of policy optimization with distinct learning principles, i.e., gradient-based v.s. gradient-free. An appealing research direction is integrating Deep RL and EA to devise new methods by fusing their complementary advantages. However, existing works on combining Deep RL and EA have two common drawbacks:1) the RL agent and EA agents learn their policies individually, neglecting efficient sharing of useful common knowledge; 2) parameter-level policy optimization guarantees no semantic level of behavior evolution for the EA side. In this paper, we propose Evolutionary Reinforcement Learning with Two-scale State Representation and Policy Representation (ERL-Re$^2$), a novel solution to the aforementioned two drawbacks. The key idea of ERL-Re$^2$ is two-scale representation: all EA and RL policies share the same nonlinear state representation while maintaining individual linear policy representations. The state representation conveys expressive common features of the environment learned by all the agents collectively; the linear policy representation provides a favorable space for efficient policy optimization, where novel behavior-level crossover and mutation operations can be performed. Moreover, the linear policy representation allows convenient generalization of policy fitness with the help of Policy-extended Value Function Approximator (PeVFA), further improving the sample efficiency of fitness estimation. The experiments on a range of continuous control tasks show that ERL-Re$^2$ consistently outperforms advanced baselines and achieves the State Of The Art (SOTA).

    "abstract": "Chain-of-thought prompting has demonstrated remarkable performance on various natural language reasoning tasks. However, it tends to perform poorly on tasks which requires solving problems harder than the exemplars shown in the prompts. To overcome this challenge of easy-to-hard generalization, we propose a novel prompting strategy, least-to-most prompting. The key idea in this strategy is to break down a complex problem into a series of simpler subproblems and then solve them in sequence. Solving each subproblem is facilitated by the answers to previously solved subproblems. Our experimental results on tasks related to symbolic manipulation, compositional generalization, and math reasoning reveal that least-to-most prompting is capable of generalizing to more difficult problems than those seen in the prompts. A notable finding is that when the GPT-3 code-davinci-002 model is used with least-to-most prompting, it can solve the compositional generalization benchmark SCAN in any split (including length split) with an accuracy of at least 99\\% using just 14 exemplars, compared to only 16\\% accuracy with chain-of-thought prompting. This is particularly noteworthy because neural-symbolic models in the literature that specialize in solving SCAN are trained on the entire training set containing over 15,000 examples.

To address this, we propose a novel Deep Graph Ensemble (DGE), which captures neighborhood variance by training an ensemble of GNNs on different neighborhood subspaces of the same node within a higher-order network structure. We show that DGE consistently outperforms existing GNNs on semisupervised and supervised tasks on six real-world data sets with known higher-order dependencies, even under a similar parameter budget. We demonstrate that learning diverse and accurate base classifiers is central to DGE's success, and discuss the implications of these findings for future work on GNNs",

    "abstract": "For unsupervised pretraining, mask-reconstruction pretraining (MRP) approaches, e.g. MAE and data2vec, randomly mask input patches and then reconstruct the pixels or semantic features of these masked patches via an auto-encoder. Then for a downstream task, supervised fine-tuning the pretrained encoder remarkably surpasses the conventional \"supervised learning\" (SL) trained from scratch. However, it is still unclear 1) how MRP performs semantic (feature) learning in the pretraining phase and 2) why it helps in downstream tasks. To solve these problems, we first theoretically show that on an auto-encoder of a two/one-layered convolution encoder/decoder, MRP can capture all discriminative semantics of each potential semantic class in the pretraining dataset. Then considering the fact that the pretraining dataset is of huge size and high diversity and thus covers most semantics in downstream dataset, in fine-tuning phase, the pretrained encoder can capture as much semantics as it can in downstream datasets, and would not lost these semantics with theoretical guarantees. In contrast, SL only randomly captures some semantics due to lottery ticket hypothesis. So MRP provably achieves better performance than SL on the classification tasks. Experimental results testify to our data assumptions and also our theoretical implications",

To reduce the heavy annotations needed for supervised learning methods, we present a novel self-supervised strategy that solves this problem without any human labels. Our key idea is to factorize canonical shapes and articulated object poses from input articulated shapes through part-level equivariant shape analysis. Specifically, we first introduce the concept of part-level SE(3) equivariance and devise a network to learn features of such property. Then, through a carefully designed fine-grained pose-shape disentanglement strategy, we expect that canonical spaces to support pose estimation could be induced automatically. Thus, we could further predict articulated object poses as per-part rigid transformations describing how parts transform from their canonical part spaces to the camera space. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on both complete and partial point clouds from synthetic and real articulated object datasets",

In contrast, traditional neural networks suffer from forgetting in changing environments and many methods have been proposed to limit forgetting with different trade-offs. Inspired by the brain thalamocortical circuit, we introduce a simple algorithm that uses optimization at inference time to generate internal representations of the current task dynamically. The algorithm alternates between updating the model weights and a latent task embedding, allowing the agent to parse the stream of temporal experience into discrete events and organize learning about them. On a continual learning benchmark, it achieves competitive end average accuracy by mitigating forgetting, but importantly, the interaction between the weights dynamics and the latent dynamics organizes knowledge into flexible structures with a cognitive interface to control them. Tasks later in the sequence can be solved through knowledge transfer as they become reachable within the well-factorized latent space. The algorithm meets many of the desiderata of an ideal continually learning agent in open-ended environments, and its simplicity suggests fundamental computations in circuits with abundant feedback control loops such as the thalamocortical circuits in the brain",

    "abstract": "Implicit processes (IPs) are a generalization of Gaussian processes (GPs). IPs may lack a closed-form expression but are easy to sample from. Examples include, among others, Bayesian neural networks or neural samplers. IPs can be used as priors over functions, resulting in flexible models with well-calibrated prediction uncertainty estimates. Methods based on IPs usually carry out function-space approximate inference, which overcomes some of the difficulties of parameter-space approximate inference. Nevertheless, the approximations employed often limit the expressiveness of the final model, resulting, e.g., in a Gaussian predictive distribution, which can be restrictive. We propose here a multi-layer generalization of IPs called the Deep Variational Implicit process (DVIP). This generalization is similar to that of deep GPs over GPs, but it is more flexible due to the use of IPs as the prior distribution over the latent functions. We describe a scalable variational inference algorithm for training DVIP and show that it outperforms previous IP-based methods and also deep GPs. We support these claims via extensive regression and classification experiments. We also evaluate DVIP on large datasets with up to several million data instances to illustrate its good scalability and performance",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a new self-supervised method, which is called denoising masked autoencoders (DMAE), for learning certified robust classifiers of images. In DMAE, we corrupt each image by adding Gaussian noises to each pixel value and randomly masking several patches. A Transformer-based encoder-decoder model is then trained to reconstruct the original image from the corrupted one. In this learning paradigm, the encoder will learn to capture relevant semantics for the downstream tasks, which is also robust to Gaussian additive noises. We show that the pre-trained encoder can naturally be used as the base classifier in Gaussian smoothed models, where we can analytically compute the certified radius for any data point. Although the proposed method is simple, it yields significant performance improvement in downstream classification tasks. We show that the DMAE ViT-Base model, which just uses 1/10 parameters of the model developed in recent work (Carlini et al., 2022), achieves competitive or better certified accuracy in various settings. The DMAE ViT-Large model significantly surpasses all previous results, establishing a new state-of-the-art on ImageNet dataset. We further demonstrate that the pre-trained model has good transferability to the CIFAR-10 dataset, suggesting its wide adaptability.

    "abstract": "Estimating conditional average treatment effects (CATEs) from observational data is relevant in many fields such as personalized medicine. However, in practice, the treatment assignment is usually confounded by unobserved variables and thus introduces bias. A remedy to remove the bias is the use of instrumental variables (IVs). Such settings are widespread in medicine (e.g., trials where the treatment assignment is used as binary IV). In this paper, we propose a novel, multiply robust machine learning framework, called MRIV, for estimating CATEs using binary IVs and thus yield an unbiased CATE estimator. Different from previous work for binary IVs, our framework estimates the CATE directly via a pseudo-outcome regression. (1)~We provide a theoretical analysis where we show that our framework yields multiple robust convergence rates: our CATE estimator achieves fast convergence even if several nuisance estimators converge slowly. (2)~We further show that our framework asymptotically outperforms state-of-the-art plug-in IV methods for CATE estimation, in the sense that it achieves a faster rate of convergence if the CATE is smoother than the individual outcome surfaces. (3)~We build upon our theoretical results and propose a tailored deep neural network architecture called MRIV-Net for CATE estimation using binary IVs. Across various computational experiments, we demonstrate empirically that our MRIV-Net achieves state-of-the-art performance. To the best of our knowledge, our MRIV is the first multiply robust machine learning framework tailored to estimating CATEs in the binary IV setting",

    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "Multivariate time series often faces the problem of missing value. Many time series imputation methods have been developed in the literature. However, these methods all rely on an entangled representation to model dynamics of time series, which may fail to fully exploit the multiple factors (e.g., periodic patterns) contained in the time series. Moreover, the entangled representation usually has no semantic meaning, and thus they often lack interpretability. In addition, many recent models are proposed to deal with the whole time series to capture cross-channel correlations and identify temporal dynamics, but they are not scalable to large-scale datasets. Different from existing approaches, we propose TIDER, a novel matrix factorization-based method with disentangled temporal representations that account for multiple factors, namely trend, seasonality, and local bias, to model complex dynamics. The learned disentanglement makes the imputation process more reliable and offers explainability for imputation results. Moreover, TIDER is scalable to large datasets. Empirical results show that our method not only outperforms existing approaches by notable margins on three real-world datasets, but also scales well to large datasets on which existing deep learning based methods struggle. Disentanglement validation experiments further demonstrate the robustness of our model in obtaining accurate and explainable disentangled components",

    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "Recently pre-trained language models (PLMs) have prospered in various natural language generation (NLG) tasks due to their ability to generate fairly fluent text. Nevertheless, these models are observed to capture and reproduce harmful contents in training corpora, typically toxic language and social biases, raising severe moral issues. Prior works on ethical NLG tackle detoxifying and debiasing separately, which is problematic since we find debiased models still exhibit toxicity while detoxified ones even exacerbate biases. To address such a challenge, we propose the first unified framework of detoxifying and debiasing called UDDIA, which jointly formalizes these two problems as rectifying the output space. We theoretically interpret our framework as learning a text distribution mixing weighted attributes. Besides, UDDIA conducts adaptive optimization of only a few parameters during decoding based on a parameter-efficient tuning schema without any training data. This leads to minimal generation quality loss and improved rectification performance with acceptable computational cost. Experimental results demonstrate that compared to several strong baselines, UDDIA achieves debiasing and detoxifying simultaneously and better balances efficiency and effectiveness, taking a further step towards practical ethical NLG",

A number of techniques have been developed for ANN search that are efficient, accurate, and scalable. However, such techniques typically have a number of parameters that affect the speed-recall tradeoff, and exhibit poor performance when such parameters aren't properly set. Tuning these parameters has traditionally been a manual process, demanding in-depth knowledge of the underlying search algorithm. This is becoming an increasingly unrealistic demand as ANN search grows in popularity. To tackle this obstacle to ANN adoption, this work proposes a constrained optimization-based approach to tuning quantization-based ANN algorithms. Our technique takes just a desired search cost or recall as input, and then generates tunings that, empirically, are very close to the speed-recall Pareto frontier and give leading performance on standard benchmarks",

However, this approach is slow and costly because it needs many forward and reverse steps. We propose a faster and cheaper approach that adds noise not until the data become pure random noise, but until they reach a hidden noisy data distribution that we can confidently learn. Then, we use fewer reverse steps to generate data by starting from this hidden distribution that is made similar to the noisy data. We reveal that the proposed model can be cast as an adversarial auto-encoder empowered by both the diffusion process and a learnable implicit prior. Experimental results show even with a significantly smaller number of reverse diffusion steps, the proposed truncated diffusion probabilistic models can provide consistent improvements over the non-truncated ones in terms of performance in both unconditional and text-guided image generations",

    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "Pruning neural networks before training has received increasing interest due to its potential to reduce training time and memory. One popular method is to prune the connections based on a certain metric, but it is not entirely clear what metric is the best choice. Recent advances in neural tangent kernel (NTK) theory suggest that the training dynamics of large enough neural networks is closely related to the spectrum of the NTK. Motivated by this finding, we propose to prune the connections that have the least influence on the spectrum of the NTK. This method can help maintain the NTK spectrum, which may help align the training dynamics to that of its dense counterpart. However, one possible issue is that the fixed-weight-NTK corresponding to a given initial point can be very different from the NTK corresponding to later iterates during the training phase. We further propose to sample multiple realizations of random weights to estimate the NTK spectrum. Note that our approach is weight-agnostic, which is different from most existing methods that are weight-dependent. In addition, we use random inputs to compute the fixed-weight-NTK, making our method data-agnostic as well. We name our foresight pruning algorithm Neural Tangent Kernel Spectrum-Aware Pruning (NTK-SAP). Empirically, our method achieves better performance than all baselines on multiple datasets",

    "title": "Effective Self-supervised Pre-training on Low-compute Networks without Distillation",
    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "Despite the impressive progress of self-supervised learning (SSL), its applicability to low-compute networks has received limited attention. Reported performance has trailed behind standard supervised pre-training by a large margin, barring self-supervised learning from making an impact on models that are deployed on device. Most prior works attribute this poor performance to the capacity bottleneck of the low-compute networks and opt to bypass the problem through the use of knowledge distillation (KD). In this work, we revisit SSL for efficient neural networks, taking a closer at what are the detrimental factors causing the practical limitations, and whether they are intrinsic to the self-supervised low-compute setting. We find that, contrary to accepted knowledge, there is no intrinsic architectural bottleneck, we diagnose that the performance bottleneck is related to the model complexity vs regularization strength trade-off. In particular, we start by empirically observing that the use of local views can have a dramatic impact on the effectiveness of the SSL methods. This hints at view sampling being one of the performance bottlenecks for SSL on low-capacity networks. We hypothesize that the view sampling strategy for large neural networks, which requires matching views in very diverse spatial scales and contexts, is too demanding for low-capacity architectures. We systematize the design of the view sampling mechanism, leading to a new training methodology that consistently improves the performance across different SSL methods (e.g. MoCo-v2, SwAV or DINO), different low-size networks (convolution-based networks, e.g. MobileNetV2, ResNet18, ResNet34 and vision transformer, e.g. ViT-Ti), and different tasks (linear probe, object detection, instance segmentation and semi-supervised learning). Our best models establish new state-of-the-art for SSL methods on low-compute networks despite not using a KD loss term. Code is publicly available at github.com/saic-fi/SSLight",

    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "Recent advancements in explainable machine learning provide effective and faithful solutions for interpreting model behaviors. However, many explanation methods encounter efficiency issues, which largely limit their deployments in practical scenarios. Real-time explainer (RTX) frameworks have thus been proposed to accelerate the model explanation process by learning an one-feed-forward explainer. Existing RTX frameworks typically build the explainer under the supervised learning paradigm, which requires large amounts of explanation labels as the ground truth. Considering that accurate explanation labels are usually hard to obtain, due to constrained computational resources and limited human efforts, effective explainer training is still challenging in practice. In this work, we propose a COntrastive Real-Time eXplanation (CoRTX) framework to learn the explanation-oriented representation and relieve the intensive dependence of explainer training on explanation labels. Specifically, we design a synthetic strategy to select positive and negative instances for explanation representation learning. Theoretical analysis show that our selection strategy can benefit the contrastive learning process on explanation tasks. Experimental results on three real-world datasets further demonstrate the efficiency and efficacy of our proposed CoRTX framework",

    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "The existing model compression methods via structured pruning typically require complicated multi-stage procedures. Each individual stage necessitates numerous engineering efforts and domain-knowledge from the end-users which prevent their wider applications onto broader scenarios. We propose the second generation of Only-Train-Once (OTOv2), which first automatically trains and compresses a general DNN only once from scratch to produce a more compact model with competitive performance without fine-tuning. OTOv2 is automatic and pluggable into various deep learning applications, and requires almost minimal engineering efforts from the users. Methodologically, OTOv2 proposes two major improvements: (i) Autonomy: automatically exploits the dependency of general DNNs, partitions the trainable variables into Zero-Invariant Groups (ZIGs), and constructs the compressed model; and (ii) Dual Half-Space Projected Gradient (DHSPG): a novel optimizer to more reliably solve structured-sparsity problems. Numerically, we demonstrate the generality and autonomy of OTOv2 on a variety of model architectures such as VGG, ResNet, CARN, ConvNeXt, DenseNet and StackedUnets, the majority of which cannot be handled by other methods without extensive handcrafting efforts. Together with benchmark datasets including CIFAR10/100, DIV2K, Fashion-MNIST, SVNH and ImageNet, its effectiveness is validated by performing competitively or even better than the state-of-the-arts.

    "abstract": "In this paper, we systematically study the audio-visual speech separation task in a multi-speaker scenario. Given the facial information of each speaker, the goal of this task is to separate the corresponding speech from the mixed speech. The existing works are designed for speech separation in a controlled setting with a fixed number of speakers (mostly 2 or 3 speakers), which seems to be impractical for real applications. As a result, we try to utilize a single model to separate the voices with a variable number of speakers. Based on the observation, there are two prominent issues for multi-speaker separation: 1) There are some noisy voice pieces belonging to other speakers in the separation results; 2) Part of the target speech is missing after separation. Accordingly, we propose \\textbf{BFRNet}, including a {\\bf B}asic audio-visual speech separator and a Filter-Recovery Network (\\textbf{FRNet}). FRNet can refine the coarse audio separated by basic audio-visual speech separator. To have fair comparisons, we build a comprehensive benchmark for multi-speaker audio-visual speech separation to verify the performance of various methods. Experimental results show that our method is able to achieve the state-of-the-art performance. Furthermore, we also find that FRNet can boost the performance of other off-the-shelf speech separators, which exhibits its ability of generalization",

We introduce a way to induce prompts by mixing language models at training time that results in prompts that generalize well across models. We conduct an extensive analysis of the induced prompts, finding that the more general prompts include a larger proportion of existing English words and have a less order-dependent and more uniform distribution of information across their component tokens. Our work provides preliminary evidence that it's possible to generate discrete prompts that can be induced once and used with a number of different models, and gives insights on the properties characterizing such prompts",

By analyzing this generating function, we find, in particular, that 1) the SGD dynamics exhibits several convergent and divergent regimes depending on the spectral distributions of the problem; 2) the convergent regimes admit explicit stability conditions, and explicit loss asymptotics in the case of power-law spectral distributions; 3) the optimal convergence rate can be achieved at negative momenta. We verify our theoretical predictions by extensive experiments with MNIST and synthetic problems, and find a good quantitative agreement",

    "title": "Bridging the Gap between ANNs and SNNs by Calibrating Offset Spikes",
    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have attracted great attention due to their distinctive characteristics of low power consumption and temporal information processing. ANN-SNN conversion, as the most commonly used training method for applying SNNs, can ensure that converted SNNs achieve comparable performance to ANNs on large-scale datasets. However, the performance degrades severely under low quantities of time-steps, which hampers the practical applications of SNNs to neuromorphic chips. In this paper, instead of evaluating different conversion errors and then eliminating these errors, we define an offset spike to measure the degree of deviation between actual and desired SNN firing rates. We perform a detailed analysis of offset spike and note that the firing of one additional (or one less) spike is the main cause of conversion errors. Based on this, we propose an optimization strategy based on shifting the initial membrane potential and we theoretically prove the corresponding optimal shifting distance for calibrating the spike. In addition, we also note that our method has a unique iterative property that enables further reduction of conversion errors. The experimental results show that our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet datasets. For example, we reach a top-1 accuracy of 67.12% on ImageNet when using 6 time-steps. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time an ANN-SNN conversion has been shown to simultaneously achieve high accuracy and ultralow latency on complex datasets.

    "title": "ESD: Expected Squared Difference as a Tuning-Free Trainable Calibration Measure",
    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "Studies have shown that modern neural networks tend to be poorly calibrated due to over-confident predictions. Traditionally, post-processing methods have been used to calibrate the model after training. In recent years, various trainable calibration measures have been proposed to incorporate them directly into the training process. However, these methods all incorporate internal hyperparameters, and the performance of these calibration objectives relies on tuning these hyperparameters, incurring more computational costs as the size of neural networks and datasets become larger. As such, we present Expected Squared Difference (ESD), a tuning-free (i.e., hyperparameter-free) trainable calibration objective loss, where we view the calibration error from the perspective of the squared difference between the two expectations. With extensive experiments on several architectures (CNNs, Transformers) and datasets, we demonstrate that (1) incorporating ESD into the training improves model calibration in various batch size settings without the need for internal hyperparameter tuning, (2) ESD yields the best-calibrated results compared with previous approaches, and (3) ESD drastically improves the computational costs required for calibration during training due to the absence of internal hyperparameter.

A new flexible framework that allows users to pick certain regions of the background image and use it to guide the harmonization is proposed. Inspired by professional portrait harmonization users, we also introduce a new luminance matching loss to optimally match the color/luminance conditions between the composite foreground and select reference region. This framework provides more control to the image harmonization pipeline achieving visually pleasing portrait edits. Furthermore, we also introduce a new dataset carefully curated for validating portrait harmonization.

    "abstract": "Pre-training a large transformer model on a massive amount of unlabeled data and fine-tuning it on labeled datasets for diverse downstream tasks has proven to be a successful strategy, for a variety of vision and natural language processing tasks. However, direct fine-tuning of the pre-trained model may be suboptimal if there exist large discrepancies across data domains for pre-training and fine-tuning. To tackle this issue, several previous studies have proposed further pre-training strategies, where we continue to pre-train the model on the target unlabeled dataset before fine-tuning. However, all of them solely focus on language models and we empirically find that a Vision Transformer is vulnerable to overfitting as we continue to pretrain the model on target unlabeled data. In order to tackle this limitation, we propose self-distillation as a regularization for a further pre-training stage. Specifically, we first further pre-train the initial pre-trained model on the target unlabeled data and then consider it as a teacher for self-distillation. Then we take the same initial pre-trained model as a student and enforce its hidden representations to be close to those of the teacher while optimizing the student with a masked auto-encoding objective. We empirically validate the efficacy of self-distillation on a variety of benchmark datasets for image and text classification tasks. Experimentally, we show that our proposed method outperforms all the relevant baselines. Theoretically, we analyze the proposed method with a simplified model to understand how self-distillation for further pre-training can potentially help improve the performance of the downstream tasks",

    "abstract": "This paper presents a new Convolutional Neural Network, named Contextual Convolutional Network, that capably serves as a general-purpose backbone for visual recognition. Most existing convolutional backbones follow the representation-to-classification paradigm, where representations of the input are firstly generated by category-agnostic convolutional operations, and then fed into classifiers for specific perceptual tasks (e.g., classification and segmentation). In this paper, we deviate from this classic paradigm and propose to augment potential category memberships as contextual priors in the convolution for contextualized representation learning. Specifically, top-k likely classes from the preceding stage are encoded as a contextual prior vector. Based on this vector and the preceding features, offsets for spatial sampling locations and kernel weights are generated to modulate the convolution operations. The new convolutions can readily replace their plain counterparts in existing CNNs and can be easily trained end-to-end by standard back-propagation without additional supervision. The qualities of Contextual Convolutional Networks make it compatible with a broad range of vision tasks and boost the state-of-the-art architecture ConvNeXt-Tiny by 1.8% on top-1 accuracy of ImageNet classification.

They have been widely use in fair resource allocation of food/blood donations and budget management in large-scale Internet ad auctions. In resource allocation, it is crucial to quantify the variability of the resource received by the agents (such as blood banks and food banks) in addition to fairness and efficiency properties of the systems. For ad auction markets, it is important to establish statistical properties of the platform's revenues in addition to their expected values. To this end, we propose a statistical framework based on the concept of infinite-dimensional Fisher markets. In our framework, we observe a market formed by a finite number of items sampled from an underlying distribution (the ``observed market'') and aim to infer several important equilibrium quantities of the underlying long-run market. These equilibrium quantities include individual utilities, social welfare, and pacing multipliers. Through the lens of sample average approximation (SSA), we derive a collection of statistical results and show that the observed market provides useful statistical information of the long-run market. In other words, the equilibrium quantities of the observed market converge to the true ones of the long-run market with strong statistical guarantees. These include consistency, finite sample bounds, asymptotics, and confidence. As an extension, we discuss revenue inference in quasilinear Fisher markets",

Scenarios commonly include multiple properties of users, such as age, employment status, and income level for the question \"How much can I claim from this benefit\". The properties relevant to a potential answer are given in a document, which will state conditions necessary for the answer to hold. Documents also may specify how conditions interact with each other, e.g. with text like \"one of the conditions below must apply\". Although understanding the relationship between conditions is crucial for solving this challenging QA task, limited work has been done so far in modeling this. In this paper, we propose the T-Reasoner model, which solves this problem with three jointly learned modules: an entailment module which checks whether a condition has been satisfied by the scenario, a decoding module which locates eligible answers from documents, and a reasoning module which infers the relationship between conditions and performs a reasoning step to determine the logically consistent answers and identify missing conditions. T-Reasoner outperforms strong baselines on a synthetic scenario-based QA dataset and achieves a new state-of-the-art on two scenario-based QA benchmarks, outperforming the prior best models by 3-10 points",

    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "For long-tailed classification tasks, most works often pretrain a big model on a large-scale (unlabeled) dataset, and then fine-tune the whole pretrained model for adapting to long-tailed data. Though promising, fine-tuning the whole pretrained model tends to suffer from high cost in computation and deployment of different models for different tasks, as well as weakened generalization capability for overfitting to certain features of long-tailed data. To alleviate these issues, we propose an effective Long-tailed Prompt Tuning (LPT) method for long-tailed classification tasks. LPT introduces several trainable prompts into a frozen pretrained model to adapt it to long-tailed data. For better effectiveness, we divide prompts into two groups: 1) a shared prompt for the whole long-tailed dataset to learn general features and to adapt a pretrained model into the target long-tailed domain; and 2) group-specific prompts to gather group-specific features for the samples which have similar features and also to empower the pretrained model with fine-grained discrimination ability. Then we design a two-phase training paradigm to learn these prompts. In the first phase, we train the shared prompt via conventional supervised prompt tuning to adapt a pretrained model to the desired long-tailed domain. In the second phase, we use the learnt shared prompt as query to select a small best matched set for a group of similar samples from the group-specific prompt set to dig the common features of these similar samples, and then optimize these prompts with a dual sampling strategy and the asymmetric Gaussian Clouded Logit loss. By only fine-tuning a few prompts while fixing the pretrained model, LPT can reduce training cost and deployment cost by storing a few prompts, and enjoys a strong generalization ability of the pretrained model. Experiments show that on various long-tailed benchmarks, with only $\\sim$1.1\\% extra trainable parameters, LPT achieves comparable or higher performance than previous whole model fine-tuning methods, and is more robust to domain-shift",

    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "Face detection (FD) has achieved remarkable success over the past few years, yet, these leaps often arrive when consuming enormous computation costs. Moreover, when considering a realistic situation, i.e., building a lightweight face detector under a computation-scarce scenario, such heavy computation cost limits the application of the face detector. To remedy this, several pioneering works design tiny face detectors through off-the-shelf neural architecture search (NAS) technologies, which are usually applied to the classification task. Thus, the searched architectures are sub-optimal for the face detection task since some design criteria between detection and classification task are different. As a representative, the face detection backbone design needs to guarantee the stage-level detection ability while it is not required for the classification backbone. Furthermore, the detection backbone consumes a vast body of inference budgets in the whole detection framework. Considering the intrinsic design requirement and the virtual importance role of the face detection backbone, we thus ask a critical question: How to employ NAS to search FD-friendly backbone architecture? To cope with this question, we propose a distribution-dependent stage-aware ranking score (DDSAR-Score) to explicitly characterize the stage-level expressivity and identify the individual importance of each stage, thus satisfying the aforementioned design criterion of the FD backbone. Based on our proposed DDSAR-Score, we conduct comprehensive experiments on the challenging Wider Face benchmark dataset and achieve dominant performance across a wide range of compute regimes. In particular, compared to the tiniest face detector SCRFD-0.5GF, our method is +2.5 % better in Average Precision (AP) score when using the same amount of FLOPs.

    "abstract": "Motion mimicking is a foundational task in physics-based character animation. However, most existing motion mimicking methods are built upon reinforcement learning (RL) and suffer from heavy reward engineering, high variance, and slow convergence with hard explorations. Specifically, they usually take tens of hours or even days of training to mimic a simple motion sequence, resulting in poor scalability. In this work, we leverage differentiable physics simulators (DPS) and propose an efficient motion mimicking method dubbed $\\textbf{DiffMimic}$. Our key insight is that DPS casts a complex policy learning task to a much simpler state matching problem. In particular, DPS learns a stable policy by analytical gradients with ground-truth physical priors hence leading to significantly faster and stabler convergence than RL-based methods. Moreover, to escape from local optima, we utilize an \\textit{Demonstration Replay} mechanism to enable stable gradient backpropagation in a long horizon. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks show that DiffMimic has a better sample efficiency and time efficiency than existing methods (e.g., DeepMimic). Notably, DiffMimic allows a physically simulated character to learn back-flip after 10 minutes of training and be able to cycle it after 3 hours of training, while DeepMimic requires about a day of training to cycle back-flip. More importantly, we hope DiffMimic can benefit more differentiable animation systems with techniques like differentiable clothes simulation in future research.

Current tendencies to remove noise in order to enforce reproducibility of research results neglect inherent nondeterminism at the implementation level and disregard crucial interaction effects between algorithmic noise factors and data properties. This limits the scope of conclusions that can be drawn from such experiments. Instead of removing noise, we propose to incorporate several sources of variance, including their interaction with data properties, into an analysis of significance and reliability of machine learning evaluation, with the aim to draw inferences beyond particular instances of trained models. We show how to use linear mixed effects models (LMEMs) to analyze performance evaluation scores, and to conduct statistical inference with a generalized likelihood ratio test (GLRT). This allows us to incorporate arbitrary sources of noise like meta-parameter variations into statistical significance testing, and to assess performance differences conditional on data properties. Furthermore, a variance component analysis (VCA) enables the analysis of the contribution of noise sources to overall variance and the computation of a reliability coefficient by the ratio of substantial to total variance",

Most of the existing works design an explicit degradation estimator for each degradation to guide SR. However, it is infeasible to provide concrete labels of multiple degradation combinations (\\eg, blur, noise, jpeg compression) to supervise the degradation estimator training. In addition, these special designs for certain degradation, such as blur, impedes the models from being generalized to handle different degradations. To this end, it is necessary to design an implicit degradation estimator that can extract discriminative degradation representation for all degradations without relying on the supervision of degradation ground-truth. In this paper, we propose a Knowledge Distillation based Blind-SR network (KDSR). It consists of a knowledge distillation based implicit degradation estimator network (KD-IDE) and an efficient SR network. To learn the KDSR model, we first train a teacher network: KD-IDE$_{T}$. It takes paired HR and LR patches as inputs and is optimized with the SR network jointly. Then, we further train a student network KD-IDE$_{S}$, which only takes LR images as input and learns to extract the same implicit degradation representation (IDR) as KD-IDE$_{T}$. In addition, to fully use extracted IDR, we design a simple, strong, and efficient IDR based dynamic convolution residual block (IDR-DCRB) to build an SR network. We conduct extensive experiments under classic and real-world degradation settings. The results show that KDSR achieves SOTA performance and can generalize to various degradation processes.

In this paper, we propose a graph contrastive learning framework for skeleton-based action recognition ($\\textit{SkeletonGCL}$) to explore the $\\textit{global}$ context across all sequences. In specific, SkeletonGCL associates graph learning across sequences by enforcing graphs to be class-discriminative, i.e., intra-class compact and inter-class dispersed, which improves the GCN capacity to distinguish various action patterns. Besides, two memory banks are designed to enrich cross-sequence context from two complementary levels, i.e., instance and semantic levels, enabling graph contrastive learning in multiple context scales. Consequently, SkeletonGCL establishes a new training paradigm, and it can be seamlessly incorporated into current GCNs.

Different from previous one-stage methods, ED-Pose re-considers this task as two explicit box detection processes with a unified representation and regression supervision. First, we introduce a human detection decoder from encoded tokens to extract global features. It can provide a good initialization for the latter keypoint detection, making the training process converge fast. Second, to bring in contextual information near keypoints, we regard pose estimation as a keypoint box detection problem to learn both box positions and contents for each keypoint. A human-to-keypoint detection decoder adopts an interactive learning strategy between human and keypoint features to further enhance global and local feature aggregation. In general, ED-Pose is conceptually simple without post-processing and dense heatmap supervision. It demonstrates its effectiveness and efficiency compared with both two-stage and one-stage methods. Notably, explicit box detection boosts the pose estimation performance by 4.5 AP on COCO and 9.9 AP on CrowdPose.

The former offers an energy-efficient and event-driven paradigm for deep learning, while the latter has the ability to capture feature dependencies, enabling Transformer to achieve good performance. It is intuitively promising to explore the marriage between them. In this paper, we consider leveraging both self-attention capability and biological properties of SNNs, and propose a novel Spiking Self Attention (SSA) as well as a powerful framework, named Spiking Transformer (Spikformer). The SSA mechanism in Spikformer models the sparse visual feature by using spike-form Query, Key, and Value without softmax. Since its computation is sparse and avoids multiplication, SSA is efficient and has low computational energy consumption. It is shown that Spikformer with SSA can outperform the state-of-the-art SNNs-like frameworks in image classification on both neuromorphic and static datasets. Spikformer (66.3M parameters) with comparable size to SEW-ResNet-152 (60.2M,69.26%) can achieve 74.81% top1 accuracy on ImageNet using 4 time steps, which is the state-of-the-art in directly trained SNNs models.

    "title": "Multimodal Analogical Reasoning over Knowledge Graphs",
    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "Analogical reasoning is fundamental to human cognition and holds an important place in various fields. However, previous studies mainly focus on single-modal analogical reasoning and ignore taking advantage of structure knowledge. Notably, the research in cognitive psychology has demonstrated that information from multimodal sources always brings more powerful cognitive transfer than single modality sources. To this end, we introduce the new task of multimodal analogical reasoning over knowledge graphs, which requires multimodal reasoning ability with the help of background knowledge. Specifically, we construct a Multimodal Analogical Reasoning dataSet (MARS) and a multimodal knowledge graph MarKG. We evaluate with multimodal knowledge graph embedding and pre-trained Transformer baselines, illustrating the potential challenges of the proposed task. We further propose a novel model-agnostic Multimodal analogical reasoning framework with Transformer (MarT) motivated by the structure mapping theory, which can obtain better performance. We hope our work can deliver benefits and inspire future research. Code and datasets are available in https://github.com/zjunlp/MKG_Analogy",

    "title": "MECTA: Memory-Economic Continual Test-Time Model Adaptation",
    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "Continual Test-time Adaptation (CTA) is a promising art to secure accuracy gains in continually-changing environments. The state-of-the-art adaptations improve out-of-distribution model accuracy via computation-efficient online test-time gradient descents but meanwhile cost about times of memory versus the inference, even if only a small portion of parameters are updated. Such high memory consumption of CTA substantially impedes wide applications of advanced CTA on memory-constrained devices. In this paper, we provide a novel solution, dubbed MECTA, to drastically improve the memory efficiency of gradient-based CTA. Our profiling shows that the major memory overhead comes from the intermediate cache for back-propagation, which scales by the batch size, channel, and layer number. Therefore, we propose to reduce batch sizes, adopt an adaptive normalization layer to maintain stable and accurate predictions, and stop the back-propagation caching heuristically. On the other hand, we prune the networks to reduce the computation and memory overheads in optimization and recover the parameters afterward to avoid forgetting. The proposed MECTA is efficient and can be seamlessly plugged into state-of-the-art CTA algorithms at negligible overhead on computation and memory. On three datasets, CIFAR10, CIFAR100, and ImageNet, MECTA improves the accuracy by at least 6% with constrained memory and significantly reduces the memory costs of ResNet50 on ImageNet by at least 70% with comparable accuracy.

    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "Generalizable manipulation skills, which can be composed to tackle long-horizon and complex daily chores, are one of the cornerstones of Embodied AI. However, existing benchmarks, mostly composed of a suite of simulatable environments, are insufficient to push cutting-edge research works because they lack object-level topological and geometric variations, are not based on fully dynamic simulation, or are short of native support for multiple types of manipulation tasks. To this end, we present ManiSkill2, the next generation of the SAPIEN ManiSkill benchmark, to address critical pain points often encountered by researchers when using benchmarks for generalizable manipulation skills. ManiSkill2 includes 20 manipulation task families with 2000+ object models and 4M+ demonstration frames, which cover stationary/mobile-base, single/dual-arm, and rigid/soft-body manipulation tasks with 2D/3D-input data simulated by fully dynamic engines. It defines a unified interface and evaluation protocol to support a wide range of algorithms (e.g., classic sense-plan-act, RL, IL), visual observations (point cloud, RGBD), and controllers (e.g., action type and parameterization). Moreover, it empowers fast visual input learning algorithms so that a CNN-based policy can collect samples at about 2000 FPS with 1 GPU and 16 processes on a regular workstation. It implements a render server infrastructure to allow sharing rendering resources across all environments, thereby significantly reducing memory usage. We open-source all codes of our benchmark (simulator, environments, and baselines) and host an online challenge open to interdisciplinary researchers",

    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "Graph matching (GM) has been a building block in various areas including computer vision and pattern recognition. Despite recent impressive progress, existing deep GM methods often have obvious difficulty in handling outliers, which are ubiquitous in practice. We propose a deep reinforcement learning based approach RGM, whose sequential node matching scheme naturally fits the strategy for selective inlier matching against outliers. A revocable action framework is devised to improve the agent's flexibility against the complex constrained GM. Moreover, we propose a quadratic approximation technique to regularize the affinity score, in the presence of outliers. As such, the agent can finish inlier matching timely when the affinity score stops growing, for which otherwise an additional parameter i.e. the number of inliers is needed to avoid matching outliers. In this paper, we focus on learning the back-end solver under the most general form of GM: the Lawler's QAP, whose input is the affinity matrix. Especially, our approach can also boost existing GM methods that use such input. Experiments on multiple real-world datasets demonstrate its performance regarding both accuracy and robustness",

    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "Reward function is essential in reinforcement learning (RL), serving as the guiding signal to incentivize agents to solve given tasks, however, is also notoriously difficult to design. In many cases, only imperfect rewards are available, which inflicts substantial performance loss for RL agents. In this study, we propose a unified offline policy optimization approach, \\textit{RGM (Reward Gap Minimization)}, which can smartly handle diverse types of imperfect rewards. RGM is formulated as a bi-level optimization problem: the upper layer optimizes a reward correction term that performs visitation distribution matching w.r.t. some expert data; the lower layer solves a pessimistic RL problem with the corrected rewards. By exploiting the duality of the lower layer, we derive a tractable algorithm that enables sampled-based learning without any online interactions. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that RGM achieves superior performance to existing methods under diverse settings of imperfect rewards. Further, RGM can effectively correct wrong or inconsistent rewards against expert preference and retrieve useful information from biased rewards.

Existing methods suffer from overly pessimistic modeling with low generalization confidence. As generalizing to arbitrary test distributions is impossible, we hypothesize that further structure on the topology of distributions is crucial in developing strong OOD resilience. To this end, we propose topology-aware robust optimization (TRO) that seamlessly integrates distributional topology in a principled optimization framework. More specifically, TRO solves two optimization objectives: (1) Topology Learning which explores data manifold to uncover the distributional topology; (2) Learning on Topology which exploits the topology to constrain robust optimization for tightly-bounded generalization risks. We theoretically demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, and empirically show that it significantly outperforms the state of the arts in a wide range of tasks including classification, regression, and semantic segmentation. Moreover, we empirically find the data-driven distributional topology is consistent with domain knowledge, enhancing the explainability of our approach",

We first analyze those existing extraction solutions either fail to maintain the model accuracy or model robustness or lead to the robust overfitting issue. Then we propose Boundary Entropy Searching Thief (BEST), a novel model extraction attack to achieve both accuracy and robustness extraction under restricted attack budgets. BEST generates a new kind of uncertain examples for querying and reconstructing the victim model. These samples have uniform confidence scores across different classes, which can perfectly balance the trade-off between model accuracy and robustness. Extensive experiments demonstrate that BEST outperforms existing attack methods over different datasets and model architectures under limited data.

To address these challenges and expand the coverage of KGs, few-shot KG completion aims to make predictions for triplets involving novel relations when only a few training triplets are provided as reference. Previous methods have focused on designing local neighbor aggregators to learn entity-level information and/or imposing sequential dependency assumption at the triplet level to learn meta relation information. However, pairwise triplet-level interactions and context-level relational information have been largely overlooked for learning meta representations of few-shot relations. In this paper, we propose a hierarchical relational learning method (HiRe) for few-shot KG completion. By jointly capturing three levels of relational information (entity-level, triplet-level and context-level), HiRe can effectively learn and refine the meta representation of few-shot relations, and consequently generalize well to new unseen relations. Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets validate the superiority of HiRe over state-of-the-art methods. The code of HiRe can be found in supplementary material and will be released after acceptance",

    "title": "Function-Consistent Feature Distillation",
    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "Feature distillation makes the student mimic the intermediate features of the teacher. Nearly all existing feature-distillation methods use L2 distance or its slight variants as the distance metric between teacher and student features. However, while L2 distance is isotropic w.r.t. all dimensions, the neural network's operation on different dimensions is usually anisotropic, i.e., perturbations with the same 2-norm but in different dimensions of intermediate features lead to changes in the final output with largely different magnitude. Considering this, we argue that the similarity between teacher and student features should \\textit{not} be measured merely based on their appearance (i.e., L2 distance), but should, more importantly, be measured by their difference in function, namely how later layers of the network will read, decode, and process them. Therefore, we propose Function-Consistent Feature Distillation (FCFD), which explicitly optimizes the functional similarity between teacher and student features. The core idea of FCFD is to make teacher and student features not only numerically similar, but more importantly produce similar outputs when fed to the later part of the same network. With FCFD, the student mimics the teacher more faithfully and learns more from the teacher. Extensive experiments on image classification and object detection demonstrate the superiority of FCFD to existing methods. Furthermore, we can combine FCFD with many existing methods to obtain even higher accuracy. Our codes are available at https://github.com/LiuDongyang6/FCFD",

    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "Open-set Recognition (OSR) aims to identify test samples whose classes are not seen during the training process. Recently, Unified Open-set Recognition (UOSR) has been proposed to reject not only unknown samples but also known but wrongly classified samples, which tends to be more practical in real-world applications. In this paper, we deeply analyze the UOSR task under different training and evaluation settings to shed light on this promising research direction. For this purpose, we first evaluate the UOSR performance of several OSR methods and show a significant finding that the uncertainty distribution of almost all these methods is actually closer to the expectation of UOSR than OSR. We show that the reason lies in the known but wrongly classified samples, as their uncertainty distribution is extremely close to unknown samples rather than known and correctly classified samples. Second, we analyze how the two training settings of OSR (i.e., pre-training and outlier exposure) influence the UOSR. We find although they are both beneficial for distinguishing known and correctly classified samples from unknown samples, pre-training is also helpful for identifying known but wrongly classified samples while outlier exposure is not. In addition to different training settings, we also formulate a new evaluation setting for UOSR which is called few-shot UOSR, where only one or five samples per unknown class are available during evaluation to help identify unknown samples. We propose FS-KNNS for the few-shot UOSR to achieve state-of-the-art performance under all settings",

    "title": "Fairness-aware Contrastive Learning with Partially Annotated Sensitive Attributes",
    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "Learning high-quality representation is important and essential for visual recognition. Unfortunately, traditional representation learning suffers from fairness issues since the model may learn information of sensitive attributes. Recently, a series of studies have been proposed to improve fairness by explicitly decorrelating target labels and sensitive attributes. Most of these methods, however, rely on the assumption that fully annotated labels on target variable and sensitive attributes are available, which is unrealistic due to the expensive annotation cost. In this paper, we investigate a novel and practical problem of Fair Unsupervised Representation Learning with Partially annotated Sensitive labels (FURL-PS). FURL-PS has two key challenges: 1) how to make full use of the samples that are not annotated with sensitive attributes; 2) how to eliminate bias in the dataset without target labels. To address these challenges, we propose a general Fairness-aware Contrastive Learning (FairCL) framework consisting of two stages. Firstly, we generate contrastive sample pairs, which share the same visual information apart from sensitive attributes, for each instance in the original dataset. In this way, we construct a balanced and unbiased dataset. Then, we execute fair contrastive learning by closing the distance between representations of contrastive sample pairs. Besides, we also propose an unsupervised way to balance the utility and fairness of learned representations by feature reweighting. Extensive experimental results illustrate the effectiveness of our method in terms of fairness and utility, even with very limited sensitive attributes and serious data bias",

    "title": "Dilated convolution with learnable spacings",
    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "Recent works indicate that convolutional neural networks (CNN) need large receptive fields (RF) to compete with visual transformers and their attention mechanism. In CNNs, RFs can simply be enlarged by increasing the convolution kernel sizes. Yet the number of trainable parameters, which scales quadratically with the kernel's size in the 2D case, rapidly becomes prohibitive, and the training is notoriously difficult. This paper presents a new method to increase the RF size without increasing the number of parameters. The dilated convolution (DC) has already been proposed for the same purpose. DC can be seen as a convolution with a kernel that contains only a few non-zero elements placed on a regular grid. Here we present a new version of the DC in which the spacings between the non-zero elements, or equivalently their positions, are no longer fixed but learnable via backpropagation thanks to an interpolation technique. We call this method \"Dilated Convolution with Learnable Spacings\" (DCLS) and generalize it to the n-dimensional convolution case. However, our main focus here will be on the 2D case. We first tried our approach on ResNet50: we drop-in replaced the standard convolutions with DCLS ones, which increased the accuracy of ImageNet1k classification at iso-parameters, but at the expense of the throughput. Next, we used the recent ConvNeXt state-of-the-art convolutional architecture and drop-in replaced the depthwise convolutions with DCLS ones. This not only increased the accuracy of ImageNet1k classification but also of typical downstream and robustness tasks, again at iso-parameters but this time with negligible cost on throughput, as ConvNeXt uses separable convolutions. Conversely, classic DC led to poor performance with both ResNet50 and ConvNeXt.

    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "High-quality instance segmentation has shown emerging importance in computer vision. Without any refinement, DCT-Mask directly generates high-resolution masks by compressed vectors. To further refine masks obtained by compressed vectors, we propose for the first time a compressed vector based multi-stage refinement framework. However, the vanilla combination does not bring significant gains, because changes in some elements of the DCT vector will affect the prediction of the entire mask. Thus, we propose a simple and novel method named PatchDCT, which separates the mask decoded from a DCT vector into several patches and refines each patch by the designed classifier and regressor. Specifically, the classifier is used to distinguish mixed patches from all patches, and to correct previously mispredicted foreground and background patches. In contrast, the regressor is used for DCT vector prediction of mixed patches, further refining the segmentation quality at boundary locations. Experiments on COCO show that our method achieves 2.0\\%, 3.2\\%, 4.5\\% AP and 3.4\\%, 5.3\\%, 7.0\\% Boundary AP improvements over Mask-RCNN on COCO, LVIS, and Cityscapes, respectively.

Such strictly-ordered discrete factorization however falls short of capturing key properties of chirographic data -- it fails to build holistic understanding of the temporal concept due to one-way visibility (causality). Consequently, temporal data has been modelled as discrete token sequences of fixed sampling rate instead of capturing the true underlying concept. In this paper, we introduce a powerful model-class namely Denoising\\ Diffusion\\ Probabilistic\\ Models or DDPMs for chirographic data that specifically addresses these flaws. Our model named \"ChiroDiff\", being non-autoregressive, learns to capture holistic concepts and therefore remains resilient to higher temporal sampling rate up to a good extent. Moreover, we show that many important downstream utilities (e.g. conditional sampling, creative mixing) can be flexibly implemented using ChiroDiff. We further show some unique use-cases like stochastic vectorization, de-noising/healing, abstraction are also possible with this model-class. We perform quantitative and qualitative evaluation of our framework on relevant datasets and found it to be better or on par with competing approaches",

    "abstract": "The conventional few-shot classification aims at learning a model on a large labeled base dataset and rapidly adapting to a target dataset that is from the same distribution as the base dataset. However, in practice, the base and the target datasets of few-shot classification are usually from different domains, which is the problem of cross-domain few-shot classification. We tackle this problem by making a small proportion of unlabeled images in the target domain accessible in the training stage. In this setup, even though the base data are sufficient and labeled, the large domain shift still makes transferring the knowledge from the base dataset difficult. We meticulously design a cross-level knowledge distillation method, which can strengthen the ability of the model to extract more discriminative features in the target dataset by guiding the network's shallow layers to learn higher-level information. Furthermore, in order to alleviate the overfitting in the evaluation stage, we propose a feature denoising operation which can reduce the feature redundancy and mitigate overfitting. Our approach can surpass the previous state-of-the-art method, Dynamic-Distillation, by 5.44% on 1-shot and 1.37% on 5-shot classification tasks on average in the BSCD-FSL benchmark.

    "abstract": "Fully test-time adaptation aims at adapting a pre-trained model to the test stream during real-time inference, which is urgently required when the test distribution differs from the training distribution. Several efforts have been devoted to improving adaptation performance. However, we find that two unfavorable defects are concealed in the prevalent adaptation methodologies like test-time batch normalization (BN) and self-learning. First, we reveal that the normalization statistics in test-time BN are completely affected by the currently received test samples, resulting in inaccurate estimates. Second, we show that during test-time adaptation, the parameter update is biased towards some dominant classes. In addition to the extensively studied test stream with independent and class-balanced samples, we further observe that the defects can be exacerbated in more complicated test environments, such as (time) dependent or class-imbalanced data. We observe that previous approaches work well in certain scenarios while show performance degradation in others due to their faults. In this paper, we provide a plug-in solution called DELTA for Degradation-freE fuLly Test-time Adaptation, which consists of two components: (i) Test-time Batch Renormalization (TBR), introduced to improve the estimated normalization statistics. (ii) Dynamic Online re-weighTing (DOT), designed to address the class bias within optimization.

We find the relation between different joints is important with two-fold impact: 1) on the one hand, some relation is consistent across all the species and may help two joints mutually confirm each other, e.g., the eyes help confirm the nose and vice versa because they are close in all species. 2) on the other hand, some relation is inconsistent for different species due to the species variation and may bring severe distraction rather than benefit. With these two insights, we propose a Decompose-to-Generalize (D-Gen) pose estimation method to break the inconsistent relations while preserving the consistent ones. Specifically, D-Gen first decomposes the body joints into several joint concepts so that each concept contains multiple closely-related joints. Given these joint concepts, D-Gen 1) promotes the interaction between intra-concept joints to enhance their reliable mutual confirmation, and 2) suppresses the interaction between inter-concept joints to prohibit their mutual distraction. Importantly, we explore various decomposition approaches, i.e., heuristic, geometric and attention-based approaches. Experimental results show that all these decomposition manners yield reasonable joint concepts and substantially improve cross-species generalization (and the attention-based approach is the best)",

    "abstract": "Many recent works have shown trainability plays a central role in neural network pruning -- unattended broken trainability can lead to severe under-performance and unintentionally amplify the effect of retraining learning rate, resulting in biased (or even misinterpreted) benchmark results. This paper introduces trainability preserving pruning (TPP), a scalable method to preserve network trainability against pruning, aiming for improved pruning performance and being more robust to retraining hyper-parameters (e.g., learning rate). Specifically, we propose to penalize the gram matrix of convolutional filters to decorrelate the pruned filters from the retained filters. In addition to the convolutional layers, per the spirit of preserving the trainability of the whole network, we also propose to regularize the batch normalization parameters (scale and bias). Empirical studies on linear MLP networks show that TPP can perform on par with the oracle trainability recovery scheme. On nonlinear ConvNets (ResNet56/VGG19) on CIFAR10/100, TPP outperforms the other counterpart approaches by an obvious margin. Moreover, results on ImageNet-1K with ResNets suggest that TPP consistently performs more favorably against other top-performing structured pruning approaches.

However, current methods lack a full understanding of different types of OOD data: there are benign OOD data that can be properly adapted to enhance the learning performance, while other malign OOD data would severely degenerate the classification result. To Harness OOD data, this paper proposes HOOD method that can leverage the content and style from each image instance to identify benign and malign OOD data. Particularly, we design a variational inference framework to causally disentangle content and style features by constructing a structural causal model. Subsequently, we augment the content and style through an intervention process to produce malign and benign OOD data, respectively. The benign OOD data contain novel styles but hold our interested contents, and they can be leveraged to help train a style-invariant model. In contrast, the malign OOD data inherit unknown contents but carry familiar styles, by detecting them can improve model robustness against deceiving anomalies.

    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "A standard hardware bottleneck when training deep neural networks is GPU memory. The bulk of memory is occupied by caching intermediate tensors for gradient computation in the backward pass. We propose a novel method to reduce this footprint - Dropping Intermediate Tensors (DropIT). DropIT drops min-k elements of the intermediate tensors and approximates gradients from the sparsified tensors in the backward pass. Theoretically, DropIT reduces noise on estimated gradients and therefore has a higher rate of convergence than vanilla-SGD. Experiments show that we can drop up to 90\\% of the intermediate tensor elements in fully-connected and convolutional layers while achieving higher testing accuracy for Visual Transformers and Convolutional Neural Networks on various tasks (e.g., classification, object detection, instance segmentation).

    "title": "A Unified Framework for Soft Threshold Pruning",
    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "Soft threshold pruning is among the cutting-edge pruning methods with state-of-the-art performance. However, previous methods either perform aimless searching on the threshold scheduler or simply set the threshold trainable, lacking theoretical explanation from a unified perspective. In this work, we reformulate soft threshold pruning as an implicit optimization problem solved using the Iterative Shrinkage-Thresholding Algorithm (ISTA), a classic method from the fields of sparse recovery and compressed sensing. Under this theoretical framework, all threshold tuning strategies proposed in previous studies of soft threshold pruning are concluded as different styles of tuning $L_1$-regularization term. We further derive an optimal threshold scheduler through an in-depth study of threshold scheduling based on our framework. This scheduler keeps $L_1$-regularization coefficient stable, implying a time-invariant objective function from the perspective of optimization. In principle, the derived pruning algorithm could sparsify any mathematical model trained via SGD. We conduct extensive experiments and verify its state-of-the-art performance on both Artificial Neural Networks (ResNet-50 and MobileNet-V1) and Spiking Neural Networks (SEW ResNet-18) on ImageNet datasets. On the basis of this framework, we derive a family of pruning methods, including sparsify-during-training, early pruning, and pruning at initialization.

    "title": "TaskPrompter: Spatial-Channel Multi-Task Prompting for Dense Scene Understanding",
    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "Learning effective representations simultaneously from multiple tasks in a unified network framework is a fundamental paradigm for multi-task dense visual scene understanding. This requires joint modeling (i) task-generic and (ii) task-specific representations, and (iii) cross-task representation interactions. Existing works typically model these three perspectives with separately designed structures, using shared network modules for task-generic learning, different modules for task-specific learning, and establishing connections among these components for cross-task interactions. It is barely explored in the literature to model these three perspectives in each network layer in an end-to-end manner, which can not only minimize the effort of carefully designing empirical structures for the three multi-task representation learning objectives, but also greatly improve the representation learning capability of the multi-task network since all the model capacity will be used to optimize the three objectives together. In this paper, we propose TaskPrompter, a novel spatial-channel multi-task prompting transformer framework to achieve this target. Specifically, we design a set of spatial-channel task prompts and learn their spatial- and channel interactions with the shared image tokens in each transformer layer with attention mechanism, as aggregating spatial and channel information is critical for dense prediction tasks. Each task prompt learns task-specific representation for one task, while all the prompts can jointly contribute to the learning of the shared image token representations, and the interactions between different task prompts model the cross-task relationship. To decode dense predictions for multiple tasks with the learned spatial-channel task prompts from transformer, we accordingly design a dense task prompt decoding mechanism, which queries the shared image tokens using task prompts to obtain spatial- and channel-wise task-specific representations. Extensive experiments on two challenging multi-task dense scene understanding benchmarks (i.e. NYUD-V2 and PASCAL-Context) show the superiority of the proposed framework and TaskPrompter establishes significant state-of-the-art performances on multi-task dense predictions.

    "title": "Learning Domain-Agnostic Representation for Disease Diagnosis",
    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "In clinical environments, image-based diagnosis is desired to achieve robustness on multi-center samples. Toward this goal, a natural way is to capture only clinically disease-related features. However, such disease-related features are often entangled with center-effect, disabling robust transferring to unseen centers/domains. To disentangle disease-related features, we first leverage structural causal modeling to explicitly model disease-related and center-effects that are provable to be disentangled from each other. Guided by this, we propose a novel Domain Agnostic Representation Model (DarMo) based on variational Auto-Encoder. To facilitate disentanglement, we design domain-agnostic and domain-aware encoders to respectively capture disease-related features and varied center-effects by incorporating a domain-aware batch normalization layer. Besides, we constrain the disease-related features to well predict the disease label as well as clinical attributes, by leveraging Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) into our decoder. The effectiveness and utility of our method are demonstrated by the superior performance over others on both public datasets and inhouse datasets",

    "title": "Logical Entity Representation in Knowledge-Graphs for Differentiable Rule Learning",
    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "Probabilistic logical rule learning has shown great strength in logical rule mining and knowledge graph completion. It learns logical rules to predict missing edges by reasoning on existing edges in the knowledge graph. However, previous efforts have largely been limited to only modeling chain-like Horn clauses such as R1(x; z) ^ R2(z; y) ) H(x; y). This formulation overlooks additional contextual information from neighboring sub-graphs of entity variables x, y and z. Intuitively, there is a large gap here, as local sub-graphs have been found to provide important information for knowledge graph completion. Inspired by these observations, we propose Logical Entity RePresentation (LERP) to encode contextual information of entities in the knowledge graph. A LERP is designed as a vector of probabilistic logical functions on the entity's neighboring sub-graph. It is an interpretable representation while allowing for differentiable optimization. We can then incorporate LERP into probabilistic logical rule learning to learn more expressive rules. Empirical results demonstrate that with LERP, our model outperforms other rule learning methods in knowledge graph completion and is comparable or even superior to state-of-the-art black-box methods. Moreover, we find that our model can discover a more expressive family of logical rules. LERP can also be further combined with embedding learning methods like TransE to make it more interpretable",

    "title": "BEVDistill: Cross-Modal BEV Distillation for Multi-View 3D Object Detection",
    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "3D object detection from multiple image views is a fundamental and challenging task for visual scene understanding. Owing to its low cost and high efficiency, multi-view 3D object detection has demonstrated promising application prospects. However, accurately detecting objects through perspective views is extremely difficult due to the lack of depth information. Current approaches tend to adopt heavy backbones for image encoders, making them inapplicable for real-world deployment. Different from the images, LiDAR points are superior in providing spatial cues, resulting in highly precise localization. In this paper, we explore the incorporation of LiDAR-based detectors for multi-view 3D object detection. Instead of directly training a depth prediction network, we unify the image and LiDAR features in the Bird-Eye-View (BEV) space and adaptively transfer knowledge across non-homogenous representations in a teacher-student paradigm. To this end, we propose BEVDistill, a cross-modal BEV knowledge distillation (KD) framework for multi-view 3D object detection. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms current KD approaches on a highly-competitive baseline, BEVFormer, without introducing any extra cost in the inference phase. Notably, our best model achieves 59.4 NDS on the nuScenes test leaderboard, achieving new state-of-the-arts in comparison with various image-based detectors.

In this paper, we try to marry these two systems for text classification via a structured language model. We propose a Symbolic-Neural model that can learn to explicitly predict class labels of text spans from a constituency tree without requiring any access to span-level gold labels. As the structured language model learns to predict constituency trees in a self-supervised manner, only raw texts and sentence-level labels are required as training data, which makes it essentially a general constituent-level self-interpretable classification model. Our experiments demonstrate that our approach could achieve good prediction accuracy in downstream tasks.

    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "This paper tackles the Few-shot Semantic Segmentation (FSS) task with focus on learning the feature extractor. Somehow the feature extractor has been overlooked by recent state-of-the-art methods, which directly use a deep model pretrained on ImageNet for feature extraction (without further fine-tuning). Under this background, we think the FSS feature extractor deserves exploration and observe the heterogeneity (i.e., the intra-class diversity in the raw images) as a critical challenge hindering the intra-class feature compactness. The heterogeneity has three levels from coarse to fine: 1) Sample-level: the inevitable distribution gap between the support and query images makes them heterogeneous from each other. 2) Region-level: the background in FSS actually contains multiple regions with different semantics. 3) Patch-level: some neighboring patches belonging to a same class may appear quite different from each other. Motivated by these observations, we propose a feature extractor with Multi-level Heterogeneity Suppressing (MuHS). MuHS leverages the attention mechanism in transformer backbone to effectively suppress all these three-level heterogeneity. Concretely, MuHS reinforces the attention / interaction between different samples (query and support), different regions and neighboring patches by constructing cross-sample attention, cross-region interaction and a novel masked image segmentation (inspired by the recent masked image modeling), respectively. We empirically show that 1) MuHS brings consistent improvement for various FSS heads and 2) using a simple linear classification head, MuHS sets new states of the art on multiple FSS datasets, validating the importance of FSS feature learning",

    "title": "Achieve the Minimum Width of Neural Networks for Universal Approximation",

    "abstract": "The universal approximation property (UAP) of neural networks is fundamental for deep learning, and it is well known that wide neural networks are universal approximators of continuous functions within both the $L^p$ norm and the continuous/uniform norm. However, the exact minimum width, $w_{\\min}$, for the UAP has not been studied thoroughly. Recently, using a decoder-memorizer-encoder scheme, \\citet{Park2021Minimum} found that $w_{\\min} = \\max(d_x+1,d_y)$ for both the $L^p$-UAP of ReLU networks and the $C$-UAP of ReLU+STEP networks, where $d_x,d_y$ are the input and output dimensions, respectively. In this paper, we consider neural networks with an arbitrary set of activation functions. We prove that both $C$-UAP and $L^p$-UAP for functions on compact domains share a universal lower bound of the minimal width; that is, $w^*_{\\min} = \\max(d_x,d_y)$. In particular, the critical width, $w^*_{\\min}$, for $L^p$-UAP can be achieved by leaky-ReLU networks, provided that the input or output dimension is larger than one. Our construction is based on the approximation power of neural ordinary differential equations and the ability to approximate flow maps by neural networks. The nonmonotone or discontinuous activation functions case and the one-dimensional case are also discussed",

    "abstract": "Oriented object detection emerges in many applications from aerial images to autonomous driving, while many existing detection benchmarks are annotated with horizontal bounding box only which is also less costive than fine-grained rotated box, leading to a gap between the readily available training corpus and the rising demand for oriented object detection. This paper proposes a simple yet effective oriented object detection approach called H2RBox merely using horizontal box annotation for weakly-supervised training, which closes the above gap and shows competitive performance even against those trained with rotated boxes. The cores of our method are weakly- and self-supervised learning, which predicts the angle of the object by learning the consistency of two different views. To our best knowledge, H2RBox is the first horizontal box annotation-based oriented object detector. Compared to an alternative i.e. horizontal box-supervised instance segmentation with our post adaption to oriented object detection, our approach is not susceptible to the prediction quality of mask and can perform more robustly in complex scenes containing a large number of dense objects and outliers. Experimental results show that H2RBox has significant performance and speed advantages over horizontal box-supervised instance segmentation methods, as well as lower memory requirements. While compared to rotated box-supervised oriented object detectors, our method shows very close performance and speed.

    "abstract": "In the area of few-shot anomaly detection (FSAD), efficient visual feature plays an essential role in the memory bank $\\mathcal{M}$-based methods. However, these methods do not account for the relationship between the visual feature and its rotated visual feature, drastically limiting the anomaly detection performance. To push the limits, we reveal that rotation-invariant feature property has a significant impact on industrial-based FSAD. Specifically, we utilize graph representation in FSAD and provide a novel visual isometric invariant feature (VIIF) as an anomaly measurement feature. As a result, VIIF can robustly improve the anomaly discriminating ability and can further reduce the size of redundant features stored in $\\mathcal{M}$ by a large amount. Besides, we provide a novel model GraphCore via VIIFs that can fast implement unsupervised FSAD training and improve the performance of anomaly detection. A comprehensive evaluation is provided for comparing GraphCore and other SOTA anomaly detection models under our proposed few-shot anomaly detection setting, which shows GraphCore can increase average AUC by 5.8%, 4.1%, 3.4%, and 1.6% on MVTec AD and by 25.5%, 22.0%, 16.9%, and 14.1% on MPDD for 1, 2, 4, and 8-shot cases, respectively",

    "title": "Cross Domain Vulnerability Detection using Graph Contrastive Learning",
    "volume": "tiny",
    "abstract": "To overcome the difficulty of finding good-quality labeled data in domains such as vulnerability detection, Self--Supervised Learning (SSL) methods such as Contrastive Learning (CL) algorithms were developed. We evaluate the performance of one such state-of-the-art CL method, GraphCL, that trains on our graph dataset generated from code repositories of six widely used C/C++ applications. We also propose a custom graph type having a new structure that combines both code-level and binary-level CPG graphs. This is because, even though existing graph types such as AST, CFG and CPG are effective in detecting vulnerabilities in the source code, it is ineffective in detecting the ones that only occur in the binary-level. Hence, to detect those vulnerabilities, we propose a new graph type, Cross Domain Control Property Graph (CDCPG). We perform extensive experiments, using different augmentation techniques and loss functions to show that our custom graph type, CDCPG, performs better than other graph types in many scenarios",

With globalization, young Africans are becoming increasingly disconnected from their roots, making it essential to collect and preserve this knowledge. However, the lack of accessible data on African culture presents a significant challenge. This research aims to address this problem by exploring new ways to collect and preserve African cultural data. Specifically, we have developed a device to perform continuous recording of cultural radio programs in local languages, which has enabled us to collect over 1500 hours of audio data. We are also exploring the use of a whisper model, which has proven to be effective in outperforming human transcription and being multilingual.

However, CNNs performance could be constrained by the limited receptive field of regular convolution. To mitigate this problem, a new modification for CNNs was proposed: Fast Fourier Convolution (FFC). Here, a global receptive field is achieved by using Fourier Transform and convolving spectral representation. The global perception field can help CNNs to better capture dependencies in image regions that are far apart. In this work, we design multiple approaches for incorporating FFC into self-supervised neural networks for image denoising. We evaluate these approaches on three benchmark datasets and compare them with supervised and self-supervised methods.

    "abstract": "Career planning involves devising a sequence of steps that build up an ideal career path for a person. However, career planning has become more complex in recent years, demanding the need for better models and systems for recommending Career Paths. With that in mind, we explored new variables and techniques that could help in predicting better career paths. We built a Long-Short Term Memory Network with Self Attention Layers called LSTM-ATT, that predicts a person's possible career path using Linkedin Career History and new variables such as salary estimations and social networks. We measured the model's performance in terms of Mean Percentile Rank and Precision at 50 and 100. We found that LSTM and self-attention layers were able to show good predictive performance for multi-class classification even with over 6000 classes for companies and skills, effectively beating a multi-channel CNN for all metrics. However, by checking the versions of either model with added features, they did not yield any major increase in predictive accuracy against the models without it. This leads us to conclude that the added variables did not help in predicting better career paths",

    "abstract": "Transfer learning for extremely low-resource languages is a challenging task as there is no large-scale monolingual corpora for pre-training or sufficient annotated data for fine-tuning. We follow the work of (Xia et al., 2021) which suggests using meta learning for transfer learning from a single source language to an extremely low resource one. We propose an enhanced approach which uses multiple source languages chosen in a data-driven manner. In addition, we introduce a sample selection strategy for utilizing the languages in training by using a multi armed bandit algorithm. Using both of these improvements we managed to achieve state-of-the-art results on the NER task for the extremely low resource languages even with the same amount of data, making the representations better generalized. Also, due to the method's ability to use multiple languages it allows the framework to use much larger amounts of data, while still having superior results over the former MetaXL method even with the same amounts of data",

To this end, we construct a WordNet-based dataset containing a subset for abstract concepts and a subset for concrete concepts. We select six pre-trained LLMs and conduct a classic NLP task, hypernym discovery, as evidence of LLMs' comprehension ability in understanding concepts.

Comprehending referring expressions (ReC) like \"the brown cookie near the cup\" requires to understand both self-referential expressions, \"brown cookie\", and relational referential expressions, \"near the cup\". Large pretrained Vision-Language models like CLIP excel at handling self-referential expressions, while struggle with the latter. In this work, we reframe ReC as a language reasoning task and explore whether it can be addressed using large pretrained language models (LLMs), including GPT-3.5 and GPT-4. Given the textual attribute (object category, color, center location, size), GPT-3.5 performs unstably on understanding spatial relationships even with heavy prompt engineering, while GPT-4 shows strong and stable zero-shot relation reasoning. Evaluation on RefCOCO/g datasets and scenarios of interactive robot grasping shows that LLMs can do ReC with decent performance. It suggests a vast potential of using LLMs to enhance the reasoning in vision tasks. The code can be accessed at https://github.com/xiuchao/LLM4ReC",

We consider a simple experimental setting of attacking models trained for binary classification on pairwise CIFAR10 datasets - altogether a total of 45 datasets. We study ensembles of {\\bf bcebp}: binary cross-entropy loss with relu activations trained with back-propagation, {\\bf bceban}: binary cross-entropy loss with sign activations trained with back-propagation with the straight through estimator gradient, {\\bf 01scd}: 01-loss with sign activations trained with gradient-free stochastic coordinate descent, and {\\bf bcescd}: binary cross-entropy loss with relu activation trained with gradient-free stochastic coordinate descent (to isolate the effect of 01 loss from gradient-free training). We train each model in an ensemble with a different random number generator seed. Our four models have similar mean test accuracies in the mid to high 80s on pairwise CIFAR10 datasets but under powerful PGD white-box attacks they each drop to near 0\\% except for our 01 loss network ensemble that has 31\\% accuracy. Even training with the gradient-free stochastic coordinate descent can be attacked thus suggesting that the defense lies in 01 loss. In a black-box transfer attack we find adversaries produced from the bcebp model fully transfer to bceban but much less to 01scd - we see the same transferability pattern from bceban to bcebp and 01scd. We also find that adversaries from 01scd barely transfer to bcebp and bceban. While our results are far from those of multi-class and convolutional networks, they suggest that 01 loss models are hard to attack naturally without any adversarial training.

    "volume": "tiny",
    "abstract": "The use of relative representations for latent embeddings has shown potential in enabling latent space communication and zero-shot model stitching across a wide range of applications. Nevertheless, relative representations rely on a certain amount of parallel anchors to be given as input, which can be impractical to obtain in certain scenarios. To overcome this limitation, we propose an optimization-based method to discover new parallel anchors from a limited known set (seed). Our approach can be used to find semantic correspondence between different domains, align their relative spaces, and achieve competitive results in several tasks",

    "title": "A Brief History of the Speculative Measures for Autonomy",
    "volume": "tiny",
    "abstract": "This paper presents a novel summary of the history of the evolution of the measures for autonomy (i.e. self-legislating systems), from Creation myths to the study of technological autonomy, progressing through five interrelated phases. First, the original legislator of the laws of nature is considered as the singular measure for autonomous existence. Second, a set of hierarchical governing systems are conceived as a sort of supplement to the limitations of the original monopolistic autonomy. Third, this hierarchy of governors is inverted by transcendental philosophy, putting emphasis on the immediate conscious \"self\" - the auto - in self-legislation. The fourth stage emerges in existential philosophy, which notices the seemingly inescapable paradoxes of this introverted autonomy, as all justice and justification becomes circularly self-justified. The fifth and most contemporary measure of autonomy universalizes this existential insight and measures each being's autonomy simply in proportion to its own alienated independence. The paper concludes with an analysis on the potential limits of this universalized autonomy and suggests a route for future research which may ultimately separate the measure of autonomy from the measure of responsibility for justice",

Building from an existing human-generated dataset, we show that machine-verified norms capture aspects of conceptual structure beyond what is expressed in human norms alone, and better explain human judgments of semantic similarity amongst items that are distally related. The results suggest that LLMs can greatly enhance traditional methods of semantic feature norm verification, with implications for our understanding of conceptual representation in humans and machines",

Given the incomplete information in a complex dataset, a learning model captures non-linear patterns between data points with volatility in the loss surface and exploitable areas of low-confidence knowledge. It is the responsibility of activation functions to capture the non-linearity in data and, thus, has inspired disjointed research efforts to create robust activation functions. This work unifies the properties of activation functions that contribute to robust generalization with the generalized gamma distribution function. We show that combining the disjointed characteristics presented in the literature provides more effective robustness than the individual characteristics alone",

Recent work on single positive multi-label (SPML) learning has shown that it is possible to train effective multi-label classifiers using only one positive label per image. The standard benchmarks for SPML are derived from traditional multi-label classification datasets by retaining one positive label for each training example (chosen uniformly at random) and discarding all other labels. However, in realistic annotation settings it is not likely that positive labels are chosen uniformly at random. In this work, we explore the effect of label bias in SPML",

It involved a cross-sectional study using an online survey consisting of close-ended questions. The survey targeted medical students at all medical levels and doctors in their postgraduate training. total of 481 medical students and doctors responded. When assessing AI knowledge sources (86.5%) got their information from the media as compared to (13.5%) from medical school curriculum. However, students who learned the basics of AI while being in medical school were more knowledge about AI than their peers who did not and were more interested in the applications of AI in healthcare. The advancements in AI affected the choice of specialty of around a quarter of the students (26.8%). Finally, less than a quarter of students (22.1%) want to be assessed by AI, even though about half (57.7%) reported that assessment by AI is more objective. In conclusion, Although most physicians and medical students do not sufficiently understand AI and its significance in the medical field, they have favorable views regarding using AI in the medical field and a willing to learn the fundamentals. Nigerians medical authorities and international organizations should suggest including artificial intelligence in the medical field, particularly when training residents and fellowship physicians",

Our results suggest that LLMs underperform in comparison with state-of-the-art and human performance.

    "abstract": "Visibility of an area affects all forms of transportation such as sea, surface and aviation which can further affect the economy of that area. Thus it is very important to accurately estimate the visibility of an area for the upcoming days based on different parameters of the past meteorological data, so that we can take precautions in case of poor visibility. Several machine learning techniques have been already applied on different kinds of data sets to estimate the visibility. However, most of these methods could not perform reasonably well and none of them were applied on the meteorological data of the Indo-Gangetic plane in India, which witnesses widespread fog primarily during winter that badly impacts visibility and therefore transportation. In this spirit, a Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGboost) based regression framework is developed here to estimate the visibility of the Indo-Gangetic plane. The method identifies significant parameters of the data following different standard feature engineering schemes and subsequently implement the XGboost regression model. The experimental results show that the proposed framework outperforms the state of the arts in terms of mean absolute error (MAE) and root mean squared error (RMSE). In future, the aim is to explore the performance of this framework to estimate the visibility of other crucial areas across globe",

    "volume": "tiny",
    "abstract": "Drug discovery is a complex process that requires extensive research and development. One important aspect of drug discovery is the prediction of drug properties, such as solubility. In recent years, sequence-based embedding methods, such as SMILES strings, have gained popularity in the drug discovery community due to their ability to encode chemical structures. SMILES strings are text-based representations of chemical structures that can be easily processed by machine learning models. This research paper presents a study on predicting (i) the solubility ALOGPS (Ghose-Crippen-Viswanadhan octanol-water partition coefficient) and (ii) drug subcategories using traditional molecular fingerprints and sequence-based embedding methods (from the bioinformatics domain) of SMILES strings. The study investigates five types of embeddings: Morgan fingerprint, MACCS fingerprint, $k$-mers, and minimizer-based spectrum. Additionally, a weighted version of $k$-mers that employs inverse document frequency is used to assign weights to each $k$-mer within the spectrum. For the classification task (\\ie, drug subcategory prediction), we use the same embedding methods as input to several classifiers and report classification goodness using several evaluation metrics. For the regression task (\\ie, solubility ALOGPS prediction), we use several popular models \\eg, linear regression, and evaluate the performance using multiple evaluation metrics such as RMSE MAE, MSE, etc. The classification results indicate that the weighted $k$-mers method outperforms the baselines for predictive performance. The regression results indicate that the MACCS fingerprint with random forest regression model outperforms all other embedding methods and regression models. Overall, this study provides insights into the effectiveness of different embeddings, regression models, and classification models for solubility and drug subcategory prediction, which can be helpful for future tasks such as drug discovery",

In this work, we propose mapping the information in medical records to paths extracted from the SNOMED CT knowledge graph. To achieve this, we have leveraged language models to extract feature embeddings from EHR and compare them against the paths found in SNOMED CT. Our motivation is that this method can significantly assist the diagnosis process, ultimately leading to better healthcare outcomes. We have used several strategies to score the paths and evaluated them with experts in this field who have provided encouraging feedback on the outcomes of this approach",

    "abstract": "Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs) have been used extensively to model physical systems because they represent a continuous-time function that can make predictions over the entire time domain. However, most of the time, the parameters of these physical systems are subject to strict laws/constraints. But there is no guarantee that the Neural ODE model satisfies these constraints. Therefore, we propose a two-stage training for Neural ODE. The first stage aims at finding feasible parameters by minimizing a loss function defined by the constraints violation. The second stage aims at improving the feasible solution by minimizing the distance between the predicted and ground-truth values. By training the Neural ODE in two stages, we ensure that the governing laws of the system are satisfied and the model fits the data",

    "volume": "tiny",
    "abstract": "Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) are capable of encoding and processing temporal information in a biologically plausible way. However, most existing SNN-based methods for image tasks do not fully exploit this feature. Moreover, they often overlook the role of adaptive threshold in spiking neurons, which can enhance their dynamic behavior and learning ability. To address these issues, we propose a novel method for image decoding based on temporal attention (TAID) and an adaptive Leaky-Integrate-and-Fire (ALIF) neuron model. Our method leverages the temporal information of SNN outputs to generate high-quality images that surpass the state-of-the-art (SOTA) in terms of Inception score, Fréchet Inception Distance, and Fréchet Autoencoder Distance. Furthermore, our ALIF neuron model achieves remarkable classification accuracy on MNIST (99.78%) and CIFAR-10 (93.89%) datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness of learning adaptive thresholds for spiking neurons",

Nevertheless, the current OCR methods, no matter regression based or classification based, are difficult to recognize such a huge amount of characters. In this work, we simply treat characters like human faces and adopt the MobileFaceNetV3 to recognize over 74,000 Chinese characters included in Unicode.

Well-calibrated distributions of possible poses can make these ambiguities explicit and preserve the resulting uncertainty for downstream tasks, thus providing the necessary trustworthiness in safety-critical domains. This study shows that multi-hypothesis pose estimation methods produce miscalibrated distributions. We identify that miscalibration can be attributed to the optimization of mean per joint position error (MPJPE). In a series of simulations, we show that minimizing minMPJPE, the MPJPE of the best hypothesis, converges to the correct mean prediction. However, it fails to correctly capture the uncertainty, hence resulting in a miscalibrated distribution",

    "title": "MULTI-AGENT REINFORCEMENT LEARNING FOR COALITIONAL BARGAINING GAMES",
    "volume": "tiny",
    "abstract": "In recent years, there has been growing attention to the application of MARL to coalition formation problems, in particular, on coalitional bargaining games as a means of negotiation. However, the lack of theoretical principles for using MARL in coalitional bargaining games remain less explored. This paper aims to address this gap by providing an examination of the theoretical link between coalition formation, coalitional bargaining games, and MARL through the link of stochastic games. Through this analysis, the paper seeks to shed light on the underlying principles that support the use of MARL in coalitional bargaining and to explore the contributions of this approach and its limitations in comparison to traditional game theoretical methods",

    "title": "Astroformer: More Data might not be all you need for Classification",
    "volume": "tiny",
    "abstract": "Recent advancements in areas such as natural language processing and computer vision rely on intricate and massive models that have been trained using vast amounts of unlabelled or partly labeled data and training or deploying these state-of-the-art methods to resource constraint environments has been a challenge. Galaxy morphologies are crucial to understanding the processes by which galaxies form and evolve. Efficient methods to classify galaxy morphologies are required to extract physical information from modern-day astronomy surveys. In this paper, we introduce Astroformer, a method to learn from less amount of data. We propose using a hybrid transformer-convolutional architecture drawing much inspiration from the success of CoAtNet and MaxViT. Concretely, we use the transformer-convolutional hybrid with a new stack design for the network, a different way of creating a relative self-attention layer, and pair it with a careful selection of data augmentation and regularization techniques. Our approach sets a new state-of-the-art on predicting galaxy morphologies from images on the Galaxy10 DECals dataset, a science objective, which consists of 17736 labeled images achieving $94.86\\%$ top-$1$ accuracy, beating the current state-of-the-art for this task by $4.62\\%$. Furthermore, this approach also sets a new state-of-the-art on CIFAR-100 and Tiny ImageNet. We also find that models and training methods used for larger datasets would often not work very well in the low-data regime",

    "abstract": "Clinical scores are highly interpretable and widely used in clinical risk stratification. AutoScore was previously developed as a clinical score generator, integrating the interpretability of clinical scores and the discriminability of machine learning. Although a basic framework has been established, AutoScore leaves room for enhancement: variable ranking via the random forest and manual model selection. In this work, we improved them with additional variable ranking methods and an automatic model selection. We demonstrated that these updates generate clinical scores with fewer variables and higher accuracy. The code is available at https://github.com/Han-Yuan-Med/comparison",

In this paper, using the Nightingale Open Science dataset of digital pathology (breast biopsy) images, we leverage the capabilities of pre-trained computer vision models for the breast cancer stage prediction task. While individual models achieve decent performances and demonstrate usefulness to the task at hand, we find out that the predictions of an ensemble model are more efficient",
