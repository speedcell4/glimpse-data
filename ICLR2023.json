    "title": "Encoding Recurrence into Transformers",
    "abstract": "This paper novelly breaks down with ignorable loss an RNN layer into a sequence of simple RNNs, each of which can be further rewritten into a lightweight positional encoding matrix of a self-attention, named the Recurrence Encoding Matrix (REM). Thus, recurrent dynamics introduced by the RNN layer can be encapsulated into the positional encodings of a multihead self-attention, and this makes it possible to seamlessly incorporate these recurrent dynamics into a Transformer, leading to a new module, Self-Attention with Recurrence (RSA). The proposed module can leverage the recurrent inductive bias of REMs to achieve a better sample efficiency than its corresponding baseline Transformer, while the self-attention is used to model the remaining non-recurrent signals. The relative proportions of these two components are controlled by a data-driven gated mechanism, and the effectiveness of RSA modules are demonstrated by four sequential learning tasks",

    "title": "Scaling Up Probabilistic Circuits by Latent Variable Distillation",
    "abstract": "Probabilistic Circuits (PCs) are a unified framework for tractable probabilistic models that support efficient computation of various probabilistic queries (e.g., marginal probabilities). One key challenge is to scale PCs to model large and high-dimensional real-world datasets: we observe that as the number of parameters in PCs increases, their performance immediately plateaus. This phenomenon suggests that the existing optimizers fail to exploit the full expressive power of large PCs. We propose to overcome such bottleneck by latent variable distillation: we leverage the less tractable but more expressive deep generative models to provide extra supervision over the latent variables of PCs. Specifically, we extract information from Transformer-based generative models to assign values to latent variables of PCs, providing guidance to PC optimizers. Experiments on both image and language modeling benchmarks (e.g., ImageNet and WikiText-2) show that latent variable distillation substantially boosts the performance of large PCs compared to their counterparts without latent variable distillation. In particular, on the image modeling benchmarks, PCs achieve competitive performance against some of the widely-used deep generative models, including variational autoencoders and flow-based models, opening up new avenues for tractable generative modeling.

    "abstract": "The success of deep learning is due in large part to our ability to solve certain massive non-convex optimization problems with relative ease. Though non-convex optimization is NP-hard, simple algorithms -- often variants of stochastic gradient descent -- exhibit surprising effectiveness in fitting large neural networks in practice. We argue that neural network loss landscapes often contain (nearly) a single basin after accounting for all possible permutation symmetries of hidden units a la Entezari et al. 2021. We introduce three algorithms to permute the units of one model to bring them into alignment with a reference model in order to merge the two models in weight space. This transformation produces a functionally equivalent set of weights that lie in an approximately convex basin near the reference model. Experimentally, we demonstrate the single basin phenomenon across a variety of model architectures and datasets, including the first (to our knowledge) demonstration of zero-barrier linear mode connectivity between independently trained ResNet models on CIFAR-10. Additionally, we identify intriguing phenomena relating model width and training time to mode connectivity. Finally, we discuss shortcomings of the linear mode connectivity hypothesis, including a counterexample to the single basin theory",

    "title": "The Role of Coverage in Online Reinforcement Learning",
    "abstract": "Coverage conditions---which assert that the data logging distribution adequately covers the state space---play a fundamental role in determining the sample complexity of offline reinforcement learning. While such conditions might seem irrelevant to online reinforcement learning at first glance, we establish a new connection by showing---somewhat surprisingly---that the mere existence of a data distribution with good coverage can enable sample-efficient online RL. Concretely, we show that coverability---that is, existence of a data distribution that satisfies a ubiquitous coverage condition called concentrability---can be viewed as a structural property of the underlying MDP, and can be exploited by standard algorithms for sample-efficient exploration, even when the agent does not know said distribution. We complement this result by proving that several weaker notions of coverage, despite being sufficient for offline RL, are insufficient for online RL. We also show that existing complexity measures for online RL, including Bellman rank and Bellman-Eluder dimension, fail to optimally capture coverability, and propose a new complexity measure, the self-normalized coefficient, to provide a unification",

    "title": "Is the Performance of My Deep Network Too Good to Be True? A Direct Approach to Estimating the Bayes Error in Binary Classification",
    "abstract": "There is a fundamental limitation in the prediction performance that a machine learning model can achieve due to the inevitable uncertainty of the prediction target. In classification problems, this can be characterized by the Bayes error, which is the best achievable error with any classifier. The Bayes error can be used as a criterion to evaluate classifiers with state-of-the-art performance and can be used to detect test set overfitting. We propose a simple and direct Bayes error estimator, where we just take the mean of the labels that show \\emph{uncertainty} of the class assignments. Our flexible approach enables us to perform Bayes error estimation even for weakly supervised data. In contrast to others, our method is model-free and even instance-free. Moreover, it has no hyperparameters and gives a more accurate estimate of the Bayes error than several baselines empirically. Experiments using our method suggest that recently proposed deep networks such as the Vision Transformer may have reached, or is about to reach, the Bayes error for benchmark datasets. Finally, we discuss how we can study the inherent difficulty of the acceptance/rejection decision for scientific articles, by estimating the Bayes error of the ICLR papers from 2017 to 2023",

    "abstract": "The potential of offline reinforcement learning (RL) is that high-capacity models trained on large, heterogeneous datasets can lead to agents that generalize broadly, analogously to similar advances in vision and NLP. However, recent works argue that offline RL methods encounter unique challenges to scaling up model capacity. Drawing on the learnings from these works, we re-examine previous design choices and find that with appropriate choices: ResNets, cross-entropy based distributional backups, and feature normalization, offline Q-learning algorithms exhibit strong performance that scales with model capacity. Using multi-task Atari as a testbed for scaling and generalization, we train a single policy on 40 games with near-human performance using up-to 80 million parameter networks, finding that model performance scales favorably with capacity. In contrast to prior work, we extrapolate beyond dataset performance even when trained entirely on a large (400M transitions) but highly suboptimal dataset (51% human-level performance). Compared to return-conditioned supervised approaches, offline Q-learning scales similarly with model capacity and has better performance, especially when the dataset is suboptimal. Finally, we show that offline Q-learning with a diverse dataset is sufficient to learn powerful representations that facilitate rapid transfer to novel games and fast online learning on new variations of a training game, improving over existing state-of-the-art representation learning approaches",

    "abstract": "Neural sequence models, especially transformers, exhibit a remarkable capacity for in-context learning. They can construct new predictors from sequences of labeled examples \n(\nx\n,\nf\n(\nx\n)\n)\n presented in the input without further parameter updates. We investigate the hypothesis that transformer-based in-context learners implement standard learning algorithms implicitly, by encoding context-specific parametric models in their hidden representations, and updating these implicit models as new examples appear in the context. Using linear regression as a model problem, we offer three sources of evidence for this hypothesis. First, we prove by construction that transformers can implement learning algorithms for linear models based on gradient descent and closed-form computation of regression parameters. Second, we show that trained in-context learners closely match the predictors computed by gradient descent, ridge regression, and exact least-squares regression, transitioning between different predictors as transformer depth and dataset noise vary. Third, we present preliminary evidence that in-context learners share algorithmic features with these predictors: learners' late layers encode weight vectors and moment matrices.  These results suggest that in-context learning is understandable in algorithmic terms, and that (at least in the linear case) learners may work by rediscovering standard estimation algorithms",

    "title": "When and Why Vision-Language Models Behave like Bags-Of-Words, and What to Do About It?",
    "abstract": "Despite the success of large vision and language models (VLMs) in many downstream applications, it is unclear how well they encode the compositional relationships between objects and attributes. Here, we create the Attribution, Relation, and Order (ARO) benchmark to systematically evaluate the ability of VLMs to understand different types of relationships, attributes, and order information. ARO consists of \\emph{Visual Genome Attribution}, to test the understanding of objects' properties; \\emph{Visual Genome Relation}, to test for relational understanding; and \\emph{COCO-Order \\& Flickr30k-Order}, to test for order sensitivity in VLMs. ARO is orders of magnitude larger than previous benchmarks of compositionality, with more than 50,000 test cases. We present the settings where  state-of-the-art VLMs behave like bags-of-words---i.e. when they have poor relational understanding, can blunder when linking objects to their attributes, and demonstrate a severe lack of order sensitivity. VLMs are predominantly trained and evaluated on large scale datasets with rich compositional structure in the images and captions. Yet, training on these datasets has not been enough to address the lack of compositional understanding, and evaluating on these datasets has failed to surface this deficiency. To understand why these limitations emerge and are not represented in the standard tests, we zoom into the evaluation and training procedures. We demonstrate that it is possible to perform well on image-text retrieval over existing datasets without using the composition and order information. This further motivates the value of using ARO to benchmark VLMs. Given that contrastive pretraining optimizes for retrieval on large datasets with similar shortcuts, we hypothesize that this can explain why the models do not need to learn to represent compositional information. This finding suggests a natural solution: composition-aware hard negative mining. We show that a simple-to-implement modification of contrastive learning significantly improves the performance on tasks requiring understanding of order and compositionality",

    "title": "Confidence-Conditioned Value Functions for Offline Reinforcement Learning",
    "abstract": "Offline reinforcement learning (RL) promises the ability to learn effective policies solely using existing, static datasets, without any costly online interaction. To do so, offline RL methods must handle distributional shift between the dataset and the learned policy. The most common approach is to learn conservative, or lower-bound, value functions, which underestimate the return of OOD actions. However, such methods exhibit one notable drawback: policies optimized on such value functions can only behave according to a fixed, possibly suboptimal, degree of conservatism. However, this can be alleviated if we instead are able to learn policies for varying degrees of conservatism at training time and devise a method to dynamically choose one of them during evaluation. To do so, in this work, we propose learning value functions that additionally condition on the degree of conservatism, which we dub confidence-conditioned value functions. We derive a new form of a Bellman backup that simultaneously learns Q-values for any degree of confidence with high probability. By conditioning on confidence, our value functions enable adaptive strategies during online evaluation by controlling for confidence level using the history of observations thus far. This approach can be implemented in practice by conditioning the Q-function from existing conservative algorithms on the confidence. We theoretically show that our learned value functions produce conservative estimates of the true value at any desired confidence. Finally, we empirically show that our algorithm outperforms existing conservative offline RL algorithms on multiple discrete control domains",

    "abstract": "While recent camera-only 3D detection methods leverage multiple timesteps, the limited history they use significantly hampers the extent to which temporal fusion can improve object perception. Observing that existing works' fusion of multi-frame images are instances of temporal stereo matching, we find that performance is hindered by the interplay between 1) the low granularity of matching resolution and 2) the sub-optimal multi-view setup produced by limited history usage. Our theoretical and empirical analysis demonstrates that the optimal temporal difference between views varies significantly for different pixels and depths, making it necessary to fuse many timesteps over long-term history. Building on our investigation, we propose to generate a cost volume from a long history of image observations, compensating for the coarse but efficient matching resolution with a more optimal multi-view matching setup. Further, we augment the per-frame monocular depth predictions used for long-term, coarse matching with short-term, fine-grained matching and find that long and short term temporal fusion are highly complementary. While maintaining high efficiency, our framework sets new state-of-the-art on nuScenes, achieving first place on the test set and outperforming previous best art by 5.2% mAP and 3.7% NDS on the validation set.

    "title": "Dichotomy of Control: Separating What You Can Control from What You Cannot",
    "abstract": "Future- or return-conditioned supervised learning is an emerging paradigm for offline reinforcement learning (RL), in which the future outcome (i.e., return) associated with a sequence of actions in an offline dataset is used as input to a policy trained to imitate those same actions. While return-conditioning is at the heart of popular algorithms such as decision transformer (DT), these methods tend to perform poorly in highly stochastic environments, where an occasional high return associated with a sequence of actions may be due more to the randomness of the environment than to the actions themselves. Such situations can lead to a learned policy that is inconsistent with its conditioning inputs; i.e., using the policy – while conditioned on a specific desired return – to act in the environment can lead to a distribution of real returns that is wildly different than desired. In this work, we propose the dichotomy of control (DoC), a future-conditioned supervised learning framework that separates mechanisms within a policy’s control (actions) from those outside of a policy’s control (environment stochasticity). We achieve this by conditioning the policy on a latent variable representation of the future and designing a mutual information constraint that removes any future information from the latent variable that is only due to randomness of the environment. Theoretically, we show that DoC yields policies that are consistent with their conditioning inputs, ensuring that conditioning a learned policy on a desired high-return future outcome will correctly induce high-return behavior. Empirically, we show that DoC is able to achieve significantly better performance than DT on environments with highly stochastic rewards (e.g., Bandit) and transitions (e.g., FrozenLake)",

In this work, we circumvent these limitations by using a pretrained 2D text-to-image diffusion model to perform text-to-3D synthesis. We introduce a loss based on probability density distillation that enables the use of a 2D diffusion model as a prior for optimization of a parametric image generator. Using this loss in a DeepDream-like procedure, we optimize a randomly-initialized 3D model (a Neural Radiance Field, or NeRF) via gradient descent such that its 2D renderings from random angles achieve a low loss. The resulting 3D model of the given text can be viewed from any angle, relit by arbitrary illumination, or composited into any 3D environment.

    "abstract": "Dense prediction tasks are a fundamental class of problems in computer vision. As supervised methods suffer from high pixel-wise labeling cost, a few-shot learning solution that can learn any dense task from a few labeled images is desired. Yet, current few-shot learning methods target a restricted set of tasks such as semantic segmentation, presumably due to challenges in designing a general and unified model that is able to flexibly and efficiently adapt to arbitrary tasks of unseen semantics. We propose Visual Token Matching (VTM), a universal few-shot learner for arbitrary dense prediction tasks. It employs non-parametric matching on patch-level embedded tokens of images and labels that encapsulates all tasks. Also, VTM flexibly adapts to any task with a tiny amount of task-specific parameters that modulate the matching algorithm. We implement VTM as a powerful hierarchical encoder-decoder architecture involving ViT backbones where token matching is performed at multiple feature hierarchies. We experiment VTM on a challenging variant of Taskonomy dataset and observe that it robustly few-shot learns various unseen dense prediction tasks. Surprisingly, it is competitive with fully supervised baselines using only 10 labeled examples of novel tasks (\n0.004\n%\n of full supervision) and sometimes outperforms using \n0.1\n%\n of full supervision.

In this paper, we explore the use of LLMs to generate both reasoning traces and task-specific actions in an interleaved manner, allowing for greater synergy between the two: reasoning traces help the model induce, track, and update action plans as well as handle exceptions, while actions allow it to interface with external sources, such as knowledge bases or environments, to gather additional information. We apply our approach, named ReAct, to a diverse set of language and decision making tasks and demonstrate its effectiveness over state-of-the-art baselines, as well as improved human interpretability and trustworthiness over methods without reasoning or acting components. Concretely, on question answering (HotpotQA) and fact verification (Fever), ReAct overcomes issues of hallucination and error propagation prevalent in chain-of-thought reasoning by interacting with a simple Wikipedia API, and generates human-like task-solving trajectories that are more interpretable than baselines without reasoning traces. On two interactive decision making benchmarks (ALFWorld and WebShop), ReAct outperforms imitation and reinforcement learning methods by an absolute success rate of 34% and 10% respectively, while being prompted with only one or two in-context examples",

    "abstract": "Equivariance guarantees that a model's predictions capture key symmetries in data. When an image is translated or rotated, an equivariant model's representation of that image will translate or rotate accordingly. The success of convolutional neural networks has historically been tied to translation equivariance directly encoded in their architecture. The rising success of vision transformers, which have no explicit architectural bias towards equivariance, challenges this narrative and suggests that augmentations and training data might also play a significant role in their performance. In order to better understand the role of equivariance in recent vision models, we apply the Lie derivative, a method for measuring equivariance with strong mathematical foundations and minimal hyperparameters. Using the Lie derivative, we study the equivariance properties of hundreds of pretrained models, spanning CNNs, transformers, and Mixer architectures. The scale of our analysis allows us to separate the impact of architecture from other factors like model size or training method. Surprisingly, we find that many violations of equivariance can be linked to spatial aliasing in ubiquitous network layers, such as pointwise non-linearities, and that as models get larger and more accurate they tend to display more equivariance, regardless of architecture. For example, transformers can be more equivariant than convolutional neural networks after training",

    "title": "Agree to Disagree: Diversity through Disagreement for Better Transferability",
    "abstract": "Gradient-based learning algorithms have an implicit \\emph{simplicity bias} which in effect can limit the diversity of predictors being sampled by the learning procedure. This behavior can hinder the transferability of trained models by (i) favoring the learning of simpler but spurious features --- present in the training data but absent from the test data --- and (ii) by only leveraging a small subset of predictive features.  Such an effect is especially magnified when the test distribution does not exactly match the train distribution---referred to as the Out of Distribution (OOD) generalization problem. However, given only the training data, it is not always possible to apriori assess if a given feature is spurious or transferable. Instead, we advocate for learning an ensemble of models which capture a diverse set of predictive features. Towards this, we propose a new algorithm D-BAT (Diversity-By-disAgreement Training), which enforces agreement among the models on the training data, but disagreement on the OOD data. We show how D-BAT naturally emerges from the notion of generalized discrepancy, as well as demonstrate in multiple experiments how the proposed method can mitigate shortcut-learning, enhance uncertainty and OOD detection, as well as improve transferability",

    "title": "Efficient Conditionally Invariant Representation Learning",
    "abstract": "We introduce the Conditional Independence Regression CovariancE (CIRCE), a measure of conditional independence for multivariate continuous-valued variables. CIRCE applies as a regularizer in settings where we wish to learn neural features \nφ\n(\nX\n)\n of data \nX\n to estimate a target \nY\n, while being conditionally independent of a distractor \nZ\n given \nY\n. Both \nZ\n and \nY\n are assumed to be continuous-valued but relatively low dimensional, whereas \nX\n and its features may be complex and high dimensional. Relevant settings include domain-invariant learning, fairness, and causal learning. The procedure requires just a single ridge regression from \nY\n to kernelized features of \nZ\n, which can be done in advance. It is then only necessary to enforce independence of \nφ\n(\nX\n)\n from residuals of this regression, which is possible with attractive estimation properties and consistency guarantees. By contrast, earlier measures of conditional feature dependence require multiple regressions for each step of feature learning, resulting in more severe bias and variance, and greater computational cost. When sufficiently rich features are used, we establish that CIRCE is zero if and only if \nφ\n(\nX\n)\n⊥\n⊥\nZ\n∣\nY\n. In experiments, we show superior performance to previous methods on challenging benchmarks, including learning conditionally invariant image features.

    "title": "Aligning Model and Macaque Inferior Temporal Cortex Representations Improves Model-to-Human Behavioral Alignment and Adversarial Robustness",
    "abstract": "While some state-of-the-art artificial neural network systems in computer vision are strikingly accurate models of the corresponding primate visual processing, there are still many discrepancies between these models and the behavior of primates on object recognition tasks. Many current models suffer from extreme sensitivity to adversarial attacks and often do not align well with the image-by-image behavioral error patterns observed in humans. Previous research has provided strong evidence that primate object recognition behavior can be very accurately predicted by neural population activity in the inferior temporal (IT) cortex, a brain area in the late stages of the visual processing hierarchy. Therefore, here we directly test whether making the late stage representations of models more similar to that of macaque IT produces new models that exhibit more robust, primate-like behavior. We conducted chronic, large-scale multi-electrode recordings  across the IT cortex in six non-human primates (rhesus macaques). We then use these data to fine-tune (end-to-end) the model \"IT\" representations such that they are more aligned with the biological IT representations, while preserving accuracy on object recognition tasks. We generate a cohort of models with a range of IT similarity scores validated on held-out animals across two image sets with distinct statistics. Across a battery of optimization conditions, we observed a strong correlation between the models' IT-likeness and alignment with human behavior, as well as an increase in its adversarial robustness. We further assessed the limitations of this approach and find that the improvements in behavioral alignment and adversarial robustness generalize across different image statistics, but not to object categories outside of those covered in our IT training set. Taken together, our results demonstrate that building models that are more aligned with the primate brain leads to more robust and human-like behavior, and call for larger neural data-sets to further augment these gains",

    "abstract": "Algorithmic reasoning requires capabilities which are most naturally understood through recurrent models of computation, like the Turing machine. However, Transformer models, while lacking recurrence, are able to perform such reasoning using far fewer layers than the number of reasoning steps. This raises the question: what solutions are these shallow and non-recurrent models finding? We investigate this question in the setting of learning automata, discrete dynamical systems naturally suited to recurrent modeling and expressing algorithmic tasks. Our theoretical results completely characterize shortcut solutions, whereby a shallow Transformer with only \no\n(\nT\n)\n layers can exactly replicate the computation of an automaton on an input sequence of length \nT\n. By representing automata using the algebraic structure of their underlying transformation semigroups, we obtain \nO\n(\nlog\n⁡\nT\n)\n-depth simulators for all automata and \nO\n(\n1\n)\n-depth simulators for all automata whose associated groups are solvable. Empirically, we perform synthetic experiments by training Transformers to simulate a wide variety of automata, and show that shortcut solutions can be learned via standard training. We further investigate the brittleness of these solutions and propose potential mitigations",

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have been shown to be capable of impressive few-shot generalisation to new tasks. However, they still tend to perform poorly on multi-step logical reasoning problems. Here we carry out a comprehensive evaluation of LLMs on 46 tasks that probe different aspects of logical reasoning. We show that language models tend to perform fairly well at single step inference or entailment tasks, but struggle to chain together multiple reasoning steps to solve more complex problems. In light of this, we propose a Selection-Inference (SI) framework that exploits pre-trained LLMs as general processing modules, and alternates between selection and inference to generate a series of interpretable, casual reasoning steps leading to the final answer. We show that a 7B parameter LLM used within the SI framework in a 5-shot generalisation setting, with no fine-tuning, yields a performance improvement of over 100% compared to an equivalent vanilla baseline on a suite of 10 logical reasoning tasks. The same model in the same setting even outperforms a significantly larger 280B parameter baseline on the same suite of tasks. Moreover, answers produced by the SI framework are accompanied by a causal natural-language-based reasoning trace, which has important implications for the safety and trustworthiness of the system",

    "abstract": "We consider robust clustering problems in \nR\nd\n, specifically \nk\n-clustering problems (e.g., \nk\n-Median and \nk\n-Means) with \nm\n \\emph{outliers}, where the cost for a given center set \nC\n⊂\nR\nd\n aggregates the distances from \nC\n to all but the furthest \nm\n data points, instead of all points as in classical clustering. We focus on the \nϵ\n-coreset for robust clustering, a small proxy of the dataset that preserves the clustering cost within \nϵ\n-relative error for all center sets. Our main result is an \nϵ\n-coreset of size \nO\n(\nm\n+\npoly\n(\nk\nϵ\n−\n1\n)\n)\n that can be constructed in near-linear time. This significantly improves previous results, which either suffers an exponential dependence on \n(\nm\n+\nk\n)\n [Feldman and Schulman, SODA'12], or has a weaker bi-criteria guarantee [Huang et al., FOCS'18]. Furthermore, we show this dependence in \nm\n is nearly-optimal, and the fact that it is isolated from other factors may be crucial for dealing with large number of outliers. We construct our coresets by adapting to the outlier setting a recent framework [Braverman et al., FOCS'22] which was designed for capacity-constrained clustering, overcoming a new challenge that the participating terms in the cost, particularly the excluded \nm\n outlier points, are dependent on the center set \nC\n. We validate our coresets on various datasets, and we observe a superior size-accuracy tradeoff compared with popular baselines including uniform sampling and sensitivity sampling. We also achieve a significant speedup of existing approximation algorithms for robust clustering using our coresets",

While self-play reinforcement learning has resulted in numerous successes in purely adversarial games like chess, Go, and poker, self-play alone is insufficient for achieving optimal performance in domains involving cooperation with humans. We address this shortcoming by first introducing a planning algorithm we call DiL-piKL that regularizes a reward-maximizing policy toward a human imitation-learned policy. We prove that this is a no-regret learning algorithm under a modified utility function. We then show that DiL-piKL can be extended into a self-play reinforcement learning algorithm we call RL-DiL-piKL that provides a model of human play while simultaneously training an agent that responds well to this human model. We used RL-DiL-piKL to train an agent we name Diplodocus.\nIn a 200-game no-press Diplomacy tournament involving 62 human participants spanning skill levels from beginner to expert, two Diplodocus agents both achieved a higher average score than all other participants who played more than two games, and ranked first and third according to an Elo ratings model",

This new framework reveals that exact softmax attention can be recovered from RFA by manipulating each control variate. Besides, it allows us to develop a more flexible form of control variates, resulting in a novel attention mechanism that significantly reduces the approximation gap while maintaining linear complexity.

By doing so, we avoid computing Q-values using out-of-distribution actions which is often a substantial source of error.

Using EVT, we derive our \\emph{Extreme Q-Learning} framework and consequently online and, for the first time, offline MaxEnt Q-learning algorithms, that do not explicitly require access to a policy or its entropy.

The new standard unveils many issues in existing approaches for low-light image enhancement (LLIE), especially in dealing with the intricate issue of joint luminance enhancement and noise removal while remaining efficient. Unlike existing methods that address the problem in the spatial domain, we propose a new solution, UHDFour, that embeds Fourier transform into a cascaded network. Our approach is motivated by a few unique characteristics in the Fourier domain:  1) most luminance information concentrates on amplitudes while noise is closely related to phases, and 2) a high-resolution image and its low-resolution version share similar amplitude patterns. Through embedding Fourier into our network, the amplitude and phase of a low-light image are separately processed to avoid amplifying noise when enhancing luminance. Besides, UHDFour is scalable to UHD images by implementing amplitude and phase enhancement under the low-resolution regime and then adjusting the high-resolution scale with few computations. We also contribute the first real UHD LLIE dataset, UHD-LL, that contains 2,150 low-noise/normal-clear 4K image pairs with diverse darkness and noise levels captured in different scenarios. With this dataset, we systematically analyze the performance of existing LLIE methods for processing UHD images and demonstrate the advantage of our solution. We believe our new framework, coupled with the dataset, would push the frontier of LLIE towards UHD. The code and dataset are available at https://li-chongyi.github.io/UHDFour/",

    "abstract": "Reliable application of machine learning-based decision systems in the wild is one of the major challenges currently investigated by the field. A large portion of established approaches aims to detect erroneous predictions by means of assigning confidence scores. This confidence may be obtained by either quantifying the model's predictive uncertainty, learning explicit scoring functions, or assessing whether the input is in line with the training distribution. Curiously, while these approaches all state to address the same eventual goal of detecting failures of a classifier upon real-world application, they currently constitute largely separated research fields with individual evaluation protocols, which either exclude a substantial part of relevant methods or ignore large parts of relevant failure sources. In this work, we systematically reveal current pitfalls caused by these inconsistencies and derive requirements for a holistic and realistic evaluation of failure detection. To demonstrate the relevance of this unified perspective, we present a large-scale empirical study for the first time enabling benchmarking confidence scoring functions w.r.t all relevant methods and failure sources. The revelation of a simple softmax response baseline as the overall best performing method underlines the drastic shortcomings of current evaluation in the plethora of publicized research on confidence scoring.

In this way, AdaSubS benefits from the efficiency of planning with longer-term subgoals and the fine control with shorter-term ones, and thus scales well to difficult planning problems.

    "abstract": "Graph neural networks (GNNs) for temporal graphs have recently attracted increasing attentions, where a common assumption is that the class set for nodes is closed. However, in real-world scenarios, it often faces the open set problem with the dynamically increased class set as the time passes by. This will bring two big challenges to the existing dynamic GNN methods: (i) How to dynamically propagate appropriate information in an open temporal graph, where new class nodes are often linked to old class nodes. This case will lead to a sharp contradiction. This is because typical GNNs are prone to make the embeddings of connected nodes become similar, while we expect the embeddings of these two interactive nodes to be distinguishable since they belong to different classes. (ii) How to avoid catastrophic knowledge forgetting over old classes when learning new classes occurred in temporal graphs. In this paper, we propose a general and principled learning approach for open temporal graphs, called OTGNet, with the goal of addressing the above two challenges. We assume the knowledge of a node can be disentangled into class-relevant and class-agnostic one, and thus explore a new message passing mechanism by extending the information bottleneck principle to only propagate class-agnostic knowledge between nodes of different classes, avoiding aggregating conflictive information. Moreover, we devise a strategy to select both important and diverse triad sub-graph structures for effective class-incremental learning.

However, factors such as the random weights initialization, training hyperparameters, or other sources of randomness in the training phase may induce incoherent latent spaces that hinder any form of reuse. Nevertheless, we empirically observe that, under the same data and modeling choices, the angles between the encodings within distinct latent spaces do not change. In this work, we propose the latent similarity between each sample and a fixed set of anchors as an alternative data representation, demonstrating that it can enforce the desired invariances without any additional training. We show how neural architectures can leverage these relative representations to guarantee, in practice, invariance to latent isometries and rescalings, effectively enabling latent space communication: from zero-shot model stitching to latent space comparison between diverse settings. We extensively validate the generalization capability of our approach on different datasets, spanning various modalities (images, text, graphs), tasks (e.g., classification, reconstruction) and architectures (e.g., CNNs, GCNs, transformers)",

    "title": "Language Modelling with Pixels",
    "abstract": "Language models are defined over a finite set of inputs, which creates a vocabulary bottleneck when we attempt to scale the number of supported languages. Tackling this bottleneck results in a trade-off between what can be represented in the embedding matrix and computational issues in the output layer. This paper introduces PIXEL, the Pixel-based Encoder of Language, which suffers from neither of these issues. PIXEL is a pretrained language model that renders text as images, making it possible to transfer representations across languages based on orthographic similarity or the co-activation of pixels. PIXEL is trained to reconstruct the pixels of masked patches instead of predicting a distribution over tokens. We pretrain the 86M parameter PIXEL model on the same English data as BERT and evaluate on syntactic and semantic tasks in typologically diverse languages, including various non-Latin scripts. We find that PIXEL substantially outperforms BERT on syntactic and semantic processing tasks on scripts that are not found in the pretraining data, but PIXEL is slightly weaker than BERT when working with Latin scripts. Furthermore, we find that PIXEL is more robust than BERT to orthographic attacks and linguistic code-switching, further confirming the benefits of modelling language with pixels",

We follow the strategy to compute several models using different hyper-parameters, and, to subsequently compute a linear aggregation of the models. While several heuristics exist that follow this strategy, methods are still missing that rely on thorough theories for bounding the target error. In this turn, we propose a method that extends weighted least squares to vector-valued functions, e.g., deep neural networks. We show that the target error of the proposed algorithm is asymptotically not worse than twice the error of the unknown optimal aggregation. We also perform a large scale empirical comparative study on several datasets, including text, images, electroencephalogram, body sensor signals and signals from mobile phones. Our method outperforms deep embedded validation (DEV) and importance weighted validation (IWV) on all datasets, setting a new state-of-the-art performance for solving parameter choice issues in unsupervised domain adaptation with theoretical error guarantees.

Distilling analytical expressions that govern nonlinear dynamics from limited data remains vital but challenging. To tackle this fundamental issue, we propose a novel Symbolic Physics Learner (SPL) machine to discover the mathematical structure of nonlinear dynamics. The key concept is to interpret mathematical operations and system state variables by computational rules and symbols, establish symbolic reasoning of mathematical formulas via expression trees, and employ a Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS) agent to explore optimal expression trees based on measurement data. The MCTS agent obtains an optimistic selection policy through the traversal of expression trees, featuring the one that maps to the arithmetic expression of underlying physics.

Methods that predict a single point estimate do not predict the pose of objects with symmetries well and cannot represent uncertainty. Alternatively, some works predict a distribution over orientations in \nSO\n(\n3\n)\n. However, training such models can be computation- and sample-inefficient. Instead, we propose a novel mapping of features from the image domain to the 3D rotation manifold.

In this work, we conduct explicit local-global feature alignment by leveraging global semantic knowledge for learning a better representation.

    "abstract": "While large-scale sequence modelling from offline data has led to impressive performance gains in natural language generation and image generation, directly translating such ideas to robotics has been challenging. One critical reason for this is that uncurated robot demonstration data, i.e. play data, collected from non-expert human demonstrators are often noisy, diverse, and distributionally multi-modal. This makes extracting useful, task-centric behaviors from such data a difficult generative modelling problem. In this work, we present Conditional Behavior Transformers (C-BeT), a method that combines the multi-modal generation ability of Behavior Transformer with future-conditioned goal specification. On a suite of simulated benchmark tasks, we find that C-BeT improves upon prior state-of-the-art work in learning from play data by an average of 45.7%. Further, we demonstrate for the first time that useful task-centric behaviors can be learned on a real-world robot purely from play data without any task labels or reward information.

    "abstract": "Variational autoencoders (VAEs) are powerful tools for learning latent representations of data used in a wide range of applications. In practice, VAEs usually require multiple training rounds to choose the amount of information the latent variable should retain. This trade-off between the reconstruction error (distortion) and the KL divergence (rate) is typically parameterized by a hyperparameter \nβ\n. In this paper, we introduce Multi-Rate VAE (MR-VAE), a computationally efficient framework for learning optimal parameters corresponding to various \nβ\n in a single training run. The key idea is to explicitly formulate a response function using hypernetworks that maps \nβ\n to the optimal parameters. MR-VAEs construct a compact response hypernetwork where the pre-activations are conditionally gated based on \nβ\n. We justify the proposed architecture by analyzing linear VAEs and showing that it can represent response functions exactly for linear VAEs. With the learned hypernetwork, MR-VAEs can construct the rate-distortion curve without additional training and can be deployed with significantly less hyperparameter tuning. Empirically, our approach is competitive and often exceeds the performance of multiple \nβ\n-VAEs training with minimal computation and memory overheads",

    "abstract": "Antibody design is valuable for therapeutic usage and biological research. Existing deep-learning-based methods encounter several key issues: 1) incomplete context for Complementarity-Determining Regions (CDRs) generation; 2) incapability of capturing the entire 3D geometry of the input structure; 3) inefficient prediction of the CDR sequences in an autoregressive manner. In this paper, we propose Multi-channel Equivariant Attention Network (MEAN) to co-design 1D sequences and 3D structures of CDRs. To be specific, MEAN formulates antibody design as a conditional graph translation problem by importing extra components including the target antigen and the light chain of the antibody. Then, MEAN resorts to E(3)-equivariant message passing along with a proposed attention mechanism to better capture the geometrical correlation between different components. Finally, it outputs both the 1D sequences and 3D structure via a multi-round progressive full-shot scheme, which enjoys more efficiency and precision against previous autoregressive approaches. Our method significantly surpasses state-of-the-art models in sequence and structure modeling, antigen-binding CDR design, and binding affinity optimization. Specifically, the relative improvement to baselines is about 23\\% in antigen-binding CDR design and 34\\% for affinity optimization",

    "title": "Tailoring Language Generation Models under Total Variation Distance",
    "abstract": "The standard paradigm of neural language generation adopts maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) as the optimizing method. From a distributional view, MLE in fact minimizes the Kullback-Leibler divergence (KLD) between the distribution of the real data and that of the model. However, this approach forces the model to distribute non-zero (sometimes large) probability mass to all training samples regardless of their quality. Moreover, in the attempt to cover the low-probability regions in the data distribution, the model systematically overestimates the probability of corrupted text sequences, which we conjecture is one of the main reasons for text degeneration during autoregressive decoding. To remedy this problem, we leverage the total variation distance (TVD) with its robustness to outliers, and develop practical bounds to apply it to language generation. Then, we introduce the TaiLr objective that balances the tradeoff of estimating TVD. Intuitively, TaiLr downweights real data samples that have low model probabilities with tunable penalization intensity. Experimental results show that our method alleviates the overestimation of degenerated sequences without sacrificing diversity and improves generation quality on a wide range of text generation tasks",

    "abstract": "Deep generative models parametrized up to a normalizing constant (e.g. energy-based models) are difficult to train by maximizing the likelihood of the data because the likelihood and/or gradients thereof cannot be explicitly or efficiently written down. Score matching is a training method, whereby instead of fitting the likelihood \nlog\n⁡\np\n(\nx\n)\n for the training data, we instead fit the score function \n∇\nx\nlog\n⁡\np\n(\nx\n)\n --- obviating the need to evaluate the partition function. Though this estimator is known to be consistent, its unclear whether (and when) its statistical efficiency is comparable to that of maximum likelihood --- which is known to be (asymptotically) optimal. We initiate this line of inquiry in this paper, and show a tight connection between statistical efficiency of score matching and the isoperimetric properties of the distribution being estimated --- i.e. the Poincar\\'e, log-Sobolev and isoperimetric constant --- quantities which govern the mixing time of Markov processes like Langevin dynamics. Roughly, we show that the score matching estimator is statistically comparable to the maximum likelihood when the  distribution has a small isoperimetric constant. Conversely, if the distribution has a large isoperimetric constant --- even for simple families of distributions like exponential families with rich enough sufficient statistics --- score matching will be substantially less efficient than maximum likelihood. We suitably formalize these results both in the finite sample regime, and in the asymptotic regime. Finally, we identify a direct parallel in the discrete setting, where we connect the statistical properties of pseudolikelihood estimation with approximate tensorization of entropy and the Glauber dynamics",

It is the first point-based method that achieves better visual quality than NeRF while being 100× faster in rendering speed. Our approach builds on existing works on differentiable point-based rendering but introduces a novel technique we call “Sculpted Neural Points (SNP)”, which significantly improves the robustness to errors and holes in the reconstructed point cloud. We further propose to use view-dependent point features based on spherical harmonics to capture non-Lambertian surfaces, and new designs in the point-based rendering pipeline that further boost the performance.

    "abstract": "Although Transformer architectures have been successfully applied to graph data with the advent of Graph Transformer, current design of Graph Transformer still heavily relies on human labor and expertise knowledge to decide proper neural architectures and suitable graph encoding strategies at each Transformer layer. In literature, there have been some works on automated design of Transformers focusing on non-graph data such as texts and images without considering graph encoding strategies, which fail to handle the non-euclidean graph data. In this paper, we study the problem of automated graph Transformer, for the first time. However, solving these problems poses the following challenges: i) how can we design a unified search space for graph Transformer, and ii) how to deal with the coupling relations between Transformer architectures and the graph encodings of each Transformer layer. To address these challenges, we propose Automated Graph Transformer (AutoGT), a neural architecture search framework that can automatically discover the optimal graph Transformer architectures by joint optimization of Transformer architecture and graph encoding strategies. Specifically, we first propose a unified graph Transformer formulation that can represent most of state-of-the-art graph Transformer architectures. Based upon the unified formulation, we further design the graph Transformer search space that includes both candidate architectures and various graph encodings. To handle the coupling relations, we propose a novel encoding-aware performance estimation strategy by gradually training and splitting the supernets according to the correlations between graph encodings and architectures. The proposed strategy can provide a more consistent and fine-grained performance prediction when evaluating the jointly optimized graph encodings and architectures. Extensive experiments and ablation studies show that our proposed AutoGT gains sufficient improvement over state-of-the-art hand-crafted baselines on all datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness and wide applicability",

However, gradients in MLO, which are obtained by composing best-response Jacobians via the chain rule, are notoriously difficult to implement and memory/compute intensive. We take an initial step towards closing this gap by introducing Betty, a software library for large-scale MLO. At its core, we devise a novel dataflow graph for MLO, which allows us to (1) develop efficient automatic differentiation for MLO that reduces the computational complexity from \nO\n(\nd\n3\n)\n to \nO\n(\nd\n2\n)\n, (2) incorporate systems support such as mixed-precision and data-parallel training for scalability, and (3) facilitate implementation of MLO programs of arbitrary complexity while allowing a modular interface for diverse algorithmic and systems design choices. We empirically demonstrate that Betty can be used to implement an array of MLO programs, while also observing up to 11% increase in test accuracy, 14% decrease in GPU memory usage, and 20% decrease in training wall time over existing implementations on multiple benchmarks. We also showcase that Betty enables scaling MLO to models with hundreds of millions of parameters. We open-source the code at https://github.com/leopard-ai/betty",

To this end, we   propose an effective and general   {Weight-decay-Integrated Nesterov acceleration} (Win) to accelerate adaptive  algorithms. Taking AdamW and Adam as examples,  we minimize a dynamical   loss per iteration which combines the vanilla training loss and a dynamic regularizer inspired by proximal point method (PPM) to improve the convexity of the problem. To introduce Nesterov-alike-acceleration into AdamW and Adam,  we respectively  use the  first- and second-order Taylor approximations of vanilla loss  to  update the variable  twice. In this way,  we arrive at  our Win acceleration  for AdamW and Adam that uses  a conservative step  and a  reckless step to update twice and then linearly combines these two updates for acceleration. Next,  we  extend  Win acceleration to LAMB and SGD. Our transparent acceleration derivation  could  provide insights for  other accelerated methods and their integration into  adaptive algorithms.  Besides, we prove the convergence of Win-accelerated adaptive  algorithms and  justify their convergence superiority over their non-accelerated counterparts by taking AdamW and Adam as examples.  Experimental results testify to the faster convergence speed and superior performance of our Win-accelerated AdamW, Adam, LAMB and SGD over their non-accelerated counterparts on vision classification tasks and  language modeling tasks with both CNN and Transformer backbones.  We hope Win  shall be a default acceleration option for  popular optimizers in deep learning community to improve the training efficiency.

To address these issues, we propose MocoSFL, a collaborative SSL framework based on Split Federated Learning (SFL) and Momentum Contrast (MoCo). In MocoSFL, the large backbone model is split into a small client-side model and a large server-side model, and only the small client-side model is processed locally on the client's local devices. MocoSFL has three key components: (i) vector concatenation which enables the use of small batch size and reduces computation and memory requirements by orders of magnitude; (ii) feature sharing that helps achieve high accuracy regardless of the quality and volume of local data; (iii) frequent synchronization that helps achieve better non-IID performance because of smaller local model divergence. For a 1,000-client case with non-IID data (each client only has data from 2 random classes of CIFAR-10), MocoSFL can achieve over 84% accuracy with ResNet-18 model. Next we present TAResSFL module that significantly improves the resistance to privacy threats and communication overhead with small sacrifice in accuracy for a MocoSFL system. On a Raspberry Pi 4B device, the MocoSFL-based scheme requires less than 1MB of memory and less than 40MB of communication, and consumes less than 5W power.

    "abstract": "All existing 3D-from-2D generators are designed for well-curated single-category datasets, where all the objects have (approximately) the same scale, 3D location, and orientation, and the camera always points to the center of the scene. This makes them inapplicable to diverse, in-the-wild datasets of non-alignable scenes rendered from arbitrary camera poses. In this work, we develop a 3D generator with Generic Priors (3DGP): a 3D synthesis framework with more general assumptions about the training data, and show that it scales to very challenging datasets, like ImageNet. Our model is based on three new ideas. First, we incorporate an inaccurate off-the-shelf depth estimator into 3D GAN training via a special depth adaptation module to handle the imprecision. Then, we create a flexible camera model and a regularization strategy for it to learn its distribution parameters during training. Finally, we extend the recent ideas of transferring knowledge from pretrained classifiers into GANs for patch-wise trained models by employing a simple distillation-based technique on top of the discriminator. It achieves more stable training than the existing methods and speeds up the convergence by at least 40%. We explore our model on four datasets: SDIP Dogs \n256\n2\n, SDIP Elephants \n256\n2\n, LSUN Horses \n256\n2\n, and ImageNet \n256\n2\n and demonstrate that 3DGP outperforms the recent state-of-the-art in terms of both texture and geometry quality.

    "abstract": "Human visual perception can easily generalize to out-of-distributed visual data, which is far beyond the capability of modern machine learning models. Domain generalization (DG) aims to close this gap, with existing DG methods mainly focusing on the loss function design. In this paper, we propose to explore an orthogonal direction, i.e., the design of the backbone architecture. It is motivated by an empirical finding that transformer-based models trained with empirical risk minimization (ERM) outperform CNN-based models employing state-of-the-art (SOTA) DG algorithms on multiple DG datasets. We develop a formal framework to characterize a network's robustness to distribution shifts by studying its architecture's alignment with the correlations in the dataset. This analysis guides us to propose a novel DG model built upon vision transformers, namely \\emph{Generalizable Mixture-of-Experts (GMoE)}. Extensive experiments on DomainBed demonstrate that GMoE trained with ERM outperforms SOTA DG baselines by a large margin. Moreover, GMoE is complementary to existing DG methods and its performance is substantially improved when trained with DG algorithms",

    "abstract": "We introduce Token Merging (ToMe), a simple method to increase the throughput of existing ViT models without needing to train. ToMe gradually combines similar tokens in a transformer using a general and light-weight matching algorithm that is as fast as pruning while being more accurate. Off-the-shelf, ToMe can 2x the throughput of state-of-the-art ViT-L @ 512 and ViT-H @ 518 models on images and 2.2x the throughput of ViT-L on video with only a 0.2-0.3% accuracy drop in each case. ToMe can also easily be applied during training, improving in practice training speed up to 2x for MAE fine-tuning on video. Training with ToMe further minimizes accuracy drop, leading to 2x the throughput of ViT-B on audio for only a 0.4% mAP drop. Qualitatively, we find that ToMe merges object parts into one token, even over multiple frames of video. Overall, ToMe’s accuracy and speed are competitive with state-of-the-art on images, video, and audio",

    "title": "Learnable Behavior Control: Breaking Atari Human World Records via Sample-Efficient Behavior Selection",
    "abstract": "The exploration problem is one of the main challenges in deep reinforcement learning (RL). Recent promising works tried to handle the problem with population-based methods, which collect samples with diverse behaviors derived from a population of different exploratory policies. Adaptive policy selection has been adopted for behavior control. However, the behavior selection space is largely limited by the predefined policy population, which further limits behavior diversity.  In this paper, we propose a general framework called Learnable Behavioral Control (LBC) to address the limitation, which a) enables a significantly enlarged behavior selection space via formulating a hybrid behavior mapping from all policies; b) constructs a unified learnable process for behavior selection. We introduce LBC into distributed off-policy actor-critic methods and achieve behavior control via optimizing the selection of the behavior mappings with bandit-based meta-controllers. Our agents have achieved 10077.52% mean human normalized score and surpassed 24 human world records within 1B training frames in the Arcade Learning Environment, which demonstrates our significant state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance without degrading the sample efficiency",

In this work, we introduce a straightforward and promising paradigm for visual representation, which is called Context Clusters. Context clusters (CoCs) view an image as a set of unorganized points and extract features via a simplified clustering algorithm. In detail, each point includes the raw feature (e.g., color) and positional information (e.g., coordinates), and a simplified clustering algorithm is employed to group and extract deep features hierarchically. Our CoCs are convolution- and attention-free, only relying on clustering algorithm for spatial interaction. Owing to the simple design, we show CoCs endow gratifying interpretability via the visualization of the clustering process.  \nOur CoCs aim at providing a new perspective on image and visual representation, which may enjoy broad applications in different domains and exhibit profound insights. Even though we are not targeting SOTA performance, COCs still achieve comparable or even better performance than ConvNets or ViTs on several benchmarks",

    "title": "Human-Guided Fair Classification for Natural Language Processing",
    "abstract": "Text classifiers have promising applications in high-stake tasks such as resume screening and content moderation. These classifiers must be fair and avoid discriminatory decisions by being invariant to perturbations of sensitive attributes such as gender or ethnicity. However, there is a gap between human intuition about these perturbations and the formal similarity specifications capturing them. While existing research has started to address this gap, current methods are based on hardcoded word replacements, resulting in specifications with limited expressivity or ones that fail to fully align with human intuition (e.g., in cases of asymmetric counterfactuals). This work proposes novel methods for bridging this gap by discovering expressive and intuitive individual fairness specifications. We show how to leverage unsupervised style transfer and GPT-3's zero-shot capabilities to automatically generate expressive candidate pairs of semantically similar sentences that differ along sensitive attributes. We then validate the generated pairs via an extensive crowdsourcing study, which confirms that a lot of these pairs align with human intuition about fairness in the context of toxicity classification. Finally, we show how limited amounts of human feedback can be leveraged to learn a similarity specification that can be used to train downstream fairness-aware models",

    "title": "Humanly Certifying Superhuman Classifiers",
    "abstract": "This paper addresses a key question in current machine learning research: if we believe that a model's predictions might be better than those given by human experts, how can we (humans) verify these beliefs? In some cases, this ``superhuman'' performance is readily demonstrated; for example by defeating top-tier human players in traditional two player games. On the other hand, it can be challenging to evaluate classification models that potentially surpass human performance. Indeed, human annotations are often treated as a ground truth, which implicitly assumes the superiority of the human over any models trained on human annotations. In reality, human annotators are subjective and can make mistakes. Evaluating the performance with respect to a genuine oracle is more objective and reliable, even when querying the oracle is more expensive or sometimes impossible. In this paper, we first raise the challenge of evaluating the performance of both humans and models with respect to an oracle which is \nunobserved\n. We develop a theory for estimating the accuracy compared to the oracle, using only imperfect human annotations for reference. Our analysis provides an executable recipe for detecting and certifying superhuman performance in this setting, which we believe will assist in understanding the stage of current research on classification. We validate the convergence of the bounds and the assumptions of our theory on carefully designed toy experiments with known oracles. Moreover, we demonstrate the utility of our theory by meta-analyzing large-scale natural language processing tasks, for which an oracle does not exist, and show that under our mild assumptions a number of models from recent years have already achieved superhuman performance with high probability---suggesting that our new oracle based performance evaluation metrics are overdue as an alternative to the widely used accuracy metrics that are naively based on imperfect human annotations",

    "title": "Few-Shot Domain Adaptation For End-to-End Communication",
    "abstract": "The problem of end-to-end learning of a communication system using an autoencoder -- consisting of an encoder, channel, and decoder modeled using neural networks -- has recently been shown to be an effective approach. A challenge faced in the practical adoption of this learning approach is that under changing channel conditions (e.g. a wireless link), it requires frequent retraining of the autoencoder in order to maintain a low decoding error rate. Since retraining is both time consuming and requires a large number of samples, it becomes impractical when the channel distribution is changing quickly. We propose to address this problem using a fast and sample-efficient (few-shot) domain adaptation method that does not change the encoder and decoder networks. Different from conventional training-time unsupervised or semi-supervised domain adaptation, here we have a trained autoencoder from a source distribution that we want to adapt (at test time) to a target distribution using only a small labeled dataset, and no unlabeled data. We focus on a generative channel model based on the Gaussian mixture density network (MDN), and propose a regularized, parameter-efficient adaptation of the MDN using a set of affine transformations. The learned affine transformations are then used to design an optimal transformation at the decoder input to compensate for the distribution shift, and effectively present to the decoder inputs close to the source distribution. Experiments on many simulated distribution changes common to the wireless setting, and a real mmWave FPGA testbed demonstrate the effectiveness of our method at adaptation using very few target domain samples~\\footnote{Code for our work: \\url{https://github.com/jayaram-r/domain-adaptation-autoencoder}}",

    "title": "Learning a Data-Driven Policy Network for Pre-Training Automated Feature Engineering",
    "abstract": "Feature engineering is widely acknowledged to be pivotal in tabular data analysis and prediction. Automated feature engineering (AutoFE) emerged to automate this process managed by experienced data scientists and engineers conventionally. In this area, most — if not all — prior work adopted an identical framework from the neural architecture search (NAS) method. While feasible, we posit that the NAS framework very much contradicts the way how human experts cope with the data since the inherent Markov decision process (MDP) setup differs. We point out that its data-unobserved setup consequentially results in an incapability to generalize across different datasets as well as also high computational cost. This paper proposes a novel AutoFE framework Feature Set Data-Driven Search (FETCH), a pipeline mainly for feature generation and selection. Notably, FETCH is built on a brand-new data-driven MDP setup using the tabular dataset as the state fed into the policy network. Further, we posit that the crucial merit of FETCH is its transferability where the yielded policy network trained on a variety of datasets is indeed capable to enact feature engineering on unseen data, without requiring additional exploration. To the best of our knowledge, this is a pioneer attempt to build a tabular data pre-training paradigm via AutoFE. Extensive experiments show that FETCH systematically surpasses the current state-of-the-art AutoFE methods and validates the transferability of AutoFE pre-training",

These subset sizes are rarely explicitly learned - be it the cluster sizes in clustering applications or the number of shared versus independent generative latent factors in weakly-supervised learning. Probability distributions over correct combinations of subset sizes are non-differentiable due to hard constraints, which prohibit gradient-based optimization. In this work, we propose the differentiable hypergeometric distribution. The hypergeometric distribution models the probability of different group sizes based on their relative importance. We introduce reparameterizable gradients to learn the importance between groups and highlight the advantage of explicitly learning the size of subsets in two typical applications: weakly-supervised learning and clustering. In both applications, we outperform previous approaches, which rely on suboptimal heuristics to model the unknown size of groups",

    "title": "Neuroevolution is a Competitive Alternative to Reinforcement Learning for Skill Discovery",
    "abstract": "Deep Reinforcement Learning (RL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for training neural policies to solve complex control tasks. However, these policies tend to be overfit to the exact specifications of the task and environment they were trained on, and thus do not perform well when conditions deviate slightly or when composed hierarchically to solve even more complex tasks. Recent work has shown that training a mixture of policies, as opposed to a single one, that are driven to explore different regions of the state-action space can address this shortcoming by generating a diverse set of behaviors, referred to as skills, that can be collectively used to great effect in adaptation tasks or for hierarchical planning. This is typically realized by including a diversity term - often derived from information theory - in the objective function optimized by RL. However these approaches often require careful hyperparameter tuning to be effective. In this work, we demonstrate that less widely-used neuroevolution methods, specifically Quality Diversity (QD), are a competitive alternative to information-theory-augmented RL for skill discovery. Through an extensive empirical evaluation comparing eight state-of-the-art algorithms (four flagship algorithms from each line of work) on the basis of (i) metrics directly evaluating the skills' diversity, (ii) the skills' performance on adaptation tasks, and (iii) the skills' performance when used as primitives for hierarchical planning; QD methods are found to provide equal, and sometimes improved, performance whilst being less sensitive to hyperparameters and more scalable. As no single method is found to provide near-optimal performance across all environments, there is a rich scope for further research which we support by proposing future directions and providing optimized open-source implementations",

In this work, we investigate the implicit bias of gradient flow and gradient descent in two-layer fully-connected neural networks with leaky ReLU activations when the training data are nearly-orthogonal, a common property of high-dimensional data.  For gradient flow, we leverage recent work on the implicit bias for homogeneous neural networks to show that asymptotically, gradient flow produces a neural network with rank at most two.  Moreover, this network is an \nℓ\n2\n-max-margin solution (in parameter space), and has a linear decision boundary that corresponds to an approximate-max-margin linear predictor.  For gradient descent, provided the random initialization variance is small enough, we show that a single step of gradient descent suffices to drastically reduce the rank of the network, and that the rank remains small throughout training.  We provide experiments which suggest that a small initialization scale is important for finding low-rank neural networks with gradient descent",

    "abstract": "The Teacher-Student Framework (TSF) is a reinforcement learning setting where a teacher agent guards the training of a student agent by intervening and providing online demonstrations. Assuming optimal, the teacher policy has the perfect timing and capability to intervene in the learning process of the student agent, providing safety guarantee and exploration guidance. Nevertheless, in many real-world settings it is expensive or even impossible to obtain a well-performing teacher policy. In this work, we relax the assumption of a well-performing teacher and develop a new method that can incorporate arbitrary teacher policies with modest or inferior performance. We instantiate an Off-Policy Reinforcement Learning algorithm, termed Teacher-Student Shared Control (TS2C), which incorporates teacher intervention based on trajectory-based value estimation. Theoretical analysis validates that the proposed TS2C algorithm attains efficient exploration and substantial safety guarantee without being affected by the teacher's own performance. Experiments on various continuous control tasks show that our method can exploit teacher policies at different performance levels while maintaining a low training cost. Moreover, the student policy surpasses the imperfect teacher policy in terms of higher accumulated reward in held-out testing environments. Code is available at https://metadriverse.github.io/TS2C",

Specifically, we address the shortcut satisfaction issue by introducing dual variables for logical connectives, encoding how the constraint is satisfied. We further propose a variational framework where the encoded logical constraint is expressed as a distributional loss that is compatible with the model's original training loss. The theoretical analysis shows that the proposed approach bears some nice properties, and the experimental evaluations demonstrate its superior performance in both model generalizability and constraint satisfaction",

This regret is built upon a sequence-wise extension of the commonly used discrepancy metric Pareto suboptimality gap in zero-order multi-objective bandits. We then derive an equivalent form of the regret, making it amenable to be optimized via first-order iterative methods. To motivate the algorithm design, we give an explicit example in which equipping OMD with the vanilla min-norm solver for gradient composition will incur a linear regret, which shows that merely regularizing the iterates, as in single-objective online learning, is not enough to guarantee sublinear regrets in the multi-objective setting. To resolve this issue, we propose a novel min-regularized-norm solver that regularizes the composite weights. Combining min-regularized-norm with OMD results in the Doubly Regularized Online Mirror Multiple Descent algorithm. We further derive the multi-objective regret bound for the proposed algorithm, which matches the optimal bound in the single-objective setting.

This situation brings significant obstacles to existing imitation learning approaches, since most of them learn policies under homogeneous observation spaces. On the other hand, previous studies under different observation spaces have strong assumptions that these two observation spaces coexist during the entire learning process. However, in reality, the observation coexistence will be limited due to the high cost of acquiring expert observations. In this work, we study this challenging problem with limited observation coexistence under heterogeneous observations: Heterogeneously Observable Imitation Learning (HOIL). We identify two underlying issues in HOIL: the dynamics mismatch and the support mismatch, and further propose the Importance Weighting with REjection (IWRE) algorithm based on importance weighting and learning with rejection to solve HOIL problems. Experimental results show that IWRE can solve various HOIL tasks, including the challenging tasks of transforming the vision-based demonstrations to random access memory (RAM)-based policies in the Atari domain, even with limited visual observations",

In this work, we make a key observation that knowing how changes in the underlying rewards affect the optimal behavior allows one to solve a variety of aforementioned problems. To a local approximation, this quantity is precisely captured by what we term the Bellman score, i.e gradient of log probabilities of the optimal policy with respect to the reward. We introduce the Bellman score operator which provably converges to the gradient of the infinite-horizon optimal Q-values with respect to the reward which can then be used to directly estimate the score. Guided by our theory, we derive a practical score-learning algorithm which can be used for score estimation in high-dimensional state-actions spaces. We show that score-learning can be used to reliably identify rewards, perform counterfactual predictions, achieve state-of-the-art behavior imitation, and transfer policies across environments",

    "abstract": "Learning with few labeled tabular samples is often an essential requirement for industrial machine learning applications as varieties of tabular data suffer from high annotation costs or have difficulties in collecting new samples for novel tasks. Despite the utter importance, such a problem is quite under-explored in the field of tabular learning, and existing few-shot learning schemes from other domains are not straightforward to apply, mainly due to the heterogeneous characteristics of tabular data. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective framework for few-shot semi-supervised tabular learning, coined Self-generated Tasks from UNlabeled Tables (STUNT). Our key idea is to self-generate diverse few-shot tasks by treating randomly chosen columns as a target label. We then employ a meta-learning scheme to learn generalizable knowledge with the constructed tasks. Moreover, we introduce an unsupervised validation scheme for hyperparameter search (and early stopping) by generating a pseudo-validation set using STUNT from unlabeled data. Our experimental results demonstrate that our simple framework brings significant performance gain under various tabular few-shot learning benchmarks, compared to prior semi- and self-supervised baselines.

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) transfer well to new tasks out-of-the-box simply given a natural language prompt that demonstrates how to perform the task and no additional training. Prompting is a brittle process wherein small modifications to the prompt can cause large variations in the model predictions, and therefore significant effort is dedicated towards designing a painstakingly crafted \"perfect prompt\" for a task. To mitigate the high degree of effort, we instead ask whether collecting multiple decent, yet imperfect, prompts and aggregating them can lead to a high quality prompting strategy. Our observations motivate our proposed method, Ask Me Anything (AMA). We first develop an understanding of the effective prompt formats, finding question-answering (QA) prompts, which encourage open-ended generation (\"Who went to the park?\") tend to outperform those that restrict the model outputs (\"John went to the park. True or False?\"). AMA recursively uses the LLM to transform task inputs to the effective QA format. AM generates multiple questions per input and applies these prompts to collect several noisy \"votes\" for the input's true label. We find the prompts have varying accuracies and dependencies and thus propose to use weak supervision, a procedure for combining the noisy predictions, to produce the final predictions. We evaluate AMA across open-source model families (EleutherAI, BLOOM, OPT, and T0) and sizes (125M-175B parameters), demonstrating an average performance lift of 10.2\\% over the few-shot baseline. This simple strategy enables the open-source GPT-J-6B model to match and exceed the performance of few-shot GPT3-175B  on 15 of 20 popular benchmarks.

    "title": "On Representing Linear Programs by Graph Neural Networks",
    "abstract": "Learning to optimize is a rapidly growing area that aims to solve optimization problems or improve existing optimization algorithms using machine learning (ML). In particular, the graph neural network (GNN) is considered a suitable ML model for optimization problems whose variables and constraints are permutation--invariant, for example, the linear program (LP). While the literature has reported encouraging numerical results, this paper establishes the theoretical foundation of applying GNNs to solving LPs. Given any size limit of LPs, we construct a GNN that maps different LPs to different outputs. We show that properly built GNNs can reliably predict feasibility, boundedness, and an optimal solution for each LP in a broad class. Our proofs are based upon the recently--discovered connections between the Weisfeiler--Lehman isomorphism test and the GNN. To validate our results, we train a simple GNN and present its accuracy in mapping LPs to their feasibilities and solutions",

    "title": "Scale-invariant Bayesian Neural Networks with Connectivity Tangent Kernel",
    "abstract": "Studying the loss landscapes of neural networks is critical to identifying generalizations and avoiding overconfident predictions. Flatness, which measures the perturbation resilience of pre-trained parameters for loss values, is widely acknowledged as an essential predictor of generalization. While the concept of flatness has been formalized as a PAC-Bayes bound, it has been observed that the generalization bounds can vary arbitrarily depending on the scale of the model parameters. Despite previous attempts to address this issue, generalization bounds remain vulnerable to function-preserving scaling transformations or are limited to impractical network structures. In this paper, we introduce new PAC-Bayes prior and posterior distributions invariant to scaling transformations, achieved through the \\textit{decomposition of perturbations into scale and connectivity components}. In this way, this approach expands the range of networks to which the resulting generalization bound can be applied, including those with practical transformations such as weight decay with batch normalization. Moreover, we demonstrate that scale-dependency issues of flatness can adversely affect the uncertainty calibration of Laplace approximation, and we propose a solution using our invariant posterior. Our proposed invariant posterior allows for effective measurement of flatness and calibration with low complexity while remaining invariant to practical parameter transformations, also applying it as a reliable predictor of neural network generalization",

Here, the main challenge is how to construct diverse tasks for meta-learning without label information; recent works have proposed to create, e.g., pseudo-labeling via pretrained representations or creating synthetic samples via generative models. However, such a task construction strategy is fundamentally limited due to heavy reliance on the immutable pseudo-labels during meta-learning and the quality of the representations or the generated samples. To overcome the limitations, we propose a simple yet effective unsupervised meta-learning framework, coined Pseudo-supervised Contrast (PsCo), for few-shot classification. We are inspired by the recent self-supervised learning literature; PsCo utilizes a momentum network and a queue of previous batches to improve pseudo-labeling and construct diverse tasks in a progressive manner. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that PsCo outperforms existing unsupervised meta-learning methods under various in-domain and cross-domain few-shot classification benchmarks. We also validate that PsCo is easily scalable to a large-scale benchmark, while recent prior-art meta-schemes are not",

    "title": "Guiding Energy-based Models via Contrastive Latent Variables",
    "abstract": "An energy-based model (EBM) is a popular generative framework that offers both explicit density and architectural flexibility, but training them is difficult since it is often unstable and time-consuming. In recent years, various training techniques have been developed, e.g., better divergence measures or stabilization in MCMC sampling, but there often exists a large gap between EBMs and other generative frameworks like GANs in terms of generation quality. In this paper, we propose a novel and effective framework for improving EBMs via contrastive representation learning (CRL). To be specific, we consider representations learned by contrastive methods as the true underlying latent variable. This contrastive latent variable could guide EBMs to understand the data structure better, so it can improve and accelerate EBM training significantly. To enable the joint training of EBM and CRL, we also design a new class of latent-variable EBMs for learning the joint density of data and the contrastive latent variable. Our experimental results demonstrate that our scheme achieves lower FID scores, compared to prior-art EBM methods (e.g., additionally using variational autoencoders or diffusion techniques), even with significantly faster and more memory-efficient training. We also show conditional and compositional generation abilities of our latent-variable EBMs as their additional benefits, even without explicit conditional training.

A natural question to ask is \\textit{Does the momentum parameter \nβ\n (say) play a role in implicit regularization in Heavy-ball (H.B) momentum accelerated gradient descent (GD+M)?}. To answer this question, first, we show that  the trajectory traced by discrete H.B momentum update (GD+M) is \nO\n(\nh\n2\n)\n close to a continuous trajectory induced by a modified loss, which consists of an original loss and an implicit regularizer. This implicit regularizer for (GD+M) is indeed stronger than that of (GD) by factor of \n(\n1\n+\nβ\n1\n−\nβ\n)\n, thus explaining why (GD+M) shows better generalization performance and higher test accuracy than (GD). Furthermore, we extend our analysis to stochastic version of gradient descent with momentum (SGD+M) and propose a deterministic continuous trajectory that is \nO\n(\nh\n2\n)\n close to the discrete update of (SGD+M) in a strong approximation sense.

    "abstract": "Motivated by the fact that forward and backward passes of a deep network naturally form symmetric mappings between input and output representations, we introduce a simple yet effective self-supervised vision model pretraining framework inspired by energy-based models (EBMs). In the proposed framework, we model energy estimation and data restoration as the forward and backward passes of a single network without any auxiliary components, e.g., an extra decoder. For the forward pass, we fit a network to an energy function that assigns low energy scores to samples that belong to an unlabeled dataset, and high energy otherwise. For the backward pass, we restore data from corrupted versions iteratively using gradient-based optimization along the direction of energy minimization. In this way, we naturally fold the encoder-decoder architecture widely used in masked image modeling into the forward and backward passes of a single vision model. Our framework accepts a wide range of pretext tasks with different data corruption methods, and permits models to be pretrained from masked image modeling, patch sorting, and image restoration, including super-resolution, denoising, and colorization. We support our findings with extensive experiments, and show the proposed method delivers comparable and even better performance with remarkably fewer epochs of training compared to the state-of-the-art self-supervised vision model pretraining methods.

Instead of constructing a non-Markov noising process as in the original DDIM, we examine the mechanism of DDIM from a numerical perspective.  We discover that the DDIM can be obtained by using some specific approximations of the score when solving the corresponding stochastic differential equation. We present an interpretation of the accelerating effects of DDIM that also explains the advantages of a deterministic sampling scheme over the stochastic one for fast sampling. Building on this insight, we extend DDIM to general DMs, coined generalized DDIM (gDDIM), with a small but delicate modification in parameterizing the score network. We validate gDDIM in two non-isotropic DMs: Blurring diffusion model (BDM) and Critically-damped Langevin diffusion model (CLD). We observe more than 20 times acceleration in BDM. In the CLD, a diffusion model by augmenting the diffusion process with velocity, our algorithm achieves an FID score of 2.26, on CIFAR10, with only 50 number of score function evaluations~(NFEs) and an FID score of 2.86 with only 27 NFEs",

Recent work has sought to generalize the vanilla averaging in FedAvg to a generalized gradient descent step by treating client updates as pseudo-gradients and using a server step size. While the use of a server step size has been shown to provide performance improvement theoretically, the practical benefit of the server step size has not been seen in most existing works. In this work, we present FedExP, a method to adaptively determine the server step size in FL based on dynamically varying pseudo-gradients throughout the FL process. We begin by considering the overparameterized convex regime, where we reveal an interesting similarity between FedAvg and the Projection Onto Convex Sets (POCS) algorithm. We then show how FedExP can be motivated as a novel extension to the extrapolation mechanism that is used to speed up POCS. Our theoretical analysis later also discusses the implications of FedExP in underparameterized and non-convex settings. Experimental results show that FedExP consistently converges faster than FedAvg and competing baselines on a range of realistic FL datasets",

In this paper, we study graph compression to reduce the storage requirement for GNN in serving. Given a GNN model to be served, we propose to construct a compressed graph with  a smaller number of nodes. In serving time, one just needs to replace the original training set graph by this compressed graph, without the need of changing the actual GNN model and the forward pass. We carefully analyze the error in the forward pass and derive simple ways to construct the compressed graph to minimize the approximation error.

    "abstract": "While Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated their efficacy in dealing with non-Euclidean structural data, they are difficult to be deployed in real applications due to the scalability constraint imposed by the multi-hop data dependency. Existing methods attempt to address this scalability issue by training student multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) exclusively on node content features using labels derived from the teacher GNNs. However, the trained MLPs are neither effective nor robust. In this paper, we ascribe the lack of effectiveness and robustness to three significant challenges: 1) the misalignment between content feature and label spaces, 2) the strict hard matching to teacher's output, and 3) the sensitivity to node feature noises. To address the challenges, we propose NOSMOG, a novel method to learn NOise-robust Structure-aware MLPs On Graphs, with remarkable effectiveness, robustness, and efficiency. Specifically, we first address the misalignment by complementing node content with position features to capture the graph structural information. We then design an innovative representational similarity distillation strategy to inject soft node similarities into MLPs. Finally, we introduce adversarial feature augmentation to ensure stable learning against feature noises. Extensive experiments and theoretical analyses demonstrate the superiority of NOSMOG by comparing it to GNNs and the state-of-the-art method in both transductive and inductive settings across seven datasets.

Using this analysis, we generalize the existing results of maximum-margin bias for homogeneous networks to this richer class of models. We find that gradient flow implicitly favors a subset of the parameters, unlike in the case of a homogeneous model where all parameters are treated equally. We demonstrate through simple examples how this strong favoritism toward minimizing an asymmetric norm can degrade the robustness of quasi-homogeneous models. On the other hand, we conjecture that this norm-minimization discards, when possible, unnecessary higher-order parameters, reducing the model to a sparser parameterization.

However, using RL for LM-based generation faces empirical challenges, including training instability due to the combinatorial action space, as well as a lack of open-source libraries and benchmarks customized for LM alignment. Thus, a question rises in the research community: is RL a practical paradigm for NLP?\n\nTo help answer this, we first introduce an open-source modular library, \nR\nL\n4\nL\nM\ns\n (Reinforcement Learning for Language Models), for optimizing language generators with RL. The library consists of on-policy RL algorithms that can be used to train any encoder or encoder-decoder LM in the HuggingFace library (Wolf et al. 2020) with an arbitrary reward function.

To study this, we incorporate diffusion methods into a multi-scale decomposition, reducing dimensionality by assuming a stationary local Markov model for wavelet coefficients conditioned on coarser-scale coefficients. We instantiate this model using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with local receptive fields, which enforce both the stationarity and Markov properties. Global structures are captured using a CNN with receptive fields covering the entire (but small) low-pass image. We test this model on a dataset of face images, which are highly non-stationary and contain large-scale geometric structures.\nRemarkably, denoising, super-resolution, and image synthesis results all demonstrate that these structures can be captured with significantly smaller conditioning neighborhoods than required by a Markov model implemented in the pixel domain. Our results show that score estimation for large complex images can be reduced to low-dimensional Markov conditional models across scales,  alleviating the curse of dimensionality",

We demonstrate these constraints lead to disentanglement in a variety of tasks and architectures, including variational autoencoders. We also use this theory to explain why the brain partitions its cells into distinct cell types such as grid and object-vector cells, and also explain when the brain instead entangles representations in response to entangled task factors.

    "abstract": "Simulating rigid collisions among arbitrary shapes is notoriously difficult due to complex geometry and the strong non-linearity of the interactions. While graph neural network (GNN)-based models are effective at learning to simulate complex physical dynamics, such as fluids, cloth and articulated bodies, they have been less effective and efficient on rigid-body physics, except with very simple shapes. Existing methods that model collisions through the meshes' nodes are often inaccurate because they struggle when collisions occur on faces far from nodes. Alternative approaches that represent the geometry densely with many particles are prohibitively expensive for complex shapes. Here we introduce the ``Face Interaction Graph Network'' (FIGNet) which extends beyond GNN-based methods, and computes interactions between mesh faces, rather than nodes. Compared to learned node- and particle-based methods, FIGNet is around 4x more accurate in simulating complex shape interactions, while also 8x more computationally efficient on sparse, rigid meshes. Moreover, FIGNet can learn frictional dynamics directly from real-world data, and can be more accurate than analytical solvers given modest amounts of training data. FIGNet represents a key step forward in one of the few remaining physical domains which have seen little competition from learned simulators, and offers allied fields such as robotics, graphics and mechanical design a new tool for simulation and model-based planning",

    "abstract": "We show that the representation cost of fully connected neural networks with homogeneous nonlinearities - which describes the implicit bias in function space of networks with \nL\n2\n-regularization or with losses such as the cross-entropy - converges as the depth of the network goes to infinity to a notion of rank over nonlinear functions. We then inquire under which conditions the global minima of the loss recover the `true' rank of the data: we show that for too large depths the global minimum will be approximately rank 1 (underestimating the rank); we then argue that there is a range of depths which grows with the number of datapoints where the true rank is recovered. Finally, we discuss the effect of the rank of a classifier on the topology of the resulting class boundaries and show that autoencoders with optimal nonlinear rank are naturally denoising",

For tasks like question answering, it is essential to know when we can trust the natural language outputs of foundation models. We show that measuring uncertainty in natural language is challenging because of \"semantic equivalence\"—different sentences can mean the same thing. To overcome these challenges we introduce semantic entropy—an entropy which incorporates linguistic invariances created by shared meanings. Our method is unsupervised, uses only a single model, and requires no modifications to off-the-shelf language models. In comprehensive ablation studies we show that the semantic entropy is more predictive of model accuracy on question answering data sets than comparable baselines",

    "abstract": "Self-distillation methods using Siamese networks are popular for self-supervised pre-training. DINO is one such method based on a cross-entropy loss between \nK\n-dimensional probability vectors, obtained by applying a softmax function to the dot product between representations and learnt prototypes. Given the fact that the learned representations are \nL\n2\n-normalized, we show that DINO and its derivatives, such as iBOT, can be interpreted as a mixture model of von Mises-Fisher components. With this interpretation, DINO assumes equal precision for all components when the prototypes are also \nL\n2\n-normalized. Using this insight we propose DINO-vMF, that adds appropriate normalization constants when computing the cluster assignment probabilities. Unlike DINO, DINO-vMF is stable also for the larger ViT-Base model with unnormalized prototypes. We show that the added flexibility of the mixture model is beneficial in terms of better image representations. The DINO-vMF pre-trained model consistently performs better than DINO on a range of downstream tasks. We obtain similar improvements for iBOT-vMF vs iBOT and thereby show the relevance of our proposed modification also for other methods derived from DINO",

    "title": "SMART: Self-supervised Multi-task pretrAining with contRol Transformers",
    "abstract": "Self-supervised pretraining has been extensively studied in language and vision domains, where a unified model can be easily adapted to various downstream tasks by pretraining representations without explicit labels. When it comes to sequential decision-making tasks, however, it is difficult to properly design such a pretraining approach that can cope with both high-dimensional perceptual information and the complexity of sequential control over long interaction horizons. The challenge becomes combinatorially more complex if we want to pretrain representations amenable to a large variety of tasks. To tackle this problem, in this work, we formulate a general pretraining-finetuning pipeline for sequential decision making, under which we propose a generic pretraining framework \\textit{Self-supervised Multi-task pretrAining with contRol Transformer (SMART)}. By systematically investigating pretraining regimes, we carefully design a Control Transformer (CT) coupled with a novel control-centric pretraining objective in a self-supervised manner. SMART encourages the representation to capture the common essential information relevant to short-term control and long-term control, which is transferrable across tasks. We show by extensive experiments in DeepMind Control Suite that SMART significantly improves the learning efficiency among seen and unseen downstream tasks and domains under different learning scenarios including Imitation Learning (IL) and Reinforcement Learning (RL). Benefiting from the proposed control-centric objective, SMART is resilient to distribution shift between pretraining and finetuning, and even works well with low-quality pretraining datasets that are randomly collected.

Hence, training DNNs to be certifiably robust to these perturbations is critical. However, no prior work has been able to incorporate the objective of deterministic certified robustness against geometric transformations into the training procedure, as existing verifiers are exceedingly slow. To address these challenges, we propose the first provable defense for deterministic certified geometric robustness. Our framework leverages a novel GPU-optimized verifier that can certify images between 60\n×\n to 42,600\n×\n faster than existing geometric robustness verifiers, and thus unlike existing works, is fast enough for use in training. Across multiple datasets, our results show that networks trained via our framework consistently achieve state-of-the-art deterministic certified geometric robustness and clean accuracy. Furthermore, for the first time, we verify the geometric robustness of a neural network for the challenging, real-world setting of autonomous driving",

These applications typically assume that the domain symmetry is fully described by explicit transformations of the model inputs and outputs. However, many real-life applications contain only latent or partial symmetries which cannot be easily described by simple transformations of the input. In these cases, it is necessary to learn symmetry in the environment instead of imposing it mathematically on the network architecture. We discover, surprisingly, that imposing equivariance constraints that do not exactly match the domain symmetry is very helpful in learning the true symmetry in the environment. We differentiate between extrinsic and incorrect symmetry constraints and show that while imposing incorrect symmetry can impede the model's performance, imposing extrinsic symmetry can actually improve performance. We demonstrate that an equivariant model can significantly outperform non-equivariant methods on domains with latent symmetries both in supervised learning and in reinforcement learning for robotic manipulation and control problems",

    "abstract": "Recent approximations to backpropagation (BP) have mitigated many of BP's computational inefficiencies and incompatibilities with biology, but important limitations still remain. Moreover, the approximations significantly decrease accuracy in benchmarks, suggesting that an entirely different approach may be more fruitful. Here, grounded on recent theory for Hebbian learning in soft winner-take-all networks, we present multilayer SoftHebb, i.e. an algorithm that trains deep neural networks, without any feedback, target, or error signals. As a result, it achieves efficiency by avoiding weight transport, non-local plasticity, time-locking of layer updates, iterative equilibria, and (self-) supervisory or other feedback signals – which were necessary in other approaches. Its increased efficiency and biological compatibility do not trade off accuracy compared to state-of-the-art bio-plausible learning, but rather improve it. With up to five hidden layers and an added linear classifier, accuracies on MNIST, CIFAR-10, STL-10, and ImageNet, respectively reach 99.4%, 80.3%, 76.2%, and 27.3%. In conclusion, SoftHebb shows with a radically different approach from BP that Deep Learning over few layers may be plausible in the brain and increases the accuracy of bio-plausible machine learning.

Existing methods for dealing with these challenges tend to make strong assumptions about the particular issues at play, and often require a priori knowledge or metadata such as domain labels. Our work is orthogonal to these methods: we instead focus on providing a unified and efficient framework for Metadata Archaeology -- uncovering and inferring metadata of examples in a dataset. We curate different subsets of data that might exist in a dataset (e.g. mislabeled, atypical, or out-of-distribution examples) using simple transformations, and leverage differences in learning dynamics between these probe suites to infer metadata of interest. Our method is on par with far more sophisticated mitigation methods across different tasks: identifying and correcting mislabeled examples, classifying minority-group samples, prioritizing points relevant for training and enabling scalable human auditing of relevant examples",

    "abstract": "Deep learning vision systems are widely deployed across applications where reliability is critical. However, even today's best models can fail to recognize an object when its pose, lighting, or background varies. While existing benchmarks surface examples challenging for models, they do not explain why such mistakes arise. To address this need, we introduce ImageNet-X—a set of sixteen human annotations of factors such as pose, background, or lighting the entire ImageNet-1k validation set as well as a random subset of 12k training images. Equipped with ImageNet-X, we investigate 2,200 current recognition models and study the types of mistakes as a function of model’s (1) architecture, e.g. transformer vs. convolutional, (2) learning paradigm, e.g. supervised vs. self-supervised, and (3) training procedures, e.g., data augmentation. Regardless of these choices, we find models have consistent failure modes across ImageNet-X categories. We also find that while data augmentation can improve robustness to certain factors, they induce spill-over effects to other factors. For example, color-jitter augmentation improves robustness to color and brightness, but surprisingly hurts robustness to pose. Together, these insights suggest to advance the robustness of modern vision models, future research should focus on collecting additional data and understanding data augmentation schemes. Along with these insights, we release a toolkit based on ImageNet-X to spur further study into the mistakes image recognition systems make",

We present Choreographer, a model-based agent that exploits its world model to learn and adapt skills in imagination. Our method decouples the exploration and skill learning processes, being able to discover skills in the latent state space of the model. During adaptation, the agent uses a meta-controller to evaluate and adapt the learned skills efficiently by deploying them in parallel in imagination. Choreographer is able to learn skills both from offline data, and by collecting data simultaneously with an exploration policy. The skills can be used to effectively adapt to downstream tasks, as we show in the URL benchmark, where we outperform previous approaches from both pixels and states inputs. The skills also explore the environment thoroughly, finding sparse rewards more frequently, as shown in goal-reaching tasks from the DMC Suite and Meta-World. \nProject website: https://skillchoreographer.github.io/",

Nevertheless, the exact properties of fair graph data may vary significantly in different scenarios. Hence, heuristically designed augmentations may not always generate fair graph data in different application scenarios. In this work, we propose a method, known as Graphair, to learn fair representations based on automated graph data augmentations. Such fairness-aware augmentations are themselves learned from data. Our Graphair is designed to automatically discover fairness-aware augmentations from input graphs in order to circumvent sensitive information while preserving other useful information. Experimental results demonstrate that our Graphair consistently outperforms many baselines on multiple node classification datasets in terms of fairness-accuracy trade-off performance. In addition, results indicate that Graphair can automatically learn to generate fair graph data without prior knowledge on fairness-relevant graph properties",

    "abstract": "We propose a novel algorithm for offline reinforcement learning called Value Iteration with Perturbed Rewards (VIPeR), which amalgamates the pessimism principle with random perturbations of the value function. Most current offline RL algorithms explicitly construct statistical confidence regions to obtain pessimism via lower confidence bounds (LCB), which cannot easily scale to complex problems where a neural network is used to estimate the value functions. Instead, VIPeR implicitly obtains pessimism by simply perturbing the offline data multiple times with carefully-designed i.i.d. Gaussian noises to learn an ensemble of estimated state-action {value functions} and acting greedily with respect to the minimum of the ensemble. The estimated state-action values are obtained by fitting a parametric model (e.g., neural networks) to the perturbed datasets using gradient descent. As a result, VIPeR only needs \nO\n(\n1\n)\n time complexity for action selection, while LCB-based algorithms require at least \nΩ\n(\nK\n2\n)\n, where \nK\n is the total number of trajectories in the offline data. We also propose a novel data-splitting technique that helps remove a factor involving the log of the covering number in our bound. We prove that VIPeR yields a provable uncertainty quantifier with overparameterized neural networks and enjoys a bound on sub-optimality of \nO\n~\n(\nκ\nH\n5\n/\n2\nd\n~\n/\nK\n)\n, where \nd\n~\n is the effective dimension, \nH\n is the horizon length and \nκ\n measures the distributional shift. We corroborate the statistical and computational efficiency of VIPeR with an empirical evaluation on a wide set of synthetic and real-world datasets. To the best of our knowledge, VIPeR is the first algorithm for offline RL that is provably efficient for general Markov decision processes (MDPs) with neural network function approximation",

Besides being fully competitive with the state of the art, our method significantly reduces time and memory complexity for self-supervised training, making it implementable for very large embedding dimensions on existing devices and more easily adjustable than previous methods to settings with limited resources. Our work follows the major paradigm where the model learns to be invariant to some predefined image transformations (cropping, blurring, color jittering, etc.), while avoiding a degenerate solution by regularizing the embedding distribution. Our particular contribution is to propose a loss family promoting the embedding distribution to be close to the uniform distribution on the hypersphere, with respect to the maximum mean discrepancy pseudometric. We demonstrate that this family encompasses several regularizers of former methods, including uniformity-based and information-maximization methods, which are variants of our flexible regularization loss with different kernels.

In this work, we seek to develop machine learning analogs of this process, in which we jointly learn the morphology of complex nonlinear elastic solids along with a deep neural network to control it. By using a specialized differentiable simulator of elastic mechanics coupled to conventional deep learning architectures---which we refer to as neuromechanical autoencoders---we are able to learn to perform morphological computation via gradient descent. Key to our approach is the use of mechanical metamaterials---cellular solids, in particular---as the morphological substrate. Just as deep neural networks provide flexible and massively-parametric function approximators for perceptual and control tasks, cellular solid metamaterials are promising as a rich and learnable space for approximating a variety of actuation tasks. In this work we take advantage of these complementary computational concepts to co-design materials and neural network controls to achieve nonintuitive mechanical behavior.

    "abstract": "Reward and representation learning are two long-standing challenges for learning an expanding set of robot manipulation skills from sensory observations. Given the inherent cost and scarcity of in-domain, task-specific robot data, learning from large, diverse, offline human videos has emerged as a promising path towards acquiring a generally useful visual representation for control; however, how these human videos can be used for general-purpose reward learning remains an open question. We introduce \nV\nalue-\nI\nmplicit \nP\nre-training (VIP), a self-supervised pre-trained visual representation capable of generating dense and smooth reward functions for unseen robotic tasks. VIP casts representation learning from human videos as an offline goal-conditioned reinforcement learning problem and derives a self-supervised dual goal-conditioned value-function objective that does not depend on actions, enabling pre-training on unlabeled human videos. Theoretically, VIP can be understood as a novel implicit time contrastive objective that generates a temporally smooth embedding, enabling the value function to be implicitly defined via the embedding distance, which can then be used to construct the reward for any goal-image specified downstream task. Trained on large-scale Ego4D human videos and without any fine-tuning on in-domain, task-specific data, VIP can provide dense visual reward for an extensive set of simulated and \nreal-robot\n tasks, enabling diverse reward-based visual control methods and significantly outperforming all prior pre-trained representations.

    "title": "Subquadratic Algorithms for Kernel Matrices via Kernel Density Estimation",
    "abstract": "Kernel matrices, as well as weighted graphs represented by them, are ubiquitous objects in machine learning, statistics and other related fields. The main drawback of using kernel methods (learning and inference using kernel matrices) is efficiency -- given \nn\n input points, most kernel-based algorithms need to materialize the full \nn\n×\nn\n kernel matrix before performing any subsequent computation, thus incurring \nΩ\n(\nn\n2\n)\n runtime. Breaking this quadratic barrier for various problems has therefore, been a subject of extensive research efforts. \n\nWe break the quadratic barrier and obtain \\emph{subquadratic} time  algorithms for several fundamental linear-algebraic and graph processing primitives, including approximating the top eigenvalue and eigenvector, spectral sparsification, solving linear systems, local clustering, low-rank approximation, arboricity estimation and counting weighted triangles. We build on the recently developed Kernel Density Estimation framework, which (after preprocessing in time subquadratic in \nn\n) can return estimates of row/column sums of the kernel matrix. In particular, we develop efficient reductions from \\emph{weighted vertex} and \\emph{weighted edge sampling} on kernel graphs, \\emph{simulating random walks} on kernel graphs, and \\emph{importance sampling} on matrices to Kernel Density Estimation and show that we can generate samples from these distributions in \\emph{sublinear} (in the support of the distribution) time. Our reductions are the central ingredient in each of our applications and we believe they may be of independent interest. We empirically demonstrate the efficacy of our algorithms on low-rank approximation (LRA) and spectral sparsification, where we observe a \n9x\n decrease in the number of kernel evaluations over baselines for LRA and a \n41x\n reduction in the graph size for spectral sparsification",

By co-training a neural network on clean and adversarial inputs, it is possible to improve classification accuracy on the clean, non-adversarial inputs. We demonstrate that, contrary to previous findings, it is not necessary to separate batch statistics when co-training on clean and adversarial inputs, and that it is sufficient to use adapters with few domain-specific parameters for each type of input. We establish that using the classification token of a Vision Transformer (ViT) as an adapter is enough to match the classification performance of dual normalization layers, while using significantly less additional parameters. First, we improve upon the top-1 accuracy of a non-adversarially trained ViT-B16 model by +1.12% on ImageNet (reaching 83.76% top-1 accuracy). Second, and more importantly, we show that training with adapters enables model soups through linear combinations of the clean and adversarial tokens. These model soups, which we call adversarial model soups, allow us to trade-off between clean and robust accuracy without sacrificing efficiency. Finally, we show that we can easily adapt the resulting models in the face of distribution shifts. Our ViT-B16 obtains top-1 accuracies on ImageNet variants that are on average +4.00% better than those obtained with Masked Autoencoders",

    "abstract": "The backdoor attack, where the adversary uses inputs stamped with triggers (e.g., a patch) to activate pre-planted malicious behaviors, is a severe threat to Deep Neural Network (DNN) models. Trigger inversion is an effective way of identifying backdoor models and understanding embedded adversarial behaviors. A challenge of trigger inversion is that there are many ways of constructing the trigger. Existing methods cannot generalize to various types of triggers by making certain assumptions or attack-specific constraints. The fundamental reason is that existing work does not formally define the trigger and the inversion problem. This work formally defines and analyzes the trigger and the inversion problem. Then, it proposes a unified framework to invert backdoor triggers based on the formalization of triggers and the identified inner behaviors of backdoor models from our analysis. Our prototype UNICORN is general and effective in inverting backdoor triggers in DNNs. The code can be found at https://github.com/RU-System-Software-and-Security/UNICORN",

    "abstract": "Models for image segmentation, node classification and many other tasks map a single input to multiple labels. By perturbing this single shared input (e.g. the image) an adversary can manipulate several predictions (e.g. misclassify several pixels). Collective robustness certification is the task of provably bounding the number of robust predictions under this threat model. The only dedicated method that goes beyond certifying each output independently is limited to strictly local models, where each prediction is associated with a small receptive field. We propose a more general collective robustness certificate for all types of models. We further show that this approach is beneficial for the larger class of softly local models, where each output is dependent on the entire input but assigns different levels of importance to different input regions (e.g. based on their proximity in the image). The certificate is based on our novel localized randomized smoothing approach, where the random perturbation strength for different input regions is proportional to their importance for the outputs. Localized smoothing Pareto-dominates existing certificates on both image segmentation and node classification tasks, simultaneously offering higher accuracy and stronger certificates",

We propose the {\\em model-based causal Bayesian optimization algorithm (MCBO)} that learns a full system model instead of only modeling intervention-reward pairs. MCBO propagates epistemic uncertainty about the causal mechanisms through the graph and trades off exploration and exploitation via the optimism principle.

    "title": "Training language models to summarize narratives improves brain alignment",
    "abstract": "Building systems that achieve a deeper understanding of language is one of the central goals of natural language processing (NLP). Towards this goal, recent works have begun to train language models on narrative datasets which require extracting the most critical information by integrating across long contexts. However, it is still an open question whether these models are learning a deeper understanding of the text, or if the models are simply learning a heuristic to complete the task. This work investigates this further by turning to the one language processing system that truly understands complex language: the human brain. We show that training language models for deeper narrative understanding results in richer representations that have improved alignment to human brain activity. We further find that the improvements in brain alignment are larger for character names than for other discourse features, which indicates that these models are learning important narrative elements. Taken together, these results suggest that this type of training can indeed lead to deeper language understanding. These findings have consequences both for cognitive neuroscience by revealing some of the significant factors behind brain-NLP alignment, and for NLP by highlighting that understanding of long-range context can be improved beyond language modeling",

Using our framework, we derive popular attention layers used in practice and propose two new attentions: 1) the Batch Normalized Attention (Attention-BN) derived from the batch normalization layer and 2)  the Attention with Scaled Head (Attention-SH) derived from using less training data to fit the SVR model.

    "abstract": "Incorporating second-order gradient information (curvature) into optimization can dramatically reduce the number of iterations required to train machine learning models. In natural gradient descent, such information comes from the Fisher information matrix which yields a number of desirable properties. As exact natural gradient updates are intractable for large models, successful methods such as KFAC and sequels approximate the Fisher in a structured form that can easily be inverted. However, this requires model/layer-specific tensor algebra and certain approximations that are often difficult to justify. Here, we use ideas from Legendre-Fenchel duality to learn a direct and efficiently evaluated model for the product of the inverse Fisher with any vector, in an online manner, leading to natural gradient steps that get progressively more accurate over time despite noisy gradients. We prove that the resulting “Fisher-Legendre” (FishLeg) optimizer converges to a (global) minimum of non-convex functions satisfying the PL condition, which applies in particular to deep linear networks. On standard auto-encoder benchmarks, we show empirically that FishLeg outperforms standard first-order optimization methods, and performs on par with or better than other second-order methods, especially when using small batches.

    "title": "Capturing the Motion of Every Joint: 3D Human Pose and Shape Estimation with Independent Tokens",
    "abstract": "In this paper we present a novel method to estimate 3D human pose and shape from monocular videos. This task requires directly recovering pixel-alignment 3D human pose and body shape from monocular images or videos, which is challenging due to its inherent ambiguity. To improve precision, existing methods highly rely on the initialized mean pose and shape as prior estimates and parameter regression with an iterative error feedback manner. In addition, video-based approaches model the overall change over the image-level features to temporally enhance the single-frame feature, but fail to capture the rotational motion at the joint level, and cannot guarantee local temporal consistency. To address these issues, we propose a novel Transformer-based model with a design of independent tokens. First, we introduce three types of tokens independent of the image feature: \\textit{joint rotation tokens, shape token, and camera token}. \nBy progressively interacting with image features through Transformer layers, these tokens learn to encode the prior knowledge of human 3D joint rotations, body shape, and position information from large-scale data, and are updated to estimate SMPL parameters conditioned on a given image. Second, benefiting from the proposed token-based representation, we further use a temporal model to focus on capturing the rotational temporal information of each joint, which is empirically conducive to preventing large jitters in local parts. Despite being conceptually simple, the proposed method attains superior performances on the 3DPW and Human3.6M datasets. Using ResNet-50 and Transformer architectures, it obtains 42.0 mm error on the PA-MPJPE metric of the challenging 3DPW, outperforming state-of-the-art counterparts by a large margin.

The idea of rectified flow is to learn the ODE to follow the straight paths connecting the points drawn from \nπ\n0\n and \nπ\n1\n as much as possible. This is  achieved by solving a straightforward nonlinear least squares optimization problem, which can be easily scaled to large models without introducing extra parameters beyond standard supervised learning. The straight paths are the shortest paths between two points, and can be simulated exactly without time discretization and hence yield computationally efficient models. We show that, by learning a rectified flow from data, we effectively turn an arbitrary coupling of \nπ\n0\n and \nπ\n1\n to a  new deterministic coupling with provably non-increasing convex transport costs. In addition, with a ``reflow\" procedure that iteratively learns a new rectified flow from the data bootstrapped from the previous one, we obtain a sequence of flows with increasingly straight paths, which can be simulated accurately with coarse time discretization in the inference phase. In empirical studies, we show that rectified flow performs superbly on image generation, image-to-image translation, and domain adaptation. In particular, on image generation and translation, our method yields nearly straight flows that give high quality results even with \\emph{a single Euler discretization step}.

Inspired by the efficacy of the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) method in the single-objective context, we generalize ADMM to derive a first-order method for cVIs, that we refer to as ADMM-based interior-point method for constrained VIs (ACVI). We provide convergence guarantees for ACVI in two general classes of problems: (i) when the operator is \nξ\n-monotone, and (ii) when it is monotone, some constraints are active and the game is not purely rotational. When the operator is in addition L-Lipschitz for the latter case, we match known lower bounds on rates for the gap function of \nO\n(\n1\n/\nK\n)\n and \nO\n(\n1\n/\nK\n)\n for the last and average iterate, respectively. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first presentation of a first-order interior-point method for the general cVI problem that has a global convergence guarantee. Moreover, unlike previous work in this setting, ACVI provides a means to solve cVIs when the constraints are nontrivial. Empirical analyses demonstrate clear advantages of ACVI over common first-order methods. In particular, (i) cyclical behavior is notably reduced as our methods approach the solution from the analytic center, and (ii) unlike projection-based methods that zigzag when near a constraint, ACVI efficiently handles the constraints",

Quantum neural networks (QNNs), which exert the power of modern quantum machines, have emerged as a leading protocol to conquer this issue. As such, the performance enhancement of QNNs becomes the core in GSP. Empirical evidence showed that QNNs with handcraft symmetric ans\\\"atze generally experience better trainability than those with asymmetric ans\\\"atze, while theoretical explanations remain vague. To fill this knowledge gap, here we propose the effective quantum neural tangent kernel (EQNTK) and connect this concept with over-parameterization theory to quantify the convergence of QNNs towards the global optima. We uncover that the advance of symmetric ans\\\"atze attributes to their large EQNTK value with low effective dimension, which requests few parameters and quantum circuit depth to reach the over-parameterization regime permitting a benign loss landscape and fast convergence. Guided by EQNTK, we further devise a symmetric pruning (SP) scheme to automatically tailor a symmetric ansatz from an over-parameterized and asymmetric one to greatly improve the performance of QNNs when the explicit symmetry information of Hamiltonian is unavailable.

In this paper, we develop a novel semi-parametric language model architecture, Knowledge-in-Context (KiC), which empowers a parametric text-to-text language model with a knowledge-rich external memory. Specifically, the external memory contains six different types of knowledge:  entity,  dictionary, commonsense, event, script, and causality knowledge. For each input instance, the KiC model adaptively selects a knowledge type and retrieves the most helpful pieces of knowledge. The input instance along with its knowledge augmentation is fed into a text-to-text model (e.g., T5) to generate the output answer, where both the input and the output are in natural language forms after prompting. Interestingly, we find that KiC can be identified as a special mixture-of-experts (MoE) model, where the knowledge selector plays the role of a router that is used to determine the sequence-to-expert assignment in MoE. This key observation inspires us to develop a novel algorithm for training KiC with an instance-adaptive knowledge selector. As a knowledge-rich semi-parametric language model, KiC only needs a much smaller parametric part to achieve superior zero-shot performance on unseen tasks. By evaluating on 40+ different tasks, we show that KiC-Large with 770M parameters easily outperforms large language models that are 4-39x larger. In addition, KiC also exhibits emergent abilities at a much smaller model scale compared to the fully-parametric models",

    "title": "Mosaic Representation Learning for Self-supervised Visual Pre-training",
    "abstract": "Self-supervised learning has achieved significant success in learning visual representations without the need for manual annotation. To obtain generalizable representations, a meticulously designed data augmentation strategy is one of the most crucial parts. Recently, multi-crop strategies utilizing a set of small crops as positive samples have been shown to learn spatially structured features. However, it overlooks the diverse contextual backgrounds, which reduces the variance of the input views and degenerates the performance. To address this problem, we propose a mosaic representation learning framework (MosRep), consisting of a new data augmentation strategy that enriches the backgrounds of each small crop and improves the quality of visual representations. Specifically, we randomly sample numbers of small crops from different input images and compose them into a mosaic view, which is equivalent to introducing different background information for each small crop. Additionally, we further jitter the mosaic view to prevent memorizing the spatial locations of each crop. Along with optimization, our MosRep gradually extracts more discriminative features. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our method improves the performance far greater than the multi-crop strategy on a series of downstream tasks, e.g., +7.4% and +4.9% than the multi-crop strategy on ImageNet-1K with 1% label and 10% label, respectively.

    "title": "FluidLab: A Differentiable Environment for Benchmarking Complex Fluid Manipulation",
    "abstract": "Humans manipulate various kinds of fluids in their everyday life: creating latte art, scooping floating objects from water, rolling an ice cream cone, etc. Using robots to augment or replace human labors in these daily settings remain as a challenging task due to the multifaceted complexities of fluids. Previous research in robotic fluid manipulation mostly consider fluids governed by an ideal, Newtonian model in simple task settings (e.g., pouring water into a container). However, the vast majority of real-world fluid systems manifest their complexities in terms of the fluid’s complex material behaviors (e.g., elastoplastic deformation) and multi-component interactions (e.g. coffee and frothed milk when making latte art), both of which were well beyond the scope of the current literature. To evaluate robot learning algorithms on understanding and interacting with such complex fluid systems, a comprehensive virtual platform with versatile simulation capabilities and well-established tasks is needed. In this work, we introduce FluidLab, a simulation environment with a diverse set of manipulation tasks involving complex fluid dynamics. These tasks address interactions between solid and fluid as well as among multiple fluids. At the heart of our platform is a fully differentiable physics simulator, FluidEngine, providing GPU-accelerated simulations and gradient calculations for various material types and their couplings, extending the scope of the existing differentiable simulation engines. We identify several challenges for fluid manipulation learning by evaluating a set of reinforcement learning and trajectory optimization methods on our platform. To address these challenges, we propose several domain-specific optimization schemes coupled with differentiable physics, which are empirically shown to be effective in tackling optimization problems featured by fluid system’s non-convex and non-smooth properties. Furthermore, we demonstrate reasonable sim-to-real transfer by deploying optimized trajectories in real-world settings. FluidLab is publicly available at: https://fluidlab2023.github.io",

Specifically, we present the notion of Flow Matching (FM), a simulation-free approach for training CNFs based on regressing vector fields of fixed conditional probability paths. Flow Matching is compatible with a general family of Gaussian probability paths for transforming between noise and data samples---which subsumes existing diffusion paths as specific instances. Interestingly, we find that employing FM with diffusion paths results in a more robust and stable alternative for training diffusion models. Furthermore, Flow Matching opens the door to training CNFs with other, non-diffusion probability paths. An instance of particular interest is using Optimal Transport (OT) displacement interpolation to define the conditional probability paths. These paths are more efficient than diffusion paths, provide faster training and sampling, and result in better generalization. Training CNFs using Flow Matching on ImageNet leads to consistently better performance than alternative diffusion-based methods in terms of both likelihood and sample quality, and allows fast and reliable sample generation using off-the-shelf numerical ODE solvers",

However, few attempts have been made to understand the inherent data property of sequence data, neglecting the critical factor that may significantly affect the performance of sequence modeling. In this paper, we theoretically and empirically analyze a generic property of sequence data, i.e., continuity, and connect this property with the performance of deep models. First, we empirically observe that different kinds of models for sequence modeling prefer data with different continuity. Then, we theoretically analyze the continuity preference of different models in both time and frequency domains. To further utilize continuity to improve sequence modeling, we propose a simple yet effective Lipschitz Regularizer, that can flexibly adjust data continuity according to model preferences, and bring very little extra computational cost. Extensive experiments on various tasks demonstrate that altering data continuity via Lipschitz Regularizer can largely improve the performance of many deep models for sequence modeling",

    "abstract": "The ability to interpret machine learning models is critical for high-stakes applications. Due to its desirable theoretical properties, path integration is a widely used scheme for feature attribution to interpret model predictions. However, the methods implementing this scheme currently rely on absolute attribution scores to eventually provide sensible interpretations. This not only contradicts the premise that the features with larger attribution scores are more relevant to the model prediction, but also conflicts with the theoretical settings for which the desirable properties of the attributions are proven. We address this by devising a method to first compute an appropriate reference for the path integration scheme. This reference further helps in identifying valid interpolation points on a desired integration path. The reference is computed in a gradient ascending direction on the model's loss surface, while the interpolations are performed by analyzing the model gradients and variations between the reference and the input. The eventual integration is effectively performed along a non-linear path. Our scheme can be incorporated into the existing integral-based attribution methods. We also devise an effective sampling and integration procedure that enables employing our scheme with multi-reference path integration efficiently. We achieve a marked performance boost for a range of integral-based attribution methods on both local and global evaluation metrics by enhancing them with our scheme. Our extensive results also show improved sensitivity, sanity preservation and model robustness with the proposed re-calibration of the attribution techniques with our method",

    "abstract": "Offline reinforcement learning (RL), which aims at learning good policies from historical data, has received significant attention over the past years. Much effort has focused on improving offline RL practicality by addressing the prevalent issue of partial data coverage through various forms of conservative policy learning. While the majority of algorithms do not have finite-\nsample guarantees, several provable conservative offline RL algorithms are designed and analyzed within the single-policy concentrability framework that handles partial coverage. Yet, in the nonlinear function approximation setting where confidence intervals are difficult to obtain, existing provable algorithms suffer from computational intractability, prohibitively strong assumptions, and suboptimal statistical rates. In this paper, we leverage the marginalized importance sampling (MIS) formulation of RL and present the first set of offline RL algorithms that are statistically optimal and practical under general function approximation and single-policy concentrability, bypassing the need for uncertainty quantification. We identify that the key to successfully solving the sample-based approximation of the MIS problem is ensuring that certain occupancy validity constraints are nearly satisfied. We enforce these constraints by a novel application of the augmented Lagrangian method and prove the following result: with the MIS formulation, augmented Lagrangian is enough for statistically optimal offline RL. In stark contrast to prior algorithms that induce additional conservatism through methods such as behavior regularization, our approach provably eliminates this need and reinterprets regularizers as \"enforcers of occupancy validity\" than \"promoters of conservatism",

This makes it impossible for models of code\nto keep current with all available APIs by simply training these models on existing code repositories. Thus, existing models inherently cannot generalize to using unseen functions and libraries, because these would never appear in the training data. In contrast, when human programmers use functions and libraries for the first time, they frequently refer to textual resources such as code manuals and documentation, to explore and understand the available functionality. Inspired by this observation, we introduce DocPrompting: a natural-language-to-code generation approach that explicitly leverages documentation by (1) retrieving the relevant documentation pieces given an NL intent, and (2) generating code based on the NL intent and the retrieved documentation. DocPrompting is general: it can be applied to any programming language and is agnostic to the underlying neural model. We demonstrate that DocPrompting consistently improves NL-to-code models: DocPrompting improves strong base models such as CodeT5 by 2.85% in pass@1 (52% relative gain) and 4.39% in pass@10 (30% relative gain) in execution-based evaluation on the popular Python CoNaLa benchmark; on a new Bash dataset tldr, DocPrompting improves CodeT5 and GPT-Neo1.3B by up to absolute 6.9% exact match",

In order to align input-output (IO) interface among multiple tasks and diverse agent morphologies while preserving essential 3D geometric relations, we introduce morphology-task graph, which treats observations, actions and goals/task in a unified graph representation. We also develop MxT-Bench for fast large-scale behavior generation, which supports procedural generation of diverse morphology-task combinations with a minimal blueprint and hardware-accelerated simulator. Through efficient representation and architecture selection on MxT-Bench, we find out that a morphology-task graph representation coupled with Transformer architecture improves the multi-task performances compared to other baselines including recent discrete tokenization, and provides better prior knowledge for zero-shot transfer or sample efficiency in downstream multi-task imitation learning. Our work suggests large diverse offline datasets, unified IO representation, and policy representation and architecture selection through supervised learning form a promising approach for studying and advancing morphology-task generalization",

As a case study, we study small transformers trained on a modular arithmetic tasks with emergent grokking behavior. We fully reverse engineer the algorithm learned by these networks, which uses discrete fourier transforms and trigonometric identities to convert addition to rotation about a circle. After confirming the algorithm via ablation, we then use our understanding of the algorithm to define progress measures that precede the grokking phase transition on this task. We see our result as demonstrating both that it is possible to fully reverse engineer trained networks, and that doing so can be invaluable to understanding their training dynamics",

    "abstract": "Dropped into an unknown environment, what should an agent do to quickly learn about the environment and how to accomplish diverse tasks within it? We address this question within the goal-conditioned reinforcement learning paradigm, by identifying how the agent should set its goals at training time to maximize exploration. We propose \"Planning Exploratory Goals\" (PEG), a method that sets goals for each training episode to directly optimize an intrinsic exploration reward. PEG first chooses goal commands such that the agent's goal-conditioned policy, at its current level of training, will end up in states with high exploration potential. It then launches an exploration policy starting at those promising states. To enable this direct optimization, PEG learns world models and adapts sampling-based planning algorithms to \"plan goal commands\". In challenging simulated robotics environments including a multi-legged ant robot in a maze, and a robot arm on a cluttered tabletop, PEG exploration enables more efficient and effective training of goal-conditioned policies relative to baselines and ablations. Our ant successfully navigates a long maze, and the robot arm successfully builds a stack of three blocks upon command. Website: https://sites.google.com/view/exploratory-goals",

This phenomenon has several important consequences when \nk\n≪\nd\n.

This marks a shift from the reward-centric RL paradigm towards controllable agents that can follow arbitrary instructions in an environment. Current RL agents can solve families of related tasks at best, or require planning anew for each task. Strategies for approximate zero-shot RL have been suggested using successor features (SFs) (Borsa et al., 2018) or forward-backward (FB) representations (Touati & Ollivier, 2021), but testing has been limited. \nAfter clarifying the relationships between these schemes, we introduce improved losses and new SF models, and test the viability of zero-shot RL schemes systematically on tasks from the Unsupervised RL benchmark (Laskin et al., 2021). To disentangle universal representation learning from exploration, we work in an offline setting and repeat the tests on several existing replay buffers.\nSFs appear to suffer from the choice of the elementary state features. SFs with Laplacian eigenfunctions do well, while SFs based on auto-encoders, inverse curiosity, transition models, low-rank transition matrix, contrastive learning, or diversity (APS),  perform unconsistently. In contrast, FB representations jointly learn the elementary and successor features from a single, principled criterion.

Consequently, encoding features that capture the hierarchical relationships between states into the model's latent representations is often conducive to recovering effective policies. In this work, we study a new class of deep RL algorithms that promote encoding such relationships by using hyperbolic space to model latent representations. However, we find that a naive application of existing methodology from the hyperbolic deep learning literature leads to fatal instabilities due to the non-stationarity and variance characterizing common gradient estimators in RL. Hence, we design a new general method that directly addresses such optimization challenges and enables stable end-to-end learning with deep hyperbolic representations. We empirically validate our framework by applying it to popular on-policy and off-policy RL algorithms on the Procgen and Atari 100K benchmarks, attaining near universal performance and generalization benefits. Given its natural fit, we hope this work will inspire future RL research to consider hyperbolic representations as a standard tool",

An open challenge in simulating such systems is their multi-resolution dynamics: a small fraction of the system is extremely dynamic, and requires very fine-grained resolution, while a majority of the system is changing slowly and can be modeled by coarser spatial scales. Typical learning-based surrogate models use a uniform spatial scale, which needs to resolve to the finest required scale and can waste a huge compute to achieve required accuracy. In this work, we introduce Learning controllable Adaptive simulation for Multi-resolution Physics (LAMP) as the first full deep learning-based surrogate model that jointly learns the evolution model and optimizes appropriate spatial resolutions that devote more compute to the highly dynamic regions. LAMP consists of a Graph Neural Network (GNN) for learning the forward evolution, and a GNN-based actor-critic for learning the policy of spatial refinement and coarsening. We introduce learning techniques that optimizes LAMP with weighted sum of error and computational cost as objective, allowing LAMP to adapt to varying relative importance of error vs. computation tradeoff at inference time. We evaluate our method in a 1D benchmark of nonlinear PDEs and a challenging 2D mesh-based simulation. We demonstrate that our LAMP outperforms state-of-the-art deep learning surrogate models, and can adaptively trade-off computation to improve long-term prediction error: it achieves an average of 33.7% error reduction for 1D nonlinear PDEs, and outperforms  MeshGraphNets + classical Adaptive Mesh Refinement (AMR) in 2D mesh-based simulations.

    "title": "Where to Begin? On the Impact of Pre-Training and Initialization in Federated Learning",
    "abstract": "An oft-cited challenge of federated learning is the presence of heterogeneity. \\emph{Data heterogeneity} refers to the fact that data from different clients may follow very different distributions. \\emph{System heterogeneity} refers to client devices having different system capabilities. A considerable number of federated optimization methods address this challenge. In the literature, empirical evaluations usually start federated training from random initialization. However, in many practical applications of federated learning, the server has access to proxy data for the training task that can be used to pre-train a model before starting federated training. Using four standard federated learning benchmark datasets, we empirically study the impact of starting from a pre-trained model in federated learning. Unsurprisingly, starting from a pre-trained model reduces the training time required to reach a target error rate and enables the training of more accurate models (up to 40\\%) than is possible when starting from random initialization. Surprisingly, we also find that starting federated learning from a pre-trained initialization reduces the effect of both data and system heterogeneity. We recommend future work proposing and evaluating federated optimization methods to evaluate the performance when starting from random and pre-trained initializations. This study raises several questions for further work on understanding the role of heterogeneity in federated optimization",

This, however, often comes with high computational costs, which raises the question if one can learn an efficient neural network approximation. We show that this is indeed possible for shape spaces with a special product structure, namely those smoothly approximable by a direct sum of low-dimensional manifolds. Our proposed architecture leverages this structure by separately learning approximations for the low-dimensional factors and a subsequent combination. After developing the approach as a general framework, we apply it to a shape space of triangular surfaces. Here, typical examples of data manifolds are given through datasets of articulated models and can be factorized, for example, by a Sparse Principal Geodesic Analysis (SPGA). We demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach with experiments on synthetic data as well as manifolds extracted from data via SPGA",

    "title": "Learning with Stochastic Orders",
    "abstract": "Learning high-dimensional distributions is often done with explicit likelihood modeling or implicit modeling via minimizing integral probability metrics (IPMs). In this paper, we expand this learning paradigm to stochastic orders, namely, the convex or Choquet order between probability measures. Towards this end, exploiting the relation between convex orders and optimal transport, we introduce the Choquet-Toland distance between probability measures, that can be used as a drop-in replacement for IPMs. We also introduce the Variational Dominance Criterion (VDC) to learn probability measures with dominance constraints, that encode the desired stochastic order between the learned measure and a known baseline. We analyze both quantities and show that they suffer from the curse of dimensionality and propose surrogates via input convex maxout networks (ICMNs), that enjoy parametric rates. We provide a min-max framework for learning with stochastic orders and validate it experimentally on synthetic and high-dimensional image generation, with promising results. Finally, our ICMNs class of convex functions and its derived Rademacher Complexity are of independent interest beyond their application in convex orders.

    "title": "MEDFAIR: Benchmarking Fairness for Medical Imaging",
    "abstract": "A multitude of work has shown that machine learning-based medical diagnosis systems can be biased against certain subgroups of people. This has motivated a growing number of bias mitigation algorithms that aim to address fairness issues in machine learning. However, it is difficult to compare their effectiveness in medical imaging for two reasons. First, there is little consensus on the criteria to assess fairness. Second, existing bias mitigation algorithms are developed under different settings, e.g., datasets, model selection strategies, backbones, and fairness metrics, making a direct comparison and evaluation based on existing results impossible. In this work, we introduce MEDFAIR, a framework to benchmark the fairness of machine learning models for medical imaging. MEDFAIR covers eleven algorithms from various categories, ten datasets from different imaging modalities, and three model selection criteria. Through extensive experiments, we find that the under-studied issue of model selection criterion can have a significant impact on fairness outcomes; while in contrast, state-of-the-art bias mitigation algorithms do not significantly improve fairness outcomes over empirical risk minimization (ERM) in both in-distribution and out-of-distribution settings. We evaluate fairness from various perspectives and make recommendations for different medical application scenarios that require different ethical principles. Our framework provides a reproducible and easy-to-use entry point for the development and evaluation of future bias mitigation algorithms in deep learning.

    "abstract": "The problem of how to genetically modify cells in order to maximize a certain cellular phenotype has taken center stage in drug development over the last few years (with, for example, genetically edited CAR-T, CAR-NK, and CAR-NKT cells entering cancer clinical trials). Exhausting the search space for all possible genetic edits (perturbations) or combinations thereof is infeasible due to cost and experimental limitations. This work provides a theoretically sound framework for iteratively exploring the space of perturbations in pooled batches in order to maximize a target phenotype under an experimental budget. Inspired by this application domain, we study the problem of batch query bandit optimization and introduce the Optimistic Arm Elimination (\nOAE\n) principle designed to find an almost optimal arm under different functional relationships between the queries (arms) and the outputs (rewards). We analyze the convergence properties of \nOAE\n by relating it to the Eluder dimension of the algorithm's function class and validate that \nOAE\n outperforms other strategies in finding optimal actions in experiments on simulated problems, public datasets well-studied in bandit contexts, and in genetic perturbation datasets when the regression model is a deep neural network. OAE also outperforms the benchmark algorithms in 3 of 4 datasets in the GeneDisco experimental planning challenge",

In this context, existing methods often use either a Wasserstein metric, or else they apply concurrent barycenter approaches when more than two distributions are considered. In this paper, we  leverage multi-marginal optimal transport (MMOT), where we take advantage of a procedure that computes a generalized earth mover's distance as a sub-routine. We show that not only is our algorithm computationally more efficient compared to other barycentric-based distance methods, but it has the additional advantage that gradients used for backpropagation can be efficiently computed during the forward pass computation itself, which leads to substantially faster model training. We provide technical details about this new regularization term and its properties, and we present experimental demonstrations of faster runtimes when compared to standard Wasserstein-style methods.

This is undesirable because memorization violates privacy (exposing user data), degrades utility (repeated easy-to-memorize text is often low quality), and hurts fairness (some texts are memorized over others).\nWe describe three log-linear relationships that quantify the degree to which LMs emit memorized training data. Memorization significantly grows as we increase (1) the capacity of a model, (2) the number of times an example has been duplicated, and (3) the number of tokens of context used to prompt the model. Surprisingly, we find the situation becomes complicated when generalizing these results across model families. On the whole, we find that memorization in LMs is more prevalent than previously believed and will likely get worse as models continues to scale, at least without active mitigations",

To take a step towards addressing this research bottleneck, this work presents Powderworld, a lightweight yet expressive simulation environment running directly on the GPU. Within Powderworld, two motivating task distributions are presented, one for world-modelling and one for reinforcement learning. Each contains hand-designed test tasks to examine generalization. Experiments indicate that increasing the environment's complexity improves generalization for world models, yet causes reinforcement learning agents to struggle. Powderworld aims to support the study of generalization by providing a source of diverse tasks arising from the same core rules",

    "title": "Differentially Private $L_2$-Heavy Hitters in the Sliding Window Model",
    "abstract": "The data management of large companies often prioritize more recent data, as a source of higher accuracy prediction than outdated data. For example, the Facebook data policy retains user search histories for \n6\n months while the Google data retention policy states that browser information may be stored for up to \n9\n months. These policies are captured by the sliding window model, in which only the most recent \nW\n statistics form the underlying dataset. In this paper, we consider the problem of privately releasing the \nL\n2\n-heavy hitters in the sliding window model, which include \nL\np\n-heavy hitters for \np\n≤\n2\n and in some sense are the strongest possible guarantees that can be achieved using polylogarithmic space, but cannot be handled by existing techniques due to the sub-additivity of the \nL\n2\n norm. Moreover, existing non-private sliding window algorithms use the smooth histogram framework, which has high sensitivity. To overcome these barriers, we introduce the first differentially private algorithm for \nL\n2\n-heavy hitters in the sliding window model by initiating a number of \nL\n2\n-heavy hitter algorithms across the stream with significantly lower threshold. Similarly, we augment the algorithms with an approximate frequency tracking algorithm with significantly higher accuracy. We then use smooth sensitivity and statistical distance arguments to show that we can add noise proportional to an estimation of the \nL\n2\n norm. To the best of our knowledge, our techniques are the first to privately release statistics that are related to a sub-additive function in the sliding window model, and may be of independent interest to future differentially private algorithmic design in the sliding window model",

Our framework represents a wave propagation model generating continuous arrival time to find path solutions informed by a nonlinear first-order PDE called Eikonal Equation. We evaluate our method in various cluttered 3D environments, including the Gibson dataset, and demonstrate its ability to solve motion planning problems for 4-DOF and 6-DOF robot manipulators where the traditional grid-based Eikonal planners often face the curse of dimensionality. Furthermore, the results show that our method exhibits high success rates and significantly lower computational times than the state-of-the-art methods, including NMPs that require training data from classical planners",

Therefore, compressing DRL models possesses immense potential for training acceleration and model deployment. However, existing methods that generate small models mainly adopt the knowledge distillation-based approach by iteratively training a dense network. As a result, the training process still demands massive computing resources. Indeed, sparse training from scratch in DRL has not been well explored and is particularly challenging due to non-stationarity in bootstrap training. In this work, we propose a novel sparse DRL training framework, “the Rigged Reinforcement Learning Lottery” (RLx2), which builds upon gradient-based topology evolution and is capable of training a sparse DRL model based entirely on a sparse network. Specifically, RLx2 introduces a novel multi-step TD target mechanism with a dynamic-capacity replay buffer to achieve robust value learning and efficient topology exploration in sparse models. It also reaches state-of-the-art sparse training performance in several tasks, showing \n7.5\n×\n-\n20\n×\n model compression with less than \n3\n%\n performance degradation and up to \n20\n×\n and \n50\n×\n FLOPs reduction for training and inference, respectively",

    "title": "Sparsity May Cry: Let Us Fail (Current) Sparse Neural Networks Together!",
    "abstract": "Sparse Neural Networks (SNNs) have received voluminous attention predominantly due to growing computational and memory footprints of consistently exploding parameter count in large-scale models. Similar to their dense counterparts, recent SNNs generalize just as well and are equipped with numerous favorable benefits (e.g., low complexity, high scalability, and robustness), sometimes even better than the original dense networks. As research effort is focused on developing increasingly sophisticated sparse algorithms, it is startling that a comprehensive benchmark to evaluate the effectiveness of these algorithms has been highly overlooked. In absence of a carefully crafted evaluation benchmark, most if not all, sparse algorithms are evaluated against fairly simple and naive tasks (eg. CIFAR-10/100, ImageNet, GLUE, etc.), which can potentially camouflage many advantages as well unexpected predicaments of SNNs. In pursuit of a more general evaluation and unveiling the true potential of sparse algorithms, we introduce “Sparsity May Cry” Benchmark (SMC-Bench), a collection of carefully-curated 4 diverse tasks with 10 datasets, that accounts for capturing a wide range of domain-specific and sophisticated knowledge. Our systemic evaluation of the most representative sparse algorithms reveals an important obscured observation: the state-of-the-art magnitude- and/or gradient-based sparse algorithms seemingly fail to perform on SMC-Bench when applied out-of-the-box, sometimes at significantly trivial sparsity as low as 5%. The observations seek the immediate attention of the sparsity research community to reconsider the highly proclaimed benefits of SNNs. We further conduct a thorough investigation into the reasons for the failure of common SNNs. Our analysis points out that such failure is intimately related to the “lazy regime” of large model training, which hints us with stronger pruning recipes that alleviate the failure on SMC-Bench (though still more or less suffering). By incorporating these well-thought and diverse tasks, SMC-Bench is designed to favor and encourage the development of more scalable and generalizable sparse algorithms. We open-source SMC-Bench to assist researchers in building next-generation sparse algorithms that scale and generalize: https://github.com/VITA-Group/SMC-Bench",

Some self-supervised model hardening technique (e.g., contrastive learning) ignores the domain knowledge of MDE and can hardly achieve optimal performance. In this work, we propose a novel adversarial training method for self-supervised MDE models based on view synthesis without using the depth ground truth. We improve adversarial robustness against physical-world attacks using \nL\n0\n-norm-bounded perturbation in training.

    "abstract": "Population dynamics is the study of temporal and spatial variation in the size of populations of organisms and is a major part of population ecology. One of the main difficulties in analyzing population dynamics is that we can only obtain observation data with coarse time intervals from fixed-point observations due to experimental costs or measurement constraints. Recently, modeling population dynamics by using continuous normalizing flows (CNFs) and dynamic optimal transport has been proposed to infer the sample trajectories from a fixed-point observed population. While the sample behavior in CNFs is deterministic, the actual sample in biological systems moves in an essentially random yet directional manner. Moreover, when a sample moves from point A to point B in dynamical systems, its trajectory typically follows the principle of least action in which the corresponding action has the smallest possible value. To satisfy these requirements of the sample trajectories, we formulate the Lagrangian Schrödinger bridge (LSB) problem and propose to solve it approximately by modeling the advection-diffusion process with regularized neural SDE. We also develop a model architecture that enables faster computation of the loss function. Experimental results show that the proposed method can efficiently approximate the population-level dynamics even for high-dimensional data and that using the prior knowledge introduced by the Lagrangian enables us to estimate the sample-level dynamics with stochastic behavior",

In this paper, we observe experimentally that this implicit regularization behavior is {\\em generic}, i.e. it does not depend strongly on the choice of optimizer. We demonstrate this by training neural networks using several gradient-free optimizers, which do not benefit from properties that are often attributed to gradient-based optimizers.   This includes a guess-and-check optimizer that generates uniformly random parameter vectors until finding one that happens to achieve perfect train accuracy, and a zeroth-order Pattern Search optimizer that uses no gradient computations. In the low sample and few-shot regimes, where zeroth order optimizers are most computationally tractable, we find that these non-gradient optimizers achieve test accuracy comparable to SGD.

We prove that such an approach has the same expressivity as the SCF method, yet reduces the computational complexity from O(N^4) to O(N^3). Second, the numerical integration which involves a summation over the quadrature grids can be amortized to the optimization steps. At each step, stochastic gradient descent (SGD) is performed with a sampled minibatch of the grids.

An ideal NP would learn everything from data without any inductive biases, but in practice, we often restrict the class of stochastic processes for the ease of estimation. One such restriction is the use of a finite-dimensional latent variable accounting for the uncertainty in the functions drawn from NPs. Some recent works show that this can be improved with more “data-driven” source of uncertainty such as bootstrapping. In this work, we take a different approach based on the martingale posterior, a recently developed alternative to Bayesian inference. For the martingale posterior, instead of specifying prior-likelihood pairs, a predictive distribution for future data is specified. Under specific conditions on the predictive distribution, it can be shown that the uncertainty in the generated future data actually corresponds to the uncertainty of the implicitly defined Bayesian posteriors. Based on this result, instead of assuming any form of the latent variables, we equip a NP with a predictive distribution implicitly defined with neural networks and use the corresponding martingale posteriors as the source of uncertainty.

    "title": "On the Usefulness of Embeddings, Clusters and Strings for Text Generation Evaluation",
    "abstract": "A good automatic evaluation metric for language generation ideally correlates highly with human judgements of text quality.  Yet, there is a dearth of such metrics, which inhibits the rapid and efficient progress of language generators. One exception is  the recently proposed Mauve. In theory, Mauve measures an information-theoretic divergence between two probability distributions over strings: one representing the language generator under evaluation; the other representing the true natural language distribution. Mauve's authors argue that its success comes from the qualitative properties of their proposed divergence.  Yet in practice, as this divergence is uncomputable, Mauve approximates it by measuring the divergence between multinomial distributions over clusters instead, where cluster assignments are attained by grouping strings based on a pretrained language model's embeddings. As we show, however, this is not a tight approximation---in either theory or practice. This begs the question: why does Mauve work so well? In this work, we show that \\mauve was right for the wrong reasons, and that its newly proposed divergence is not necessary for its high performance. In fact, classical divergences paired with its proposed cluster-based approximation may actually serve as better evaluation metrics. We finish the paper with a probing analysis; this analysis leads us to conclude that---by encoding syntactic- and coherence-level features of text, while ignoring surface-level features---such cluster-based approximations to string distributions may simply be better for evaluating state-of-the-art language generators",

It captures the solution of many classical machine learning problems such as canonical correlation analysis, independent components analysis, partial least squares, linear discriminant analysis, principal components and others. Despite this, most general solvers are prohibitively expensive when dealing with *streaming data sets* (i.e., minibatches) and research has instead concentrated on finding efficient solutions to specific problem instances. In this work, we develop a game-theoretic formulation of the top-\nk\n SGEP whose Nash equilibrium is the set of generalized eigenvectors. We also present a parallelizable algorithm with guaranteed asymptotic convergence to the Nash. Current state-of-the-art methods require \nO\n(\nd\n2\nk\n)\n runtime complexity per iteration which is prohibitively expensive when the number of dimensions (\nd\n) is large.

In Bayesian meta-learning, this is typically achieved by constructing a prior distribution over neural network parameters. However, specifying families of computationally viable prior distributions over the high-dimensional neural network parameters is difficult. As a result, existing approaches resort to meta-learning restrictive diagonal Gaussian priors, severely limiting their expressiveness and performance. To circumvent these issues, we approach meta-learning through the lens of functional Bayesian neural network inference which views the prior as a stochastic process and performs inference in the function space. Specifically, we view the meta-training tasks as samples from the data-generating process and formalize meta-learning as empirically estimating the law of this stochastic process. Our approach can seamlessly acquire and represent complex prior knowledge by meta-learning the score function of the data-generating process marginals instead of parameter space priors. In a comprehensive benchmark, we demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of predictive accuracy and substantial improvements in the quality of uncertainty estimates",

In this paper, we study the case when calculations of explicit gradients are expensive or even infeasible, and only function values are accessible. \nCurrently, there have  two types of gradient-free (zeroth-order) methods based on  random perturbation and negative curvature finding  proposed to escape saddle points  efficiently and converge to an \nϵ\n-approximate second-order stationary point. \nNesterov's accelerated gradient descent (AGD) method can escape saddle points faster than gradient descent (GD) which have been verified in first-order algorithms. However, whether  AGD could accelerate the gradient-free methods is still unstudied. To  unfold this mystery, in this paper, we propose two accelerated  variants for the two types of gradient-free methods of escaping saddle points. We show that our algorithms can find an \nϵ\n-approximate second-order stationary point with \nO\n~\n(\n1\n/\nϵ\n1.75\n)\n iteration complexity and \nO\n~\n(\nd\n/\nϵ\n1.75\n)\n oracle complexity, where \nd\n is the problem dimension.

    "abstract": "Recent large-scale text-driven synthesis diffusion models have attracted much attention thanks to their remarkable capabilities of generating highly diverse images that follow given text prompts. Therefore, it is only natural to build upon these synthesis models to provide text-driven image editing capabilities. However, Editing is challenging for these generative models, since an innate property of an editing technique is to preserve some content from the original image, while in the text-based models, even a small modification of the text prompt often leads to a completely different outcome. State-of-the-art methods mitigate this by requiring the users to provide a spatial mask to localize the edit, hence, ignoring the original structure and content within the masked region. In this paper, we pursue an intuitive prompt-to-prompt editing framework, where the edits are controlled by text only. We analyze a text-conditioned model in depth and observe that the cross-attention layers are the key to controlling the relation between the spatial layout of the image to each word in the prompt. With this observation, we propose to control the attention maps along the diffusion process. Our approach enables us to monitor the synthesis process by editing the textual prompt only, paving the way to a myriad of caption-based editing applications such as localized editing by replacing a word, global editing by adding a specification, and even controlling the extent to which a word is reflected in the image. We present our results over diverse images and prompts with different text-to-image models, demonstrating high-quality synthesis and fidelity to the edited prompts",

In this article, we propose DiffEdit, a method to take advantage of text-conditioned diffusion models for the task of semantic image editing, where the goal is to edit an image based on a text query. Semantic image editing is an extension of image generation, with the additional constraint that the generated image should be as similar as possible to a given input image. \nCurrent editing methods based on diffusion models usually require to provide a mask, making the task much easier by treating it as a conditional inpainting task. In contrast, our main contribution is able to automatically generate a mask highlighting regions of the input image that need to be edited, by contrasting predictions of a diffusion model conditioned on different text prompts. Moreover, we rely on latent inference to preserve content in those regions of interest and show excellent synergies with mask-based diffusion. \nDiffEdit achieves state-of-the-art editing performance on ImageNet. In addition, we evaluate semantic image editing in more challenging settings, using images from the COCO dataset as well as text-based generated images",

Existing diversity metrics are derived by comparing distributions, and thus they cannot quantify the diversity or rarity degree of each generated image. In this work, we propose a new evaluation metric, called `rarity score', to measure both image-wise uncommonness and model-wise diversified generation performance.   \nWe first show empirical observation that typical samples are close to each other and distinctive samples are far from each other in nearest-neighbor distances on latent spaces represented by feature extractor networks such as VGG16. We then show that one can effectively filter typical or distinctive samples with the proposed metric. We also use our metric to demonstrate that the extent to which different generative models produce rare images can be effectively compared. Further, our metric can be used to compare rarities between datasets that share the same concept such as CelebA-HQ and FFHQ. Finally, we analyze the use of metrics in different designs of feature extractors to better understand the relationship between feature spaces and resulting high-rarity images.

Given this corrupted image, an enhancer network learns to either recover all the original image pixels, or predict whether each visual token is replaced by a generator sample or not. The generator and the enhancer are simultaneously trained and synergistically updated. After pre-training, the enhancer can be used as a high-capacity visual encoder for downstream tasks. CIM is a general and flexible visual pre-training framework that is suitable for various network architectures. For the first time, CIM demonstrates that both ViT and CNN can learn rich visual representations using a unified, non-Siamese framework.

This result implies critical security concern in real-world bandit-based systems, e.g., in online recommendation, an attacker might be able to hijack the recommender system and promote a desired product. Our proposed attack algorithms require knowledge of only the regret rate, thus are agnostic to the concrete bandit algorithm employed by the victim player.

    "abstract": "Graph neural network (GNN) is a powerful learning approach for graph-based recommender systems. Recently, GNNs integrated with contrastive learning have shown superior performance in recommendation with their data augmentation schemes, aiming at dealing with highly sparse data. Despite their success, most existing graph contrastive learning methods either perform stochastic augmentation (e.g., node/edge perturbation) on the user-item interaction graph, or rely on the heuristic-based augmentation techniques (e.g., user clustering) for generating contrastive views. We argue that these methods cannot well preserve the intrinsic semantic structures and are easily biased by the noise perturbation. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective graph contrastive learning paradigm LightGCL that mitigates these issues impairing the generality and robustness of CL-based recommenders. Our model exclusively utilizes singular value decomposition for contrastive augmentation, which enables the unconstrained structural refinement with global collaborative relation modeling. Experiments conducted on several benchmark datasets demonstrate the significant improvement in performance of our model over the state-of-the-arts. Further analyses demonstrate the superiority of LightGCL's robustness against data sparsity and popularity bias. The source code of our model is available at https://github.com/HKUDS/LightGCL",

    "abstract": "State space models (SSMs) have demonstrated state-of-the-art sequence modeling performance in some modalities, but underperform attention in language modeling. Moreover, despite scaling nearly linearly in sequence length instead of quadratically, SSMs are still slower than Transformers due to poor hardware utilization. In this paper, we make progress on understanding the expressivity gap between SSMs and attention in language modeling, and on reducing the hardware barrier between SSMs and attention. First, we use synthetic language modeling tasks to understand the gap between SSMs and attention. We find that existing SSMs struggle with two capabilities: recalling earlier tokens in the sequence and comparing tokens across the sequence. To understand the impact on language modeling, we propose a new SSM layer, H3, that is explicitly designed for these abilities. H3 matches attention on the synthetic languages and comes within 0.4 PPL of Transformers on OpenWebText. Furthermore, a hybrid 125M-parameter H3-attention model that retains two attention layers surprisingly outperforms Transformers on OpenWebText by 1.0 PPL. Next, to improve the efficiency of training SSMs on modern hardware, we propose FlashConv. FlashConv uses a fused block FFT algorithm to improve efficiency on sequences up to 8K, and introduces a novel state passing algorithm that exploits the recurrent properties of SSMs to scale to longer sequences. FlashConv yields 2\n×\n speedup on the long-range arena benchmark and allows hybrid language models to generate text 2.4\n×\n faster than Transformers. Using FlashConv, we scale hybrid H3-attention language models up to 2.7B parameters on the Pile and find promising initial results, achieving lower perplexity than Transformers and outperforming Transformers in zero- and few-shot learning on a majority of tasks in the SuperGLUE benchmark",

This induces an Allen-Cahn message passing (ACMP) for graph neural networks where the numerical iteration for the particle system solution constitutes the message passing propagation. ACMP which has a simple implementation with a neural ODE solver can propel the network depth up to one hundred of layers with theoretically proven strictly positive lower bound of the Dirichlet energy.

New instances of such models are typically trained completely from scratch, despite the fact that they are often just scaled-up versions of their smaller counterparts. How can we use the implicit knowledge in the parameters of smaller, extant models to enable faster training of newer, larger models? This paper describes an approach for accelerating transformer training by learning to grow pretrained transformers, where we learn to linearly map  the parameters of the smaller model to initialize the larger model. For tractable learning, we factorize the linear transformation as a composition of  (linear) width- and  depth-growth operators, and further employ a  Kronecker factorization of these growth operators to encode architectural knowledge. Extensive experiments across both language and vision transformers demonstrate that our learned Linear Growth Operator (LiGO)  can save up to 50% computational cost of training from scratch, while also consistently outperforming strong baselines that also reuse smaller pretrained models to initialize larger models",

The combination of offline reinforcement learning with large diverse datasets, however, has the potential to lead to a breakthrough in this challenging domain analogously to the rapid progress made in supervised learning in recent years. To coordinate the efforts of the research community toward tackling this problem, we propose a benchmark including: i) a large collection of data for offline learning from a dexterous manipulation platform on two tasks, obtained with capable RL agents trained in simulation; ii) the option to execute learned policies on a real-world robotic system and a simulation for efficient debugging. We evaluate prominent open-sourced offline reinforcement learning algorithms on the datasets and provide a reproducible experimental setup for offline reinforcement learning on real systems",

    "title": "CUDA: Curriculum of Data Augmentation for Long-tailed Recognition",
    "abstract": "Class imbalance problems frequently occur in real-world tasks, and conventional deep learning algorithms are well known for performance degradation on imbalanced training datasets. To mitigate this problem, many approaches have aimed to balance among given classes by re-weighting or re-sampling training samples. These re-balancing methods increase the impact of minority classes and reduce the influence of majority classes on the output of models. However, the extracted representations may be of poor quality owing to the limited number of minority samples. To handle this restriction, several methods have been developed that increase the representations of minority samples by leveraging the features of the majority samples. Despite extensive recent studies, no deep analysis has been conducted on determination of classes to be augmented and strength of augmentation has been conducted. In this study, we first investigate the correlation between the degree of augmentation and class-wise performance, and find that the proper degree of augmentation must be allocated for each class to mitigate class imbalance problems. Motivated by this finding, we propose a simple and efficient novel curriculum, which is designed to find the appropriate per-class strength of data augmentation, called CUDA: CUrriculum of Data Augmentation for long-tailed recognition. CUDA can simply be integrated into existing long-tailed recognition methods. We present the results of experiments showing that CUDA effectively achieves better generalization performance compared to the state-of-the-art method on various imbalanced datasets such as CIFAR-100-LT, ImageNet-LT, and iNaturalist 2018",

    "abstract": "Transformers have become a default architecture in computer vision, but understanding what drives their predictions remains a challenging problem. Current explanation approaches rely on attention values or input gradients, but these provide a limited view of a model’s dependencies. Shapley values offer a theoretically sound alternative, but their computational cost makes them impractical for large, high-dimensional models. In this work, we aim to make Shapley values practical for vision transformers (ViTs). To do so, we first leverage an attention masking approach to evaluate ViTs with partial information, and we then develop a procedure to generate Shapley value explanations via a separate, learned explainer model. Our experiments compare Shapley values to many baseline methods (e.g., attention rollout, GradCAM, LRP), and we find that our approach provides more accurate explanations than existing methods for ViTs",

To this end, we introduce a novel task of stochastic multi-person 3D motion forecasting. We propose a dual-level generative modeling framework that separately models independent individual motion at the local level and social interactions at the global level. Notably, this dual-level modeling mechanism can be achieved within a shared generative model, through introducing learnable latent codes that represent intents of future motion and switching the codes' modes of operation at different levels. Our framework is general; we instantiate it with different generative models, including generative adversarial networks and diffusion models, and various multi-person forecasting models.

We prove that under certain conditions our networks are universal, i.e., they can approximate any continuous function of eigenvectors with the desired invariances. When used with Laplacian eigenvectors, our networks are provably more expressive than existing spectral methods on graphs; for instance, they subsume all spectral graph convolutions, certain spectral graph invariants, and previously proposed graph positional encodings as special cases. Experiments show that our networks significantly outperform existing baselines on molecular graph regression, learning expressive graph representations, and learning neural fields on triangle meshes.

    "title": "Sequential Latent Variable Models for Few-Shot High-Dimensional Time-Series Forecasting",
    "abstract": "Modern applications increasingly require learning and forecasting latent dynamics from high-dimensional time-series. Compared to univariate time-series forecasting, this adds a new challenge of reasoning about the latent dynamics of an unobserved abstract state. Sequential latent variable models (LVMs) present an attractive solution, although existing works either struggle with long-term forecasting or have difficulty learning across diverse dynamics. In this paper, we first present a conceptual framework of sequential LVMs to unify existing works, contrast their fundamental limitations, and identify an intuitive solution to long-term forecasting for diverse dynamics via meta-learning. We then present the first framework of few-shot forecasting for high-dimensional time-series: instead of learning a single dynamic function, we leverage data of diverse dynamics and learn to adapt latent dynamic functions to few-shot support series. This is realized via Bayesian meta-learning underpinned by: 1) a latent dynamic function conditioned on knowledge derived from few-shot support series, and 2) a meta-model that learns to extract such dynamic-specific knowledge via feed-forward embedding of support set. We compared the presented framework with a comprehensive set of baseline models trained 1) globally on the large meta-training set with diverse dynamics, and 2) individually on single dynamics, both with and without fine-tuning to k-shot support series used by the meta-models. We demonstrated that the presented framework is agnostic to the latent dynamic function of choice and, at meta-test time, is able to forecast for new dynamics given variable-shot of support series",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we leverage low-level compiler intermediate representations (IR) code translation. Traditional transpilers rely on syntactic information and handcrafted rules, which limits their applicability and produces unnatural-looking code. Applying neural machine translation (NMT) approaches to code has successfully broadened the set of programs on which one can get a natural-looking translation. However, they treat the code as sequences of text tokens, and still do not differentiate well enough between similar pieces of code which have different semantics in different languages. The consequence is low quality translation, reducing the practicality of NMT, and stressing the need for an approach significantly increasing its accuracy. Here we propose to augment code translation with IRs, specifically LLVM IR, with results on the C++, Java, Rust, and Go languages. Our method improves upon the state of the art for unsupervised code translation, increasing the number of correct translations by 11% on average, and up to 79% for the Java → Rust pair with greedy decoding. With beam search, it increases the number of correct translations by 5.5% in average. We extend previous test sets for code translation, by adding hundreds of Go and Rust functions. Additionally, we train models with high performance on the problem of IR decompilation, generating programming source code from IR, and study using IRs as intermediary pivot for translation",

However, current methods for training flows either suffer from mode-seeking behavior, use samples from the target generated beforehand by expensive MCMC methods, or use stochastic losses that have high variance. To avoid these problems, we augment flows with annealed importance sampling (AIS) and minimize the mass-covering \nα\n-divergence with \nα\n=\n2\n, which minimizes importance weight variance. Our method, Flow AIS Bootstrap (FAB), uses AIS to generate samples in regions where the flow is a poor approximation of the target, facilitating the discovery of new modes. We apply FAB to multimodal targets and show that we can approximate them very accurately where previous methods fail. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to learn the Boltzmann distribution of the alanine dipeptide molecule using only the unnormalized target density, without access to samples generated via Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations: FAB produces better results than training via maximum likelihood on MD samples while using 100 times fewer target evaluations. After reweighting the samples, we obtain unbiased histograms of dihedral angles that are almost identical to the ground truth",

Subgraph-wise sampling methods---a promising class of mini-batch training techniques---discard messages outside the mini-batches in backward passes to avoid the neighbor explosion problem at the expense of gradient estimation accuracy. This poses significant challenges to their convergence analysis and convergence speeds, which seriously limits their reliable real-world applications. To address this challenge, we propose a novel subgraph-wise sampling method with a convergence guarantee, namely Local Message Compensation (LMC). To the best of our knowledge, LMC is the {\\it first} subgraph-wise sampling method with provable convergence. The key idea of LMC is to retrieve the discarded messages in backward passes based on a message passing formulation of backward passes. By efficient and effective compensations for the discarded messages in both forward and backward passes, LMC computes accurate mini-batch gradients and thus accelerates convergence. We further show that LMC converges to first-order stationary points of GNNs. Experiments on large-scale benchmark tasks demonstrate that LMC significantly outperforms state-of-the-art subgraph-wise sampling methods in terms of efficiency",

This relationship was established by means of a diffusion model that learns data distributions over the stroke-point locations and pen states of real human sketches. Given randomly scattered stroke-points, sketch generation becomes a process of deformation-based denoising, where the generator rectifies positions of stroke points at each timestep to converge at a recognizable sketch. A key innovation was to embed recognizability into the reverse time diffusion process. It was observed that the estimated noise during the reversal process is strongly correlated with sketch classification accuracy. An auxiliary recurrent neural network (RNN) was consequently used to quantify recognizability during data sampling. It follows that, based on the recognizability scores, a sampling shortcut function can also be devised that renders better quality sketches with fewer sampling steps. Finally it is shown that the model can be easily extended to a conditional generation framework, where given incomplete and unfaithful sketches, it yields one that is more visually appealing and with higher recognizability",

    "abstract": "Real-world applications require the classification model to adapt to new classes without forgetting old ones. Correspondingly, Class-Incremental Learning (CIL) aims to train a model with limited memory size to meet this requirement. Typical CIL methods tend to save representative exemplars from former classes to resist forgetting, while recent works find that storing models from history can substantially boost the performance. However, the stored models are not counted into the memory budget, which implicitly results in unfair comparisons. We find that when counting the model size into the total budget and comparing methods with aligned memory size, saving models do not consistently work, especially for the case with limited memory budgets. As a result, we need to holistically evaluate different CIL methods at different memory scales and simultaneously consider accuracy and memory size for measurement. On the other hand, we dive deeply into the construction of the memory buffer for memory efficiency. By analyzing the effect of different layers in the network, we find that shallow and deep layers have different characteristics in CIL. Motivated by this, we propose a simple yet effective baseline, denoted as MEMO for Memory-efficient Expandable MOdel. MEMO extends specialized layers based on the shared generalized representations, efficiently extracting diverse representations with modest cost and maintaining representative exemplars. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets validate MEMO's competitive performance. Code is available at: https://github.com/wangkiw/ICLR23-MEMO",

    "abstract": "Sequence modeling has important applications in natural language processing and computer vision. Recently, the transformer-based models have shown strong performance on various sequence modeling tasks, which rely on attention to capture pairwise token relations, and position embedding to inject positional information. While showing good performance, the transformer models are inefficient to scale to long input sequences, mainly due to the quadratic space-time complexity of attention. To overcome this inefficiency, we propose to model sequences with a relative position encoded Toeplitz matrix and use a Toeplitz matrix-vector production trick to reduce the space-time complexity of the sequence modeling to log linear. A lightweight sub-network called relative position encoder is proposed to generate relative position coefficients with a fixed budget of parameters, enabling the proposed Toeplitz neural network to deal with varying sequence lengths. In addition, despite being trained on 512-token sequences, our model can extrapolate input sequence length up to 14K tokens in inference with consistent performance. Extensive experiments on autoregressive and bidirectional language modeling, image modeling, and the challenging Long-range Arena Benchmark show that our method achieves better performance than its competitors in most downstream tasks while being significantly faster",

Probabilistic rotation regression has raised more and more attention with the benefit of expressing uncertainty information along with the prediction.

In this paper, we draw inspiration from multivariate Laplace distribution and propose a novel Rotation Laplace distribution on SO(3). Rotation Laplace distribution is robust to the disturbance of outliers and enforces much gradient to the low-error region, resulting in a better convergence.

    "abstract": "There has been a debate on the choice of plain vs. hierarchical vision transformers, where researchers often believe that the former (e.g., ViT) has a simpler design but the latter (e.g., Swin) enjoys higher recognition accuracy. Recently, the emerge of masked image modeling (MIM), a self-supervised visual pre-training method, raised a new challenge to vision transformers in terms of flexibility, i.e., part of image patches or tokens are to be discarded, which seems to claim the advantages of plain vision transformers. In this paper, we delve deep into the comparison between ViT and Swin, revealing that (i) the performance gain of Swin is mainly brought by a deepened backbone and relative positional encoding, (ii) the hierarchical design of Swin can be simplified into hierarchical patch embedding (proposed in this work), and (iii) other designs such as shifted-window attentions can be removed. By removing the unnecessary operations, we come up with a new architecture named HiViT (short for hierarchical ViT), which is simpler and more efficient than Swin yet further improves its performance on fully-supervised and self-supervised visual representation learning. In particular, after pre-trained using masked autoencoder (MAE) on ImageNet-1K, HiViT-B reports a 84.6% accuracy on ImageNet-1K classification, a 53.3% box AP on COCO detection, and a 52.8% mIoU on ADE20K segmentation, significantly surpassing the baseline.

Inspired by coordinate inputs of previous neural representation methods, we assign a coordinate to each convolutional kernel in our network based on its position in the architecture, and optimize a predictor network to map coordinates to their corresponding weights. Similarly to the spatial smoothness of visual scenes, we show that incorporating a smoothness constraint over the original network's weights aids NeRN towards a better reconstruction. In addition, since slight perturbations in pre-trained model weights can result in a considerable accuracy loss, we employ techniques from the field of knowledge distillation to stabilize the learning process.

    "abstract": "Disentangling complex data to its latent factors of variation is a fundamental task in representation learning. Existing work on sequential disentanglement mostly provides two factor representations, i.e., it separates the data to time-varying and time-invariant factors. In contrast, we consider multifactor disentanglement in which multiple (more than two) semantic disentangled components are generated. Key to our approach is a strong inductive bias where we assume that the underlying dynamics can be represented linearly in the latent space. Under this assumption, it becomes natural to exploit the recently introduced Koopman autoencoder models. However, disentangled representations are not guaranteed in Koopman approaches, and thus we propose a novel spectral loss term which leads to structured Koopman matrices and disentanglement. Overall, we propose a simple and easy to code new deep model that is fully unsupervised and it supports multifactor disentanglement.

    "abstract": "Deep Ensembles (DE) are a prominent approach for achieving excellent performance on key metrics such as accuracy, calibration, uncertainty estimation, and out-of-distribution detection. However, hardware limitations of real-world systems constrain to smaller ensembles and lower-capacity networks, significantly deteriorating their performance and properties. We introduce Packed-Ensembles (PE), a strategy to design and train lightweight structured ensembles by carefully modulating the dimension of their encoding space. We leverage grouped convolutions to parallelize the ensemble into a single shared backbone and forward pass to improve training and inference speeds. PE is designed to operate within the memory limits of a standard neural network. Our extensive research indicates that PE accurately preserves the properties of DE, such as diversity, and performs equally well in terms of accuracy, calibration, out-of-distribution detection, and robustness to distribution shift.

    "title": "Hidden Markov Transformer for Simultaneous Machine Translation",
    "abstract": "Simultaneous machine translation (SiMT) outputs the target sequence while receiving the source sequence, and hence learning when to start translating each target token is the core challenge for SiMT task. However, it is non-trivial to learn the optimal moment among many possible moments of starting translating, as the moments of starting translating always hide inside the model and can only be supervised with the observed target sequence. In this paper, we propose a Hidden Markov Transformer (HMT), which treats the moments of starting translating as hidden events and the target sequence as the corresponding observed events, thereby organizing them as a hidden Markov model. HMT explicitly models multiple moments of starting translating as the candidate hidden events, and then selects one to generate the target token. During training, by maximizing the marginal likelihood of the target sequence over multiple moments of starting translating, HMT learns to start translating at the moments that target tokens can be generated more accurately. Experiments on multiple SiMT benchmarks show that HMT outperforms strong baselines and achieves state-of-the-art performance",

    "title": "Multi-domain image generation and translation with identifiability guarantees",
    "abstract": "Multi-domain image generation and unpaired image-to-to-image translation are two important and related computer vision problems. The common technique for the two tasks is the learning of a joint distribution from multiple marginal distributions. However, it is well known that there can be infinitely many joint distributions that can derive the same marginals. Hence, it is necessary to formulate suitable constraints to address this highly ill-posed problem. Inspired by the recent advances in nonlinear Independent Component Analysis (ICA) theory, we propose a new method to learn the joint distribution from the marginals by enforcing a specific type of minimal change across domains. We report one of the first results connecting multi-domain generative models to identifiability and shows why identifiability is essential and how to achieve it theoretically and practically. We apply our method to five multi-domain image generation and six image-to-image translation tasks. The superior performance of our model supports our theory and demonstrates the effectiveness of our method. The training code are available at https://github.com/Mid-Push/i-stylegan",

    "title": "Continual evaluation for lifelong learning: Identifying the stability gap",
    "abstract": "Time-dependent data-generating distributions have proven to be difficult for gradient-based training of neural networks, as the greedy updates result in catastrophic forgetting of previously learned knowledge. Despite the progress in the field of continual learning to overcome this forgetting, we show that a set of common state-of-the-art methods still suffers from substantial forgetting upon starting to learn new tasks, except that this forgetting is temporary and followed by a phase of performance recovery. We refer to this intriguing but potentially problematic phenomenon as the stability gap. The stability gap had likely remained under the radar due to standard practice in the field of evaluating continual learning models only after each task. Instead, we establish a framework for continual evaluation that uses per-iteration evaluation and we define a new set of metrics to quantify worst-case performance. Empirically we show that experience replay, constraint-based replay, knowledge-distillation, and parameter regularization methods are all prone to the stability gap; and that the stability gap can be observed in class-, task-, and domain-incremental learning benchmarks. Additionally, a controlled experiment shows that the stability gap increases when tasks are more dissimilar. Finally, by disentangling gradients into plasticity and stability components, we propose a conceptual explanation for the stability gap",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we explore learning statistically consistent classifiers under label noise by estimating the noise transition matrix T. We first provide a holistic view of existing T-estimation methods including those with or without anchor point assumptions.  We unified them into the Minimum Geometric Envelope Operator (MGEO) framework, which tries to find the smallest T (in terms of a certain metric) that elicits a convex hull to enclose the posteriors of all the training data. Although MGEO methods show appealing theoretical properties and empirical results, we find them prone to failing when the noisy posterior estimation is imperfect, which is inevitable in practice. Specifically, we show that MGEO methods are in-consistent even with infinite samples if the noisy posterior is not estimated accurately. In view of this, we make the first effort to address this issue by proposing a novel T-estimation framework via the lens of bilevel optimization, and term it RObust Bilevel OpTimzation (ROBOT). ROBOT paves a new road beyond MGEO framework, which enjoys strong theoretical properties: identifibility, consistency and finite-sample generalization guarantees. Notably, ROBOT neither requires the perfect posterior estimation nor assumes the existence of anchor points. We further theoretically demonstrate that ROBOT is more robust in the case where MGEO methods fail. Experimentally, our framework also shows superior performance across multiple benchmarks",

    "title": "Active Learning in Bayesian Neural Networks with Balanced Entropy Learning Principle",
    "abstract": "Acquiring labeled data is challenging in many machine learning applications with limited budgets. Active learning gives a procedure to select the most informative data points and improve data efficiency by reducing the cost of labeling. The info-max learning principle maximizing mutual information such as BALD has been successful and widely adapted in various active learning applications. However, this pool-based specific objective inherently introduces a redundant selection and further requires a high computational cost for batch selection. In this paper, we design and propose a new uncertainty measure, Balanced Entropy Acquisition (BalEntAcq), which captures the information balance between the uncertainty of underlying softmax probability and the label variable. To do this, we approximate each marginal distribution by Beta distribution. Beta approximation enables us to formulate BalEntAcq as a ratio between an augmented entropy and the marginalized joint entropy. The closed-form expression of BalEntAcq facilitates parallelization by estimating two parameters in each marginal Beta distribution. BalEntAcq is a purely standalone measure without requiring any relational computations with other data points. Nevertheless, BalEntAcq captures a well-diversified selection near the decision boundary with a margin, unlike other existing uncertainty measures such as BALD, Entropy, or Mean Standard Deviation (MeanSD). Finally, we demonstrate that our balanced entropy learning principle with BalEntAcq consistently outperforms well-known linearly scalable active learning methods, including a recently proposed PowerBALD, a simple but diversified version of BALD, by showing experimental results obtained from MNIST, CIFAR-100, SVHN, and TinyImageNet datasets",

    "abstract": "We present the Group Propagation Vision Transformer (GPViT): a novel non- hierarchical (i.e. non-pyramidal) transformer model designed for general visual recognition with high-resolution features. High-resolution features (or tokens) are a natural fit for tasks that involve perceiving fine-grained details such as detection and segmentation, but exchanging global information between these features is expensive in memory and computation because of the way self-attention scales. We provide a highly efficient alternative Group Propagation Block (GP Block) to exchange global information. In each GP Block, features are first grouped to- gether by a fixed number of learnable group tokens; we then perform Group Propagation where global information is exchanged between the grouped fea- tures; finally, global information in the updated grouped features is returned back to the image features through a transformer decoder. We evaluate GPViT on a variety of visual recognition tasks including image classification, semantic seg- mentation, object detection, and instance segmentation. Our method achieves significant performance gains over previous works across all tasks, especially on tasks that require high-resolution outputs, for example, our GPViT-L3 out- performs Swin Transformer-B by 2.0 mIoU on ADE20K semantic segmentation with only half as many parameters.

    "abstract": "Active domain adaptation (DA) aims to maximally boost the model adaptation on a new target domain by actively selecting limited target data to annotate, whereas traditional active learning methods may be less effective since they do not consider the domain shift issue. Despite active DA methods address this by further proposing targetness to measure the representativeness of target domain characteristics, their predictive uncertainty is usually based on the prediction of deterministic models, which can easily be miscalibrated on data with distribution shift. Considering this, we propose a Dirichlet-based Uncertainty Calibration (DUC) approach for active DA, which simultaneously achieves the mitigation of miscalibration and the selection of informative target samples. Specifically, we place a Dirichlet prior on the prediction and interpret the prediction as a distribution on the probability simplex, rather than a point estimate like deterministic models. This manner enables us to consider all possible predictions, mitigating the miscalibration of unilateral prediction. Then a two-round selection strategy based on different uncertainty origins is designed to select target samples that are both representative of target domain and conducive to discriminability. Extensive experiments on cross-domain image classification and semantic segmentation validate the superiority of DUC",

    "title": "Accurate Image Restoration with Attention Retractable Transformer",
    "abstract": "Recently, Transformer-based image restoration networks have achieved promising improvements over convolutional neural networks due to parameter-independent global interactions. To lower computational cost, existing works generally limit self-attention computation within non-overlapping windows. However, each group of tokens are always from a dense area of the image. This is considered as a dense attention strategy since the interactions of tokens are restrained in dense regions. Obviously, this strategy could result in restricted receptive fields. To address this issue, we propose \\textbf{A}ttention \\textbf{R}etractable \\textbf{T}ransformer (ART) for image restoration, which presents both dense and sparse attention modules in the network. The sparse attention module allows tokens from sparse areas to interact and thus provides a wider receptive field. Furthermore, the alternating application of dense and sparse attention modules greatly enhances representation ability of Transformer while providing retractable attention on the input image.We conduct extensive experiments on image super-resolution, denoising, and JPEG compression artifact reduction tasks.

Thus, we conclude that FID is prone to intentional or accidental distortions.

Although more effective than monolithic end-to-end RL policies, this framework suffers from compounding errors in skill chaining, e.g., navigating to a bad location where a stationary manipulation skill can not reach its target to manipulate. To this end, we propose that the manipulation skills should include mobility to have flexibility in interacting with the target object from multiple locations and at the same time the navigation skill could have multiple end points which lead to successful manipulation. We operationalize these ideas by implementing mobile manipulation skills rather than stationary ones and training a navigation skill trained with region goal instead of point goal.

    "abstract": "Traditionally, data valuation is posed as a problem of equitably splitting the validation performance of a learning algorithm among the training data. As a result, the calculated data values depend on many design choices of the underlying learning algorithm. However, this dependence is undesirable for many use cases of data valuation, such as setting priorities over different data sources in a data acquisition process and informing pricing mechanisms in a data marketplace. In these scenarios, data needs to be valued before the actual analysis and the choice of the learning algorithm is still undetermined then. Another side-effect of the dependence is that to assess the value of individual points, one needs to re-run the learning algorithm with and without a point, which incurs a large computation burden. \n\nThis work leapfrogs over the current limits of data valuation methods by introducing a new framework that can value training data in a way that is oblivious to the downstream learning algorithm. Our main results are as follows. \n(1)\n We develop a proxy for the validation performance associated with a training set based on a non-conventional \nclass-wise\n Wasserstein distance\n between the training and the validation set.

    "abstract": "Distillation-aware Neural Architecture Search (DaNAS) aims to search for an optimal student architecture that obtains the best performance and/or efficiency when distilling the knowledge from a given teacher model. Previous DaNAS methods have mostly tackled the search for the neural architecture for fixed datasets and the teacher, which are not generalized well on a new task consisting of an unseen dataset and an unseen teacher, thus need to perform a costly search for any new combination of the datasets and the teachers. For standard NAS tasks without KD, meta-learning-based computationally efficient NAS methods have been proposed, which learn the generalized search process over multiple tasks (datasets) and transfer the knowledge obtained over those tasks to a new task. However, since they assume learning from scratch without KD from a teacher, they might not be ideal for DaNAS scenarios. To eliminate the excessive computational cost of DaNAS methods and the sub-optimality of rapid NAS methods, we propose a distillation-aware meta-accuracy prediction model, DaSS (Distillation-aware Student Search), which can predict a given architecture's final performances on a dataset when performing KD with a given teacher, without having actually to train it on the target task. The experimental results demonstrate that our proposed meta-prediction model successfully generalizes to multiple unseen datasets for DaNAS tasks, largely outperforming existing meta-NAS methods and rapid NAS baselines.

To overcome this limitation, we jointly investigate three novel criteria in our framework CRB for point cloud acquisition - label conciseness, feature representativeness and \ngeometric balance, which hierarchically filters out the point clouds of redundant 3D bounding box labels, latent features and geometric characteristics (e.g., point cloud density) from the unlabeled sample pool and greedily selects informative ones with fewer objects to annotate. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates that the proposed criteria aligns the marginal distributions of the selected subset and the prior distributions of the unseen test set, and minimizes the upper bound of the generalization error. To validate the effectiveness and applicability of CRB, we conduct extensive experiments on the two benchmark 3D object detection datasets of KITTI and Waymo and examine both one-stage (i.e., Second) and two-stage 3D detector (i.e., PV-RCNN). Experiments evidence that the proposed approach outperforms existing active learning strategies and achieves fully supervised performance requiring \n1\n%\n and \n8\n%\n annotations of bounding boxes and point clouds, respectively",

    "abstract": "The long runtime of high-fidelity partial differential equation (PDE) solvers makes them unsuitable for time-critical applications. We propose to accelerate PDE solvers using reduced-order modeling (ROM). Whereas prior ROM approaches reduce the dimensionality of discretized vector fields, our continuous reduced-order modeling (CROM) approach builds a low-dimensional embedding of the continuous vector fields themselves, not their discretization. We represent this reduced manifold using continuously differentiable neural fields, which may train on any and all available numerical solutions of the continuous system, even when they are obtained using diverse methods or discretizations. We validate our approach on an extensive range of PDEs with training data from voxel grids, meshes, and point clouds. Compared to prior discretization-dependent ROM methods, such as linear subspace proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) and nonlinear manifold neural-network-based autoencoders, CROM features higher accuracy, lower memory consumption, dynamically adaptive resolutions, and applicability to any discretization. For equal latent space dimension, CROM exhibits 79\n×\n and 49\n×\n better accuracy, and 39\n×\n and 132\n×\n smaller memory footprint, than POD and autoencoder methods, respectively. Experiments demonstrate 109\n×\n and 89\n×\n wall-clock speedups over unreduced models on CPUs and GPUs, respectively. Videos and codes are available on the project page: https://crom-pde.github.io",

This approach is both distinct from and complementary to the dominant paradigm of joint multimodal training.

We refer to these as Socratic Models (SMs): a modular class of systems in which multiple pretrained models may be composed zero-shot via multimodal-informed prompting to capture new multimodal capabilities, without additional finetuning. We show that these systems provide competitive state-of-the-art performance for zero-shot image captioning and video-to-text retrieval, and also enable new applications such as (i) answering free-form questions about egocentric video, (ii) engaging in multimodal assistive dialogue with people (e.g., for cooking recipes), and (iii) robot perception and planning.

    "abstract": "Graphical structures estimated by causal learning algorithms from time series data can provide highly misleading causal information if the causal timescale of the generating process fails to match the measurement timescale of the data. Existing algorithms provide limited resources to respond to this challenge, and so researchers must either use models that they know are likely misleading, or else forego causal learning entirely. Existing methods face up-to-four distinct shortfalls, as they might a) require that the difference between causal and measurement timescales is known; b) only handle very small number of random variables when the timescale difference is unknown; c) only apply to pairs of variables (albeit with fewer assumptions about prior knowledge); or d) be unable to find a solution given statistical noise in the data. This paper aims to address these challenges. We present an approach that combines constraint programming with both theoretical insights into the problem structure and prior information about admissible causal interactions to achieve speed up of multiple orders of magnitude. The resulting system scales to significantly larger sets of random variables (\n>\n100\n) without knowledge of the timescale difference while maintaining  theoretical guarantees. This method is also robust to edge misidentification and can use parametric connection strengths, while optionally finding the optimal among many possible solutions",

In this paper, we demonstrate that Transformers can generalize well to 3D atomistic graphs and present Equiformer, a graph neural network leveraging the strength of Transformer architectures and incorporating SE(3)/E(3)-equivariant features based on irreducible representations (irreps). First, we propose a simple and effective architecture by only replacing original operations in Transformers with their equivariant counterparts and including tensor products. Using equivariant operations enables encoding equivariant information in channels of irreps features without complicating graph structures. With minimal modifications to Transformers, this architecture has already achieved strong empirical results. Second, we propose a novel attention mechanism called equivariant graph attention, which improves upon typical attention in Transformers through replacing dot product attention with multi-layer perceptron attention and including non-linear message passing. With these two innovations, Equiformer achieves competitive results to previous models on QM9, MD17 and OC20 datasets",

As we demonstrate, MDM is a generic approach, enabling different modes of conditioning, and different generation tasks.

Current deep models learn the classifier in a fully parametric manner, ignoring the latent data structure and lacking simplicity and explainability. DNC instead conducts nonparametric, case-based reasoning; it utilizes sub-centroids of training samples to describe class distributions and clearly explains the classification as the proximity of test data and the class sub-centroids in the feature space. Due to the distance-based nature, the network output dimensionality is flexible, and all the learnable parameters are only for data embedding. That means all the knowledge learnt for ImageNet classification can be completely transferred for pixel recognition learning, under the ‘pre-training and fine-tuning’ paradigm. Apart from its nested simplicity and intuitive decision-making mechanism, DNC can even possess ad-hoc explainability when the sub-centroids are selected as actual training images that humans can view and inspect. Compared with parametric counterparts, DNC performs better on image classification (CIFAR-10, ImageNet) and greatly boots pixel recognition (ADE20K, Cityscapes), with improved transparency and fewer learnable parameters, using various network architectures (ResNet, Swin) and segmentation models (FCN, DeepLabV3, Swin).

This separate and flexible treatment of time and space makes DINo the first data-driven model to combine the following advantages. It extrapolates at arbitrary spatial and temporal locations; it can learn from sparse irregular grids or manifolds; at test time, it generalizes to new grids or resolutions.

These two seemingly contradictory properties impose a trade-off between improving the model’s generalization and maintaining its performance on the original task. Models trained with self-supervised learning tend to generalize better than their supervised counterparts for transfer learning; yet, they still lag behind supervised models on IN1K. In this paper, we propose a supervised learning setup that leverages the best of both worlds. We extensively analyze supervised training using multi-scale crops for data augmentation and an expendable projector head, and reveal that the design of the projector allows us to control the trade-off between performance on the training task and transferability. We further replace the last layer of class weights with class prototypes computed on the fly using a memory bank and derive two models: t-ReX that achieves a new state of the art for transfer learning and outperforms top methods such as DINO and PAWS on IN1K, and t-ReX* that matches the highly optimized RSB-A1 model on IN1K while performing better on transfer tasks.\nCode and pretrained models: https://europe.naverlabs.com/t-rex",

    "abstract": "Neural surface reconstruction aims to reconstruct accurate 3D surfaces based on multi-view images. Previous methods based on neural volume rendering mostly train a fully implicit model with MLPs, which typically require hours of training for a single scene. Recent efforts explore the explicit volumetric representation to accelerate the optimization via memorizing significant information with learnable voxel grids. However, existing voxel-based methods often struggle in reconstructing fine-grained geometry, even when combined with an SDF-based volume rendering scheme. We reveal that this is because 1) the voxel grids tend to break the color-geometry dependency that facilitates fine-geometry learning, and 2) the under-constrained voxel grids lack spatial coherence and are vulnerable to local minima. In this work, we present Voxurf, a voxel-based surface reconstruction approach that is both efficient and accurate. Voxurf addresses the aforementioned issues via several key designs, including 1) a two-stage training procedure that attains a coherent coarse shape and recovers fine details successively, 2) a dual color network that maintains color-geometry dependency, and 3) a hierarchical geometry feature to encourage information propagation across voxels. Extensive experiments show that Voxurf achieves high efficiency and high quality at the same time. On the DTU benchmark, Voxurf achieves higher reconstruction quality with a 20x training speedup compared to previous fully implicit methods.

    "title": "Generating Diverse Cooperative Agents by Learning Incompatible Policies",
    "abstract": "Training a robust cooperative agent requires diverse partner agents. However, obtaining those agents is difficult. Previous works aim to learn diverse behaviors by changing the state-action distribution of agents. But, without information about the task's goal, the diversified agents are not guided to find other important, albeit sub-optimal, solutions: the agents might learn only variations of the same solution. In this work, we propose to learn diverse behaviors via policy compatibility. Conceptually, policy compatibility measures whether policies of interest can coordinate effectively. We theoretically show that incompatible policies are not similar. Thus, policy compatibility—which has been used exclusively as a measure of robustness—can be used as a proxy for learning diverse behaviors. Then, we incorporate the proposed objective into a population-based training scheme to allow concurrent training of multiple agents. Additionally, we use state-action information to induce local variations of each policy. Empirically, the proposed method consistently discovers more solutions than baseline methods across various multi-goal cooperative environments. Finally, in multi-recipe Overcooked, we show that our method produces populations of behaviorally diverse agents, which enables generalist agents trained with such a population to be more robust.\n\nSee our project page at https://bit.ly/marl-lipo",

This paper presents a new framework called Image as Stepping Stone (ISS) for the task by introducing 2D image as a stepping stone to connect the two modalities and to eliminate the need for paired text-shape data. Our key contribution is a two-stage feature-space-alignment approach that maps CLIP features to shapes by harnessing a pre-trained single-view reconstruction (SVR) model with multi-view supervisions: first map the CLIP image feature to the detail-rich shape space in the SVR model, then map the CLIP text feature to the shape space and optimize the mapping by encouraging CLIP consistency between the input text and the rendered images. Further, we formulate a textguided shape stylization module to dress up the output shapes with novel structures and textures. Beyond existing works on 3D shape generation from text, our new approach is general for creating shapes in a broad range of categories, without requiring paired text-shape data. Experimental results manifest that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-arts and our baselines in terms of fidelity and consistency with text. Further, our approach can stylize the generated shapes with both realistic and fantasy structures and textures.

As an interesting bridge between physics and deep learning, the equivariant partial differential operators (PDOs) have drawn much researchers' attention recently. However, to ensure the PDOs translation equivariance, previous works have to require coefficient matrices to be constant and spatially shared for their linearity, which could lead to the sub-optimal feature learning at each position. In this work, we propose a novel nonlinear PDOs scheme that is both spatially adaptive and translation equivariant. The coefficient matrices are obtained by local features through a generator rather than spatially shared. Besides, we establish a new theory on incorporating more equivariance like rotations for such PDOs. Based on our theoretical results, we efficiently implement the generator with an equivariant multilayer perceptron (EMLP). As such equivariant PDOs are generated by neural networks, we call them Neural ePDOs.

    "title": "Designing BERT for Convolutional Networks: Sparse and Hierarchical Masked Modeling",
    "abstract": "We identify and overcome two key obstacles in extending the success of BERT-style pre-training, or masked image modeling, to convolutional networks (convnets): (i) convolution operation cannot handle irregular, randomly masked input images; (ii) the single-scale nature of BERT pre-training is inconsistent with convnet’s hierarchical structure. For (i), we treat unmasked pixels as sparse voxels of 3D point clouds and use sparse convolution to encode. This is the first use of sparse convolution for 2D masked modeling. For (ii), we develop a hierarchical decoder to reconstruct images from multi-scale encoded features. Our method, called Sparse masKed modeling (SparK), is general: it can be used directly on any convolutional model without backbone modifications. We validate it on both classical (ResNet) and modern (ConvNeXt) models: on three downstream tasks, it surpasses both state-of-the-art contrastive learning and transformer-based masked modeling by similarly large margins (around +1.0%). The improvements on object detection and instance segmentation are more significant (up to +3.5%), validating the strong transferability of features learned. We also find SparK’s favorable scaling behavior by observing more gains on larger networks. All of these findings support the promising future of generative pre-training on convnets. Both codes and pre-trained models have been released at https://github.com/keyu-tian/SparK",

    "abstract": "Errors in labels obtained via human annotation adversely affect a trained model's performance. Existing approaches propose ways to mitigate the effect of label error on a model's downstream accuracy, yet little is known about its impact on a model's group-based disparity metrics\\footnote{Group-based disparity metrics like subgroup calibration, false positive rate, false negative rate, equalized odds, and equal opportunity are more often known, colloquially, as \\textit{fairness metrics} in the literature. We use the term group-based disparity metrics in this work.}. Here we study the effect of label error on a model's group-based disparity metrics like group calibration. We empirically characterize how varying levels of label error, in both training and test data, affect these disparity metrics. We find that group calibration and other metrics are sensitive to train-time and test-time label error---particularly for minority groups. For the same level of label error, the percentage change in group calibration error for the minority group is on average 1.5 times larger than the change for the majority group. Towards mitigating the impact of training-time label error, we present an approach to estimate how changing a single training input's label affects a model's group disparity metric on a test set. We empirically assess the proposed approach on a variety of datasets and find a 10-40\\% improvement, compared to alternative approaches, in identifying training inputs that improve a model's disparity metric. The proposed approach can help surface training inputs that may need to be corrected for improving a model's group-based disparity metrics",

We show that, contrary to the general understanding of the method, the gradient at an optimal adversarial example may increase, rather than decrease, the adversarially robust loss. This holds independently of the learning rate. More precisely, we provide a counterexample to a corollary of Danskin's Theorem presented in the seminal paper of Madry et al. (2018) which states that a solution of the inner maximization problem can yield a descent direction for the adversarially robust loss. Based on a correct interpretation of Danskin's Theorem, we propose Danskin's Descent Direction (DDi) and we verify experimentally that it provides better directions than those obtained by a PGD adversary. Using the CIFAR10 dataset we further provide a real world example showing that our method achieves a steeper increase in robustness levels in the early stages of training, and is more stable than the PGD baseline. As a limitation, PGD training of ReLU+BatchNorm networks still performs better, but current theory is unable to explain this",

As solving such a flow is non-trivial and barely possible, we propose a practical implementation to learn flexibly parametric ACNFs via ascent regularization and apply it in two learning cases: maximum likelihood learning for density estimation and minimizing reverse KL divergence for unbiased sampling and variational inference. The learned ACNFs demonstrate faster convergence towards the target distributions, therefore, achieving better density estimations, unbiased sampling and variational approximation at lower computational costs.

    "abstract": "Symbolic regression (SR) is an important technique for discovering hidden mathematical expressions from observed data. Transformer-based approaches have been widely used for machine translation due to their high performance, and are recently highly expected to be used for SR. They input the data points, then output the expression skeleton, and finally optimize the coefficients. However, recent transformer-based methods for SR focus more attention on large scale training data and ignore the ill-posed problem: the lack of sufficient supervision, i.e., expressions that may be completely different have the same supervision because of their same skeleton, which makes it challenging to deal with data that may be from the same expression skeleton but with different coefficients. Therefore, we present a transformer-based model for SR with the ability to alleviate this problem. Specifically, we leverage a feature extractor based on pure residual MLP networks to obtain more information about data points. Furthermore, the core idea is that we propose a joint learning mechanism combining supervised contrastive learning, which makes features of data points from expressions with the same skeleton more similar so as to effectively alleviates the ill-posed problem. The benchmark results show that the proposed method is up to 25% higher with respect to the recovery rate of skeletons than typical transformer-based methods. Moreover, our method outperforms state-of-the-art SR methods based on reinforcement learning and genetic programming in terms of the coefficient of determination (\nR\n2\n)",

Humans, on the other hand, acquire, consolidate, and transfer knowledge between tasks that rarely interfere with the consolidated knowledge.  Accompanied by self-regulated neurogenesis, continual learning in the brain is governed by the rich set of neurophysiological processes that harbor different types of knowledge which are then integrated by the conscious processing. Thus, inspired by Global Workspace Theory of conscious information access in the brain, we propose TAMiL, a continual learning method that entails task-attention modules to capture task-specific information from the common representation space. We employ simple, undercomplete autoencoders to create a communication bottleneck between the common representation space and the global workspace, allowing only the task-relevant information to the global workspace, thereby greatly reducing task interference. Experimental results show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art rehearsal-based and dynamic sparse approaches and bridges the gap between fixed capacity and parameter isolation approaches while being scalable.

In this work, we explain both theoretically and empirically how experience replay biases the outputs of the model towards recent stream observations. Moreover, we propose a simple approach to mitigate this bias online, by changing how the output layer of the model is optimized. We show that our approach improves significantly the learning performance of experience-replay approaches over different datasets.

    "abstract": "Semi-supervised learning (SSL) provides an effective means of leveraging unlabelled data to improve a model’s performance. Even though the domain has received a considerable amount of attention in the past years, most methods present the common drawback of lacking theoretical guarantees. Our starting point is to notice that the estimate of the risk that most discriminative SSL methods minimise is biased, even asymptotically. This bias impedes the use of standard statistical learning theory and can hurt empirical performance. We propose a simple way of removing the bias. Our debiasing approach is straightforward to implement and applicable to most deep SSL methods.  We provide simple theoretical guarantees on the trustworthiness of these modified methods, without having to rely on the strong assumptions on the data distribution that SSL theory usually requires. In particular, we provide generalisation error bounds for the proposed methods. We evaluate debiased versions of different existing SSL methods, such as the Pseudo-label method and Fixmatch, and show that debiasing can compete with classic deep SSL techniques in various settings by providing better calibrated models. Additionally, we provide a theoretical explanation of the intuition of the popular SSL methods.

Deriving from the Bayesian formulation, we develop a principled strategy for possible finetuning, which can be combined with many off-the-shelf Gaussian posterior approximations over DNN parameters. Extensive experiments have been conducted to verify the effectiveness of our method, on common benchmark datasets, and the results demonstrate that our method outperforms recent state-of-the-arts by large margins (roughly 19% absolute increase in average attack success rate on ImageNet), and, by combining with these recent methods, further performance gain can be obtained.

    "abstract": "Under stringent model type and variable distribution assumptions, score-based causal discovery methods learn the directed acyclic graph (DAG) from observational data by evaluating candidate graphs over an averaged score function. Despite the great success in low-dimensional linear systems, it has been observed that these approaches overly exploits easier-to-fit samples, thus inevitably learning spurious edges. Worse still, the common homogeneity assumption of most causal discovery methods can be easily violated due to the widespread existence of heterogeneous data in the real world, resulting in performance vulnerability when noise distributions vary. We propose a simple yet effective model-agnostic framework to boost causal discovery performance by dynamically learning the adaptive weights for the Reweighted Score function, ReScore for short, where the learned weights tailors quantitatively to the important degree of each samples. Intuitively, we leverage the bilevel optimization scheme to alternatively train a standard DAG learner first, then upweight the samples that the DAG learner fails to fit well and downweight the samples that the DAG learner easily extracts the causation information from. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets are carried out to validate the effectiveness of ReScore. We observe consistent and significant boosts in structure learning performance. We further visualize that ReScore concurrently mitigates the influence of spurious edges and generalizes to heterogeneous data. Finally, we perform theoretical analysis to guarantee the structure identifiability and the weight adaptive properties of ReScore. Our codes are available at https://github.com/anzhang314/ReScore",

    "abstract": "Large pre-trained language models have helped to achieve state of the art on a variety of NLP tasks, nevertheless, they still suffer from forgetting when incrementally learning a series of sequential tasks. To alleviate this problem, recent works propose several models enhanced by sparse experience replay and local adaption, which yield satisfactory performance. However, in this paper we find that pre-trained language models like BERT have a potential ability to learn sequentially, even without any sparse memory replay. To verify the ability of BERT to maintain old knowledge, we adopt and re-finetune single-layer probe networks with the parameters of BERT fixed. We investigate the models on two typical kinds of NLP tasks, text classification and extractive question answering. And our experiments reveal that BERT can actually generate high quality representations for previous tasks in a long term, under extremely sparse replay or even no replay. We further introduce a series of methods to interpret the mechanism of forgetting and how memory rehearsal plays a significant role in task incremental learning, which bridges the gap between our new discovery and previous studies about catastrophic forgetting. Additionally, we provide both quantified and visualized results demonstrating that the representation space of BERT is always topologically organised, which guarantees its performance",

Specifically, the inherent conservatism of these on-policy algorithms is exactly what the offline RL method needs to overcome the overestimation. Based on this, we propose Behavior Proximal Policy Optimization (BPPO), which solves offline RL without any extra constraint or regularization introduced compared to PPO.

Assuming that both the data space and latent space can be modeled as Riemannian manifolds, we show how to construct regularization terms in a coordinate-invariant way, and develop geometric generalizations of the denoising autoencoder and reconstruction contractive autoencoder such that the essential properties that enable the estimation of the derivative of the log-probability density are preserved.

    "abstract": "In recent years, contrastive learning achieves impressive results on self-supervised visual representation learning, but there still lacks a rigorous understanding of its learning dynamics. In this paper, we show that if we cast a contrastive objective equivalently into the feature space, then its learning dynamics admits an interpretable form. Specifically, we show that its gradient descent corresponds to a specific message passing scheme on the corresponding augmentation graph. Based on this perspective, we theoretically characterize how contrastive learning gradually learns discriminative features with the alignment update and the uniformity update. Meanwhile, this perspective also establishes an intriguing connection between contrastive learning and Message Passing Graph Neural Networks (MP-GNNs). This connection not only provides a unified understanding of many techniques independently developed in each community, but also enables us to borrow techniques from MP-GNNs to design new contrastive learning variants, such as graph attention, graph rewiring, jumpy knowledge techniques, etc. We believe that our message passing perspective not only provides a new theoretical understanding of contrastive learning dynamics, but also bridges the two seemingly independent areas together, which could inspire more interleaving studies to benefit from each other.

This allows us to directly transfer the optimization guarantee for infinite-width networks to practical finite-width models without excessive overparameterization. On the technical side, our analysis differs from most existing studies on similar mean field dynamics in that we do not require the interaction between particles to be sufficiently weak to obtain a uniform propagation of chaos, because such assumptions may not be satisfied in neural network optimization.

    "title": "Asynchronous Distributed Bilevel Optimization",
    "abstract": "Bilevel optimization plays an essential role in many machine learning tasks, ranging from hyperparameter optimization to meta-learning. Existing studies on bilevel optimization, however, focus on either centralized or synchronous distributed setting. The centralized bilevel optimization approaches require collecting massive amount of data to a single server, which inevitably incur significant communication expenses and may give rise to data privacy risks. Synchronous distributed bilevel optimization algorithms, on the other hand, often face the straggler problem and will immediately stop working if a few workers fail to respond. As a remedy, we propose Asynchronous Distributed Bilevel Optimization (ADBO) algorithm. The proposed ADBO can tackle bilevel optimization problems with both nonconvex upper-level and lower-level objective functions, and its convergence is theoretically guaranteed. Furthermore, it is revealed through theoretic analysis that the iteration complexity of ADBO to obtain the \nϵ\n-stationary point is upper bounded by \nO\n(\n1\nϵ\n2\n)\n. Thorough empirical studies on public datasets have been conducted to elucidate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed ADBO",

    "title": "Confidence-Based Feature Imputation for Graphs with Partially Known Features",
    "abstract": "This paper investigates a missing feature imputation problem for graph learning tasks. Several methods have previously addressed learning tasks on graphs with missing features. However, in cases of high rates of missing features, they were unable to avoid significant performance degradation. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a novel concept of channel-wise confidence in a node feature, which is assigned to each imputed channel feature of a node for reflecting the certainty of the imputation. We then design pseudo-confidence using the channel-wise shortest path distance between a missing-feature node and its nearest known-feature node to replace unavailable true confidence in an actual learning process. Based on the pseudo-confidence, we propose a novel feature imputation scheme that performs channel-wise inter-node diffusion and node-wise inter-channel propagation. The scheme can endure even at an exceedingly high missing rate (e.g., 99.5\\%) and it achieves state-of-the-art accuracy for both semi-supervised node classification and link prediction on various datasets containing a high rate of missing features.

    "title": "LiftedCL: Lifting Contrastive Learning for Human-Centric Perception",
    "abstract": "Human-centric perception targets for understanding human body pose, shape and segmentation. Pre-training the model on large-scale datasets and fine-tuning it on specific tasks has become a well-established paradigm in human-centric perception. Recently, self-supervised learning methods have re-investigated contrastive learning to achieve superior performance on various downstream tasks. When handling human-centric perception, there still remains untapped potential since 3D human structure information is neglected during the task-agnostic pre-training. In this paper, we propose the Lifting Contrastive Learning (LiftedCL) to obtain 3D-aware human-centric representations which absorb 3D human structure information. In particular, to induce the learning process, a set of 3D skeletons is randomly sampled by resorting to 3D human kinematic prior. With this set of generic 3D samples, 3D human structure information can be learned into 3D-aware representations through adversarial learning. Empirical results demonstrate that LiftedCL outperforms state-of-the-art self-supervised methods on four human-centric downstream tasks, including 2D and 3D human pose estimation (0.4% mAP and 1.8 mm MPJPE improvement on COCO 2D pose estimation and Human3.6M 3D pose estimation), human shape recovery and human parsing",

    "title": "Individual Privacy Accounting with Gaussian Differential Privacy",
    "abstract": "Individual privacy accounting enables bounding differential privacy (DP) loss individually for each participant involved in the analysis. This can be informative as often the individual privacy losses are considerably smaller than those indicated by the DP bounds that are based on considering worst-case bounds at each data access. In order to account for the individual losses in a principled manner, we need a privacy accountant for adaptive compositions of mechanisms, where the loss incurred at a given data access is allowed to be smaller than the worst-case loss. This kind of analysis has been carried out for the Rényi differential privacy by Feldman and Zrnic (2021), however not yet for the so-called optimal privacy accountants. We make first steps in this direction by providing a careful analysis using the Gaussian differential privacy which gives optimal bounds for the Gaussian mechanism, one of the most versatile DP mechanisms. This approach is based on determining a certain supermartingale for the hockey-stick divergence and on extending the Rényi divergence-based fully adaptive composition results by Feldman and Zrnic (2021). We also consider measuring the individual  \n(\nε\n,\nδ\n)\n-privacy losses using the so-called privacy loss distributions. Using the Blackwell theorem, we can then use the results of Feldman and Zrnic (2021) to construct an approximative individual \n(\nε\n,\nδ\n)\n-accountant.

    "title": "Evolving Populations of Diverse RL Agents with MAP-Elites",
    "abstract": "Quality Diversity (QD) has emerged as a powerful alternative optimization paradigm that aims at generating large and diverse collections of solutions, notably with its flagship algorithm MAP-ELITES (ME) which evolves solutions through mutations and crossovers. While very effective for some unstructured problems, early ME implementations relied exclusively on random search to evolve the population of solutions, rendering them notoriously sample-inefficient for high-dimensional problems, such as when evolving neural networks. Follow-up works considered exploiting gradient information to guide the search in order to address these shortcomings through techniques borrowed from either Black-Box Optimization (BBO) or Reinforcement Learning (RL). While mixing RL techniques with ME unlocked state-of-the-art performance for robotics control problems that require a good amount of exploration, it also plagued these ME variants with limitations common among RL algorithms that ME was free of, such as hyperparameter sensitivity, high stochasticity as well as training instability, including when the population size increases as some components are shared across the population in recent approaches. Furthermore, existing approaches mixing ME with RL tend to be tied to a specific RL algorithm, which effectively prevents their use on problems where the corresponding RL algorithm fails. To address these shortcomings, we introduce a flexible framework that allows the use of any RL algorithm and alleviates the aforementioned limitations by evolving populations of agents (whose definition include hyperparameters and all learnable parameters) instead of just policies. We demonstrate the benefits brought about by our framework through extensive numerical experiments on a number of robotics control problems, some of which with deceptive rewards, taken from the QD-RL literature. We open source an efficient JAX-based implementation of our algorithm in the QDax library",

    "abstract": "Proximal splitting algorithms are well suited to solving large-scale nonsmooth optimization problems, in particular those arising in machine learning. We propose a new primal–dual algorithm, in which the dual update is randomized; equivalently, the proximity operator of one of the function in the problem is replaced by a stochastic oracle. For instance, some randomly chosen dual variables, instead of all, are updated at each iteration. Or, the proximity operator of a function is called with some small probability only. A nonsmooth variance-reduction technique is implemented so that the algorithm finds an exact minimizer of the general problem involving smooth and nonsmooth functions, possibly composed with linear operators. We derive linear convergence results in presence of strong convexity; these results are new even in the deterministic case, when our algorithms reverts to the recently proposed Primal–Dual Davis–Yin algorithm. Some randomized algorithms of the literature are also recovered as particular cases (e.g., Point-SAGA). But our randomization technique is general and encompasses many unbiased mechanisms beyond sampling and probabilistic updates, including compression. Since the convergence speed depends on the slowest among the primal and dual contraction mechanisms, the iteration complexity might remain the same when randomness is used. On the other hand, the computation complexity can be significantly reduced. Overall, randomness helps getting faster algorithms. This has long been known for stochastic-gradient-type algorithms, and our work shows that this fully applies in the more general primal–dual setting as well",

We demonstrate that the PLMs are well-calibrated on the masked language modeling task with robust predictive confidence under domain shift, yet the fine-tuned models fail to retain such property due to catastrophic forgetting, which impacts the calibration on the downstream classification task. In light of these observations, we evaluate the calibration of several methods that preserve pre-trained features and show that preserving pre-trained features can improve the calibration of fine-tuned language models. Among these methods, our proposed method that encourages the fine-tuned model to learn generative representations with auxiliary language modeling objective achieves competitive accuracy and the lowest expected calibration error compared to several strong baselines under both in-domain and out-of-domain settings on three downstream NLU tasks",

However, the intensive use of complex non-linear functions within the Transformer architecture impairs its computing efficiency and complicates corresponding accelerator designs, because non-linear functions are generally computation-intensive and require special hardware support. In light of this, we propose MA-BERT, which allows matrix arithmetic-only operations in Transformer-based NLP models and achieves efficient inference with negligible accuracy loss. Specifically, we propose four correlated techniques that include approximating softmax with a two-layer neural network, replacing GELU with ReLU, fusing normalization layers with adjacent linear layers, and leveraging knowledge transfer from baseline models. Through these techniques, we are able to eliminate the major non-linear functions in Transformer-based models and obtain MA-BERT with only matrix arithmetic and trivial ReLU operations without compromising on accuracy. With mainly regular matrix arithmetic operations, MA-BERT enables hardware-friendly processing on various computing engines, including CPUs and GPUs. Our experimental results show that MA-BERT achieves up to 27% and 41% reduction in inference time on CPU and GPU, respectively, with comparable accuracy on many downstream tasks compared to the baseline BERT models",

To handle this issue, we propose the Arbitrary Virtual Try-On Network (AVTON) that is utilized for all-type clothes, which can synthesize realistic try-on images by preserving and trading off characteristics of the target clothes and the reference person. Our approach includes three modules: 1) Limbs Prediction Module, which is utilized for predicting the human body parts by preserving the characteristics of the reference person. This is especially good for handling cross-category try-on task (e.g., long sleeves \n↔\n short sleeves or long pants \n↔\n skirts, etc.), where the exposed arms or legs with the skin colors and details can be reasonably predicted; 2) Improved Geometric Matching Module, which is designed to warp clothes according to the geometry of the target person. We improve the TPS-based warping method with a compactly supported radial function (Wendland's \nΨ\n-function); 3) Trade-Off Fusion Module, which is to trade off the characteristics of the warped clothes and the reference person. This module is to make the generated try-on images look more natural and realistic based on a fine-tuning symmetry of the network structure.

To date, there seems to be still no consensus on what the right architecture and pre-training setup should be. This paper presents a unified framework for pre-training models that are universally effective across datasets and setups. We begin by disentangling architectural archetypes with pre-training objectives -- two concepts that are commonly conflated. Next, we present a generalized and unified perspective for self-supervision in NLP and show how different pre-training objectives can be cast as one another and how interpolating between different objectives can be effective. We then propose Mixture-of-Denoisers (MoD), a pre-training objective that combines diverse pre-training paradigms together. We furthermore introduce a notion of mode switching, wherein downstream fine-tuning is associated with specific pre-training schemes. We conduct extensive ablative experiments to compare multiple pre-training objectives and find that our method pushes the Pareto-frontier by outperforming T5 and/or GPT-like models across multiple diverse setups. Finally, by scaling our model up to 20B parameters, we achieve SOTA performance on 50 well-established supervised NLP tasks ranging from language generation (with automated and human evaluation), language understanding, text classification, question answering, commonsense reasoning, long text reasoning, structured knowledge grounding and information retrieval. Our model also achieve strong results at in-context learning, outperforming 175B GPT-3 on zero-shot SuperGLUE and tripling the performance of T5-XXL on one-shot summarization. Finally, we show that UL2 20B works well with chain-of-thought prompting and reasoning, making it an appealing choice for research into reasoning at a small to medium scale of 20B parameters.

For example, an answer to the Sudoku game, a structured code like s-expression, and even a logical natural language answer where the analysis may be generated after the decision. We define the target sequences of those tasks as complex sequences. Obviously, a complex sequence should be constructed with multiple logical steps, and has dependencies among each part of itself (e.g. decisions depend on analyses). It's a great challenge for the classic left-to-right autoregressive generation system to generate complex sequences. Current approaches improve one-pass left-to-right generation on NLG tasks by generating different heuristic intermediate sequences in multiple stages. However, for complex sequences, the heuristic rules to break down them may hurt performance, and increase additional exposure bias. To tackle these challenges, we propose a PLM-friendly autoregressive self-boost refinement framework, CASR. When training, CASR inputs the predictions generated by the model itself at the previous refinement step (instead of those produced by heuristic rules). To find an optimal design, we also discuss model architecture, parameter efficiency and initialization strategy. By evaluating CASR on Sudoku, WebQSP, MTOP and KVRET through controlled experiments and empirical studies, we find that CASR produces high-quality outputs. CASR also improves Accuracy on Sudoku (70.93% --> 97.28%) and achieves state-of-the-art performance on KVRET with Micro F1 score (67.88% --> 70.00%)",

    "abstract": "Training machine learning models robust to distribution shifts is critical for real-world applications. Some robust training algorithms (e.g., Group DRO) specialize to group shifts and require group information on all training points. Other methods (e.g., CVaR DRO) that do not need group annotations can be overly conservative, since they naively upweight high loss points which may form a contrived set that does not correspond to any meaningful group in the real world (e.g., when the high loss points are randomly mislabeled training points). In this work, we address limitations in prior approaches by assuming a more nuanced form of group shift: conditioned on the label, we assume that the true group function (indicator over group) is simple. For example, we may expect that group shifts occur along low bitrate features (e.g.,  image background, lighting). Thus, we aim to learn a model that maintains high accuracy on simple group functions realized by these low bitrate features, that need not spend valuable model capacity achieving high accuracy on contrived groups of examples. Based on this, we consider the two-player game formulation of DRO where the adversary's capacity is bitrate-constrained. Our resulting practical algorithm, Bitrate-Constrained DRO (\\bdro), does not require group information on training samples yet matches the performance of Group DRO on datasets that have training group annotations and that of CVaR DRO on long-tailed distributions. Our theoretical analysis reveals that in some settings \\bdro objective can provably yield statistically efficient and less conservative solutions than unconstrained CVaR DRO",

We propose a principled approach to exploit the geometry of the discrete solution space to treat the solver as a negative identity on the backward pass and further provide a theoretical justification. Our experiments demonstrate that such a straightforward hyper-parameter-free approach is able to compete with previous more complex methods on numerous experiments such as backpropagation through discrete samplers, deep graph matching, and image retrieval.

When a context is \"expected\" its associated linear transformation is applied over feature vectors in a mid level of a network. The result is that mid-level network representations are biased towards conformance with high level expectations, improving overall accuracy and contextual consistency. Additionally, during training mid-level feature vectors are biased through introduction of a loss term which increases the distance between feature vectors associated with different contexts. MVF is agnostic as to the source of contextual expectations, and can serve as a mechanism for top down integration of symbolic systems with deep vision architectures. We show the superior performance of MVF to post-hoc filtering for incorporation of contextual knowledge, and show superior performance of configurations using predicted context (when no context is known a priori) over configurations with no context awareness",

    "abstract": "Federated Learning (FL) is a distributed learning paradigm that enables different parties to train a model together for high quality and strong privacy protection. In this scenario, individual participants may get compromised and perform backdoor attacks by poisoning the data (or gradients). Existing work on robust aggregation and certified FL robustness does not study how hardening benign clients can affect the global model (and the malicious clients). In this work, we theoretically analyze the connection among cross-entropy loss, attack success rate, and clean accuracy in this setting. Moreover, we propose a trigger reverse engineering based defense and show that our method can achieve robustness improvement with guarantee (i.e., reducing the attack success rate) without affecting benign accuracy. We conduct comprehensive experiments across different datasets and attack settings. Our results on nine competing SOTA defense methods show the empirical superiority of our method on both single-shot and continuous FL backdoor attacks.

    "title": "Rethinking Symbolic Regression: Morphology and Adaptability in the Context of Evolutionary Algorithms",
    "abstract": "Symbolic Regression (SR) is the well-studied problem of finding closed-form analytical expressions that describe the relationship between variables in a measurement dataset. In this paper, we rethink SR from two perspectives: morphology and adaptability. Morphology: Current SR algorithms typically use several man-made heuristics to influence the morphology (or structure) of the expressions in the search space. These man-made heuristics may introduce unintentional bias and data leakage, especially with the relatively few equation-recovery benchmark problems available for evaluating SR approaches. To address this, we formulate a novel minimalistic approach, based on constructing a depth-aware mathematical language model trained on terminal walks of expression trees, as a replacement to these heuristics. Adaptability: Current SR algorithms tend to select expressions based on only a single fitness function (e.g., MSE on the training set). We promote the use of an adaptability framework in evolutionary SR which uses fitness functions that alternate across generations. This leads to robust expressions that perform well on the training set and are close to the true functional form. We demonstrate this by alternating fitness functions that quantify faithfulness to values (via MSE) and empirical derivatives (via a novel theoretically justified fitness metric coined MSEDI). Proof-of-concept: We combine these ideas into a minimalistic evolutionary SR algorithm that outperforms all benchmark and state of-the-art SR algorithms in problems with unknown constants added, which we claim are more reflective of SR performance for real-world applications. Our claim is then strengthened by reproducing the superior performance on real-world regression datasets from SRBench. For researchers interested in equation-recovery problems, we also propose a set of conventions that can be used to promote fairness in comparison across SR methods and to reduce unintentional bias",

    "title": "Imitating Graph-Based Planning with Goal-Conditioned Policies",
    "abstract": "Recently, graph-based planning algorithms have gained much attention to solve goal-conditioned reinforcement learning (RL) tasks: they provide a sequence of subgoals to reach the target-goal, and the agents learn to execute subgoal-conditioned policies. However, the sample-efficiency of such RL schemes still remains a challenge, particularly for long-horizon tasks.  To address this issue, we present a simple yet effective self-imitation scheme which distills a subgoal-conditioned policy into the target-goal-conditioned policy. Our intuition here is that to reach a target-goal, an agent should pass through a subgoal, so target-goal- and subgoal- conditioned policies should be similar to each other. We also propose a novel scheme of stochastically skipping executed subgoals in a planned path, which further improves performance. Unlike prior methods that only utilize graph-based planning in an execution phase, our method transfers knowledge from a planner along with a graph into policy learning. We empirically show that our method can significantly boost the sample-efficiency of the existing goal-conditioned RL methods under various long-horizon control tasks",

However, the recent work of [Saunshi et al.] argues that the model architecture --- a component largely ignored by previous works --- also has significant influences on the downstream performance of self-supervised learning. In this work, we provide the first theoretical analysis of self-supervised learning that incorporates the effect of inductive biases originating from the model class. In particular, we focus on contrastive learning --- a popular self-supervised learning method that is widely used in the vision domain. We show that when the model has limited capacity, contrastive representations would recover certain special clustering structures that are compatible with the model architecture, but ignore many other clustering structures in the data distribution. As a result, our theory can capture the more realistic setting where contrastive representations have much lower dimensionality than the number of clusters in the data distribution. We instantiate our theory on several synthetic data distributions, and provide empirical evidence to support the theory",

    "abstract": "Unlike current state-of-the-art language models, young children actively acquire language through interactions with their surrounding environment and caretakers. One mechanism that has been argued to be critical to language learning is the ability to infer the mental states of other agents in social environments, coined Theory of Mind (ToM) by Premack & Woodruff (1978). Drawing inspiration from the modern operationalized versions of ToM implemented in Rabinowitz et al. (2018) and Zhu et al. (2021), we build language-learning agents equipped with ToM, and measure its effects on the learning process. We model ToM by giving the speaker agent an internal listener model that is trained alongside the speaker and used to rerank potential utterances. We experiment with varying task difficulty, hypothesizing that models will acquire more complex language to adapt to stronger environmental pressures. We find that training speakers with a highly weighted ToM listener component leads to performance gains in our image referential game setting. We also find some evidence that increasing task difficulty in the training process results in more fluent and precise utterances in evaluation. This suggests the potential utility of further incorporating ToM, as well as other insights from child language acquisition, into computational models of language acquisition",

    "title": "What Makes Convolutional Models Great on Long Sequence Modeling?",
    "abstract": "Convolutional models have been widely used in multiple domains. However, most existing models only use local convolution, making the model unable to handle long-range dependencies efficiently. Attention overcomes this problem by aggregating global information based on the pair-wise attention score but also makes the computational complexity quadratic to the sequence length. Recently, Gu et al. proposed a model called S4 inspired by the state space model. S4 can be efficiently implemented as a global convolutional model whose kernel size equals the input sequence length. With Fast Fourier Transform, S4 can model much longer sequences than Transformers and achieve significant gains over SoTA on several long-range tasks. Despite its empirical success, S4 is involved. It requires sophisticated parameterization and initialization schemes that combine the wisdom from several prior works. As a result, S4 is less intuitive and hard to use for researchers with limited prior knowledge. Here we aim to demystify S4 and extract basic principles that contribute to the success of S4 as a global convolutional model. We focus on the structure of the convolution kernel and identify two critical but intuitive principles enjoyed by S4 that are sufficient to make up an effective global convolutional model: 1) The parameterization of the convolutional kernel needs to be efficient in the sense that the number of parameters should scale sub-linearly with sequence length. 2) The kernel needs to satisfy a decaying structure that the weights for convolving with closer neighbors are larger than the more distant ones. Based on the two principles, we propose a simple yet effective convolutional model called Structured Global Convolution (SGConv). SGConv exhibits strong empirical performance over several tasks: 1) With faster speed, SGConv surpasses the previous SoTA on Long Range Arena and Speech Command datasets. 2) When plugging SGConv into standard language and vision models, it shows the potential to improve both efficiency and performance",

    "abstract": "Changing how pre-trained models behave---e.g., improving their performance on a downstream task or mitigating biases learned during pre-training---is a common practice when developing machine learning systems. In this work, we propose a new paradigm for steering the behavior of neural networks, centered around task vectors. A task vector specifies a direction in the weight space of a pre-trained model, such that movement in that direction improves performance on the task. We build task vectors by subtracting the weights of a pre-trained model from the weights of the same model after fine-tuning on a task. We show that these task vectors can be modified and combined together through arithmetic operations such as negation and addition, and the behavior of the resulting model is steered accordingly. Moreover, task vectors can be added together to improve performance on multiple tasks at once. Finally, when tasks are linked by an analogy relationship of the form ``A is to B as C is to D\", combining task vectors from three of the tasks can improve performance on the fourth, even when no data from the fourth task is used for training",

    "abstract": "The key to high-level cognition is believed to be the ability to systematically manipulate and compose knowledge pieces. While token-like structured knowledge representations are naturally provided in text, it is elusive how to obtain them for unstructured modalities such as scene images. In this paper, we propose a neural mechanism called Neural Systematic Binder or SysBinder for constructing a novel structured representation called Block-Slot Representation. In Block-Slot Representation, object-centric representations known as slots are constructed by composing a set of independent factor representations called blocks, to facilitate systematic generalization. SysBinder obtains this structure in an unsupervised way by alternatingly applying two different binding principles: spatial binding for spatial modularity across the full scene and factor binding for factor modularity within an object. SysBinder is a simple, deterministic, and general-purpose layer that can be applied as a drop-in module in any arbitrary neural network and on any modality.  In experiments, we find that SysBinder provides significantly better factor disentanglement within the slots than the conventional object-centric methods, including, for the first time, in visually complex scene images such as CLEVR-Tex. Furthermore, we demonstrate factor-level systematicity in controlled scene generation by decoding unseen factor combinations",

    "abstract": "Large-scale diffusion models have achieved state-of-the-art results on text-to-image synthesis (T2I) tasks. Despite their ability to generate high-quality yet creative images, we observe that attribution-binding and compositional capabilities are still considered major challenging issues, especially when involving multiple objects. Attribute-binding requires the model to associate objects with the correct attribute descriptions, and compositional skills require the model to combine and generate multiple concepts into a single image. In this work, we improve these two aspects of T2I models to achieve more accurate image compositions. To do this, we incorporate linguistic structures with the diffusion guidance process based on the controllable properties of manipulating cross-attention layers in diffusion-based T2I models. We observe that keys and values in cross-attention layers have strong semantic meanings associated with object layouts and content. Therefore, by manipulating the cross-attention representations based on linguistic insights, we can better preserve the compositional semantics in the generated image. Built upon Stable Diffusion, a SOTA T2I model, our structured cross-attention design is efficient that requires no additional training samples. We achieve better compositional skills in qualitative and quantitative results, leading to a significant 5-8\\% advantage in head-to-head user comparison studies. Lastly, we conduct an in-depth analysis to reveal potential causes of incorrect image compositions and justify the properties of cross-attention layers in the generation process",

In the past decades, intensive research efforts have only been paid to automate the transistor sizing with a given circuit topology. By recognizing the graph nature of circuits, this paper presents a Circuit Graph Neural Network (CktGNN) that simultaneously automates the circuit topology generation and device sizing based on the encoder-dependent optimization subroutines. Particularly, CktGNN encodes circuit graphs using a two-level GNN framework (of nested GNN) where circuits are represented as combinations of subgraphs in a known subgraph basis. In this way, it significantly improves efficiency by reducing the number of subgraphs to perform message passing.\n\nNonetheless, another critical roadblock to advancing learning-assisted circuit design automation is a lack of public benchmarks to perform canonical assessment and reproducible research. To tackle the challenge, we introduce Open Circuit Benchmark (OCB), an open-sourced dataset that contains \n10\nK distinct operational amplifiers with carefully-extracted circuit specifications from physical implementations. OCB also equips with communicative circuit generation and evaluation capabilities such that it can be used to generalize the applicability of CktGNN to design various analog circuits by efficiently producing corresponding datasets. Experiments on OCB show the extraordinary advantages of CktGNN through representation-based optimization frameworks over other recent powerful GNN baselines and manual design from human experts.

However, most existing spectral graph filters are scalar-to-scalar functions, i.e., mapping a single eigenvalue to a single filtered value, thus ignoring the global pattern of the spectrum. Furthermore, these filters are often constructed based on some fixed-order polynomials, which have limited expressiveness and flexibility. To tackle these issues, we introduce Specformer, which effectively encodes the set of all eigenvalues and performs self-attention in the spectral domain, leading to a learnable set-to-set spectral filter. We also design a decoder with learnable bases to enable non-local graph convolution. Importantly, Specformer is equivariant to permutation. By stacking multiple Specformer layers, one can build a powerful spectral GNN. On synthetic datasets, we show that our Specformer can better recover ground-truth spectral filters than other spectral GNNs. Extensive experiments of both node-level and graph-level tasks on real-world graph datasets show that our Specformer outperforms state-of-the-art GNNs and learns meaningful spectrum patterns.

New augmented time series are generated using a recursive interpolation function from the original time series for use in training. We perform theoretical analysis to characterize the proposed RIM and to guarantee its performance under certain conditions. We apply RIM to diverse synthetic and real-world time series cases to achieve strong performance over non-augmented data on a variety of learning tasks.

However, this balance is challenging to achieve due to a lack of criteria that work both at the mini-batch (local) and aggregated posterior (global) level. In this work, we develop the Goodness of Fit Autoencoder (GoFAE), which incorporates hypothesis tests at two levels. At the mini-batch level, it uses GoF test statistics as regularization objectives. At a more global level, it selects a regularization coefficient based on higher criticism, i.e., a test on the uniformity of the local GoF p-values. We justify the use of GoF tests by providing a relaxed \nL\n2\n-Wasserstein bound on the distance between the latent distribution and target prior. We propose to use GoF tests and prove that optimization based on these tests can be done with stochastic gradient (SGD) descent on a compact Riemannian manifold. Empirically, we show that our higher criticism parameter selection procedure balances reconstruction and generation using mutual information and uniformity of p-values respectively. Finally, we show that GoFAE achieves comparable FID scores and mean squared errors with competing deep generative models while retaining statistical indistinguishability from Gaussian in the latent space based on a variety of hypothesis tests",

Recent ViT-inspired convolutional networks such as ConvMixer and ConvNeXt use large-kernel depthwise convolutions whose learned filters have notable structure; this presents an opportunity to study their empirical covariances. In this work, we first observe that such learned filters have highly-structured covariance matrices, and moreover, we find that covariances calculated from small networks may be used to effectively initialize a variety of larger networks of different depths, widths, patch sizes, and kernel sizes, indicating a degree of model-independence to the covariance structure. Motivated by these findings, we then propose a learning-free multivariate initialization scheme for convolutional filters using a simple, closed-form construction of their covariance. Models using our initialization outperform those using traditional univariate initializations, and typically meet or exceed the performance of those initialized from the covariances of learned filters; in some cases, this improvement can be achieved without training the depthwise convolutional filters at all.

Second, we develop an adversarial training algorithm that learns to create adversarial examples and at the same time optimizes the forecasting model to improve its robustness against such adversarial simulation.

While many prior works have shown that proper regularization techniques are crucial for enabling data-efficient RL, a general understanding of the bottlenecks in data-efficient RL has remained unclear. Consequently, it has been difficult to devise a universal technique that works well across all domains. In this paper, we attempt to understand the primary bottleneck in sample-efficient deep RL by examining several potential hypotheses such as non-stationarity, excessive action distribution shift, and overfitting. We perform thorough empirical analysis on state-based DeepMind control suite (DMC) tasks in a controlled and systematic way to show that high temporal-difference (TD) error on the validation set of transitions is the main culprit that severely affects the performance of deep RL algorithms, and prior methods that lead to good performance do in fact, control the validation TD error to be low. This observation gives us a robust principle for making deep RL efficient: we can hill-climb on the validation TD error by utilizing any form of regularization techniques from supervised learning. We show that a simple online model selection method that targets the validation TD error is effective across state-based DMC and Gym tasks",

We first recall a unified framework of (Hassidim et al., 2020; Beimel et al., 2022; Attias et al., 2023) for answering \nQ\n adaptive queries that incurs \nO\n~\n(\nQ\n)\n overhead in space, which is roughly a quadratic improvement over the na\\\"{i}ve implementation, and only incurs a logarithmic overhead in query time. Although the general framework has diverse applications in machine learning and data science, such as adaptive distance estimation, kernel density estimation, linear regression, range queries, point queries,  and serves as a preliminary benchmark, we demonstrate even better algorithmic improvements for (1) reducing the pre-processing time for adaptive distance estimation and (2) permitting an unlimited number of adaptive queries for kernel density estimation. Finally, we complement our theoretical results with additional empirical evaluations",

    "abstract": "Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved state-of-the-art results on a variety of graph learning tasks, however, it has been demonstrated that they are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, raising serious security concerns. A lot of studies have been developed to train GNNs in a noisy environment and increase their robustness against adversarial attacks. However, existing methods have not uncovered a principled difficulty: the convoluted mixture distribution between clean and attacked data samples, which leads to sub-optimal model design and limits their frameworks’ robustness. In this work, we first begin by identifying the root cause of mixture distribution, then, for tackling it, we propose a novel method GAME - Graph Adversarial Mixture of Experts to enlarge the model capacity and enrich the representation diversity of adversarial samples, from three perspectives of model, training, and optimization. Specifically, we first propose a plug-and- play GAME layer that can be easily incorporated into any GNNs and enhance their adversarial learning capabilities. Second, we design a decoupling-based graph adversarial training in which the component of the model used to generate adversarial graphs is separated from the component used to update weights. Third, we introduce a graph diversity regularization that enables the model to learn diverse representation and further improves model performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and advantages of GAME over the state-of-the-art adversarial training methods across various datasets given different attacks",

    "title": "On Representing Mixed-Integer Linear Programs by Graph Neural Networks",
    "abstract": "While Mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) is NP-hard in general, practical MILP has received roughly 100--fold speedup in the past twenty years. Still, many classes of MILPs quickly become unsolvable as their sizes increase, motivating researchers to seek new acceleration techniques for MILPs. With deep learning, they have obtained strong empirical results, and many results were obtained by applying graph neural networks (GNNs) to making decisions in various stages of MILP solution processes. This work discovers a fundamental limitation: there exist feasible and infeasible MILPs that all GNNs will, however, treat equally, indicating GNN's lacking power to express general MILPs. Then, we show that, by restricting the MILPs to unfoldable ones or by adding random features, there exist GNNs that can reliably predict MILP feasibility, optimal objective values, and optimal solutions up to prescribed precision.  We conducted small-scale numerical experiments to validate our theoretical findings",

    "abstract": "Heterogeneity of data distributed across clients limits the performance of global models trained through federated learning, especially in the settings with highly imbalanced class distributions of local datasets. In recent years, personalized federated learning (pFL) has emerged as a potential solution to the challenges presented by heterogeneous data. However, existing pFL methods typically enhance performance of local models at the expense of the global model's accuracy. We propose FedHKD (Federated Hyper-Knowledge Distillation), a novel FL algorithm in which clients rely on knowledge distillation (KD) to train local models. In particular, each client extracts and sends to the server the means of local data representations and the corresponding soft predictions -- information that we refer to as ``hyper-knowledge\". The server aggregates this information and broadcasts it to the clients in support of local training. Notably, unlike other KD-based pFL methods, FedHKD does not rely on a public dataset nor it deploys a generative model at the server. We analyze convergence of FedHKD and conduct extensive experiments on visual datasets in a variety of scenarios, demonstrating that FedHKD provides significant improvement in both personalized as well as global model performance compared to state-of-the-art FL methods designed for heterogeneous data settings",

In this work, we report a previously unobserved phenomenon in Mixup raining: on a number of standard datasets, the performance of Mixup-trained models starts to decay after training for a large number of epochs, giving rise to a  U-shaped generalization curve. This behavior is further aggravated when the size of original dataset is reduced. To help understand such a behavior of Mixup, we show theoretically that Mixup training may introduce undesired data-dependent label noises to the synthesized data. Via analyzing a least-square regression problem with a random feature model, we explain why noisy labels may cause the U-shaped curve to occur: Mixup improves generalization through fitting the clean patterns at the early training stage,  but as training progresses, Mixup becomes over-fitting to the noise in the synthetic data. Extensive experiments are performed on a variety of benchmark datasets, validating this explanation",

The concise design brings CLIP the advantage in inference efficiency against other vision-language models with heavier cross-attention fusion layers, making it a popular choice for a wide spectrum of downstream tasks. However, CLIP does not explicitly capture the hierarchical nature of high-level and fine-grained semantics conveyed in images and texts, which is arguably critical to vision-language understanding and reasoning. To this end, we equip both the visual and language branches in CLIP with hierarchy-aware attentions, namely Hierarchy-aware CLIP (HiCLIP), to progressively discover semantic hierarchies layer-by-layer from both images and texts in an unsupervised manner. As a result, such hierarchical aggregation significantly improves the cross-modal alignment. To demonstrate the advantages of HiCLIP, we conduct qualitative analysis on its unsupervised hierarchy induction during inference, as well as extensive quantitative experiments on both visual recognition and vision-language downstream tasks",

    "abstract": "A problem with using the Gaussian distribution as a prior for the variational autoencoder (VAE) is that the set on which Gaussians have high probability density is small as the latent dimension increases. This is an issue because VAEs try to attain both a high likelihood with respect to a prior distribution and at the same time, separation between points for better reconstruction. Therefore, a small volume in the high-density region of the prior is problematic because it restricts the separation of latent points.  To ameliorate this, we propose a simple generalization of the Gaussian distribution, called the tilted Gaussian, which has a maximum probability density occurring on a sphere instead of a single point. The tilted Gaussian has exponentially more volume in high-density regions than the standard Gaussian as a function of the distribution dimension. We empirically demonstrate that this simple change in the prior distribution improves VAE performance on the task of detecting unsupervised out-of-distribution (OOD) samples. We also introduce a new OOD testing procedure, called the Will-It-Move test, where the tilted Gaussian achieves remarkable OOD performance",

    "abstract": "Neural language models (LMs) have achieved impressive results on various language-based reasoning tasks by utilizing latent knowledge encoded in their own pretrained parameters. To make this reasoning process more explicit, recent works retrieve a rationalizing LM's internal knowledge by training or prompting it to generate free-text rationales, which can be used to guide task predictions made by either the same LM or a separate reasoning LM. However, rationalizing LMs require expensive rationale annotation and/or computation, without any assurance that their generated rationales improve LM task performance or faithfully reflect LM decision-making. In this paper, we propose PINTO, an LM pipeline that rationalizes via prompt-based learning, and learns to faithfully reason over rationales via counterfactual regularization. First, PINTO maps out a suitable reasoning process for the task input by prompting a frozen rationalizing LM to generate a free-text rationale. Second, PINTO's reasoning LM is fine-tuned to solve the task using the generated rationale as context, while regularized to output less confident predictions when the rationale is perturbed. Across four datasets, we show that PINTO significantly improves the generalization ability of the reasoning LM, yielding higher performance on both in-distribution and out-of-distribution test sets. Also, we find that PINTO's rationales are more faithful to its task predictions than those generated by competitive baselines",

We investigate the excess risk of two-layer ReLU neural networks in a teacher-student regression model, in which a student network learns an unknown teacher network through its outputs. Especially, we consider the student network that has the same width as the teacher network and is trained in two phases: first by noisy gradient descent and then by the vanilla gradient descent. Our result shows that the student network provably reaches a near-global optimal solution and outperforms any kernel methods estimator (more generally, linear estimators), including neural tangent kernel approach, random feature model, and other kernel methods, in a sense of the minimax optimal rate. The key concept inducing this superiority is the non-convexity of the neural network models.

Prior work has shown that pretrained LMs can be taught to ``understand'' visual inputs when the models' parameters are updated on image captioning tasks. We test a stronger hypothesis: that the conceptual representations learned by text-only models are functionally equivalent (up to a linear transformation) to those learned by models trained on vision tasks. Specifically, we show that the image representations from vision models can be transferred as continuous prompts to frozen LMs by training only a single linear projection. Using these to prompt the LM achieves competitive performance on captioning and visual question answering tasks compared to models that tune both the image encoder and text decoder (such as the MAGMA model). We compare three image encoders with increasing amounts of linguistic supervision seen during pretraining: BEIT (no linguistic information), NF-ResNET (lexical category information), and CLIP (full natural language descriptions). We find that all three encoders perform equally well at transferring visual property information to the language model (e.g., whether an animal is large or small), but that image encoders pretrained with linguistic supervision more saliently encode category information (e.g., distinguishing hippo vs.\\ elephant) and thus perform significantly better on benchmark language-and-vision tasks. Our results indicate that LMs encode conceptual information structurally similarly to vision-based models, even those that are solely trained on images",

Contrastive learning methods pull views of samples together and push different samples away, which utilizes semantic invariance of augmentation but ignores the relationship between samples. To better exploit the power of augmentation, we observe that semantically similar samples are more likely to have similar augmented views. Therefore, we can take the augmented views as a special description of a sample. In this paper, we model such a description as the augmentation distribution, and we call it augmentation feature. The similarity in augmentation feature reflects how much the views of two samples overlap and is related to their semantical similarity. Without computational burdens to explicitly estimate values of the augmentation feature, we propose Augmentation Component Analysis (ACA) with a contrastive-like loss to learn principal components and an on-the-fly projection loss to embed data. ACA equals an efficient dimension reduction by PCA and extracts low-dimensional embeddings, theoretically preserving the similarity of augmentation distribution between samples. Empirical results show that our method can achieve competitive results against various traditional contrastive learning methods on different benchmarks",

We analyze and explain bias propagation in federated learning on naturally partitioned real-world datasets. Our analysis reveals that biased parties unintentionally yet stealthily encode their bias in a small number of model parameters, and throughout the training, they steadily increase the dependence of the global model on sensitive attributes. What is important to highlight is that the experienced bias in federated learning is higher than what parties would otherwise encounter in centralized training with a model trained on the union of all their data. This indicates that the bias is due to the algorithm. Our work calls for auditing group fairness in federated learning and designing learning algorithms that are robust to bias propagation",

While much prior work focuses on causal confusion in reinforcement learning and behavioral cloning, we focus on a systematic study of causal confusion and reward misidentification when learning from preferences. In particular, we perform a series of sensitivity and ablation analyses on several benchmark domains where rewards learned from preferences achieve minimal test error but fail to generalize to out-of-distribution states---resulting in poor policy performance when optimized. We find that the presence of non-causal distractor features, noise in the stated preferences, and partial state observability can all exacerbate reward misidentification. We also identify a set of methods with which to interpret misidentified learned rewards. In general, we observe that optimizing misidentified rewards drives the policy off the reward's training distribution, resulting in high predicted (learned) rewards but low true rewards. These findings illuminate the susceptibility of preference learning to reward misidentification and causal confusion---failure to consider even one of many factors can result in unexpected, undesirable behavior",

While there has been substantial progress on understanding the global convergence of policy optimization methods in single-agent RL, designing and analysis of efficient policy optimization algorithms in the MARL setting present significant challenges and new desiderata, which unfortunately, remain highly inadequately addressed by existing theory. In this paper, we focus on the most basic setting of competitive multi-agent RL, namely two-player zero-sum Markov games, and study equilibrium finding algorithms in both the infinite-horizon discounted setting and the finite-horizon episodic setting. We propose a single-loop policy optimization method with symmetric updates from both agents, where the policy is updated via the entropy-regularized optimistic multiplicative weights update (OMWU) method and the value is updated on a slower timescale. We show that, in the full-information tabular setting, the proposed method achieves a finite-time last-iterate linear convergence to the quantal response equilibrium of the regularized problem, which translates to a sublinear convergence to the Nash equilibrium by controlling the amount of regularization. Our convergence results improve upon the best known iteration complexities, and lead to a better understanding of policy optimization in competitive Markov games",

    "abstract": "The low-level sensory and motor signals in deep reinforcement learning, which exist in high-dimensional spaces such as image observations or motor torques, are inherently challenging to understand or utilize directly for downstream tasks. While sensory representations have been extensively studied, the representations of motor actions are still an area of active exploration. Our work reveals that a space containing meaningful action representations emerges when a multi-task policy network takes as inputs both states and task embeddings. Moderate constraints are added to improve its representation ability. Therefore, interpolated or composed embeddings can function as a high-level interface within this space, providing instructions to the agent for executing meaningful action sequences. Empirical results demonstrate that the proposed action representations are effective for intra-action interpolation and inter-action composition with limited or no additional learning. Furthermore, our approach exhibits superior task adaptation ability compared to strong baselines in Mujoco locomotion tasks. Our work sheds light on the promising direction of learning action representations for efficient, adaptable, and composable RL, forming the basis of abstract action planning and the understanding of motor signal space.

However, as models struggle to predict object interactions and track the objects accurately, especially for unseen configurations, using object-centric representations in downstream tasks is still a challenge. This paper proposes STEDIE, a new model that disentangles object representations, based on interactions, into interaction-relevant relational features and interaction-irrelevant global features without supervision. Empirical evaluation shows that the proposed model factorizes global features, unaffected by interactions from relational features that are necessary to predict outcome of interactions.

Yet they often exhibit blurry results when generalized onto unseen identities. Meanwhile, image-based rendering shows high-quality results when sufficient observations are available, whereas it suffers artifacts in sparse-view settings.

    "title": "Federated Neural Bandits",
    "abstract": "Recent works on neural contextual bandits have achieved compelling performances due to their ability to leverage the strong representation power of neural networks (NNs) for reward prediction. Many applications of contextual bandits involve multiple agents who collaborate without sharing raw observations, thus giving rise to the setting of federated contextual bandits}. Existing works on federated contextual bandits rely on linear or kernelized bandits, which may fall short when modeling complex real-world reward functions. So, this paper introduces the federated neural-upper confidence bound (FN-UCB) algorithm. To better exploit the federated setting, FN-UCB adopts a weighted combination of two UCBs: \nUCB\na\n allows every agent to additionally use the observations from the other agents to accelerate exploration (without sharing raw observations), while \nUCB\nb\n uses an NN with aggregated parameters for reward prediction in a similar way to federated averaging for supervised learning. Notably, the weight between the two UCBs required by our theoretical analysis is amenable to an interesting interpretation, which emphasizes \nUCB\na\n initially for accelerated exploration and relies more on \nUCB\nb\n later after enough observations have been collected to train the NNs for accurate reward prediction (i.e., reliable exploitation). We prove sub-linear upper bounds on both the cumulative regret and the number of communication rounds of FN-UCB, and empirically demonstrate its competitive performance",

Most prior work assumed that prompts effectively extract knowledge from language models to facilitate generalization to new tasks. This perspective led to numerous studies on improving prompts. In contrast, we introduce a new perspective, compositional generalization, that views each task as a composition of latent codes and generalizes to test tasks by a new composition of seen codes. To this end, we propose a novel prompt-free approach, Compositional Task Representations (CTR), that employs multi-task training to learn a discrete, compositional codebook. Empirically, our CTR substantially outperforms prompt-based methods in zero-label learning on average.

    "abstract": "Generative adversarial networks (GANs) are challenging to train stably, and a promising remedy of injecting instance noise into the discriminator input has not been very effective in practice.  In this paper, we propose Diffusion-GAN, a novel GAN framework that leverages a forward diffusion chain to generate Gaussian-mixture distributed instance noise. Diffusion-GAN consists of three components, including an adaptive diffusion process, a diffusion timestep-dependent discriminator, and a generator. Both the observed and generated data are diffused by the adaptive diffusion process via different noise-to-data ratios at each timestep. The timestep-dependent discriminator learns to distinguish the diffused real data from the diffused generated data at each diffusion timestep. The generator learns from the discriminator's feedback by backpropagating through the forward diffusion chain, whose length is adaptively adjusted to balance the noise and data levels. We theoretically show that the discriminator's timestep-dependent strategy gives consistent and helpful guidance to the generator, enabling it to match the true data distribution. We demonstrate the advantages of Diffusion-GAN over strong GAN baselines on various datasets, showing that it can produce more realistic images with higher stability and data efficiency than state-of-the-art GANs",

With this observation, we propose a new objective of unsupervised learning for CO where the goal of learning is to search for good initialization for future problem instances rather than give direct solutions. We propose a meta-learning-based training pipeline for this new objective. Our method achieves good performance. We observe that even the initial solution given by our model before fine-tuning can significantly outperform the baselines under various evaluation settings including evaluation across multiple datasets, and the case with big shifts in the problem scale.

Such models typically lead to poor performance during inference for data lacking such correlations. In this work, we explicitly consider a situation where potential spurious correlations are present in the majority of training data. In contrast with existing approaches, which use the ERM model outputs to detect the samples without spurious correlations and either heuristically upweight or upsample those samples, we propose the logit correction (LC) loss, a simple yet effective improvement on the softmax cross-entropy loss, to correct the sample logit. We demonstrate that minimizing the LC loss is equivalent to maximizing the group-balanced accuracy, so the proposed LC could mitigate the negative impacts of spurious correlations. Our extensive experimental results further reveal that the proposed LC loss outperforms state-of-the-art solutions on multiple popular benchmarks by a large margin, an average 5.5% absolute improvement, without access to spurious attribute labels. LC is also competitive with oracle methods that make use of the attribute labels",

In our method, we treat the instruction as the \"program,\" optimized by searching over a pool of instruction candidates proposed by an LLM in order to maximize a chosen score function.

Experiments on 24 NLP tasks show that our automatically generated instructions outperform the prior LLM baseline by a large margin and achieve better or comparable performance to the instructions generated by human annotators on 21/24 tasks.

In DPC, the Langevin corrector, which does not have a direct counterpart in discrete space, is replaced with a discrete MCMC transition defined by a learned corrector kernel. The corrector kernel is trained to make the correction steps achieve asymptotic convergence, in distribution, to the correct marginal of the intermediate diffusion states. Equipped with DPC, we revisit recent transformer-based  non-autoregressive generative models through the lens of discrete diffusion, and find that DPC can alleviate the compounding decoding error due to the parallel sampling of visual tokens.

Our method consists of a novel SE(3)-equivariant coordinate-based network (TF-ONet), that parametrizes the occupancy field of the shape and respects the inherent symmetries of the problem. In contrast to previous shape reconstruction methods that align the input to a regular grid, we operate directly on the irregular point cloud. Our architecture leverages equivariant attention layers that operate on local tokens. This mechanism enables local shape modelling, a crucial property for scalability to large scenes. Given an unoriented, sparse, noisy point cloud as input, we produce equivariant features for each point. These serve as keys and values for the subsequent equivariant cross-attention blocks that parametrize the occupancy field. By querying an arbitrary point in space, we predict its occupancy score. We show that our method outperforms previous SO(3)-equivariant methods, as well as non-equivariant methods trained on SO(3)-augmented datasets. More importantly, local modelling together with SE(3)-equivariance create an ideal setting for SE(3) scene reconstruction.

However, view hierarchies are not always available, and are often corrupted with missing object descriptions or misaligned structure information. As a result, despite the use of view hierarchies could offer short-term gains, it may ultimately hinder the applicability and performance of the model. In this paper, we propose Spotlight, a vision-only approach for mobile UI understanding.

However, our theoretical understanding of this discrepancy is lagging, preventing the development of significant improvements on either algorithm. Recent work advances the hypothesis that Adam and other heuristics like gradient clipping outperform SGD on language tasks because the distribution of the error induced by sampling has heavy tails. This suggests that Adam outperform SGD because it uses a more robust gradient estimate. We evaluate this hypothesis by varying the batch size, up to the entire dataset, to control for stochasticity. We present evidence that stochasticity and heavy-tailed noise  are not major factors in the performance gap between SGD and Adam. Rather, Adam performs better as the batch size increases,  while SGD is less effective at taking advantage of the reduction in noise. This raises the question as to why Adam outperforms SGD in the full-batch setting.

    "abstract": "Data-free model stealing aims to replicate a target model without direct access to either the training data or the target model. To accomplish this, existing methods use a generator to produce samples in order to train a student model to match the target model outputs. To this end, the two main challenges are estimating gradients of the target model without access to its parameters, and generating a diverse set of training samples that thoroughly explores the input space. We propose a Dual Student method where two students are symmetrically trained in order to provide the generator a criterion to generate samples that the two students disagree on. On one hand, disagreement on a sample implies at least one student has classified the sample incorrectly when compared to the target model. This incentive towards disagreement implicitly encourages the generator to explore more diverse regions of the input space. On the other hand, our method utilizes gradients of student models to indirectly estimate gradients of the target model. We show that this novel training objective for the generator network is equivalent to optimizing a lower bound on the generator's loss if we had access to the target model gradients. In other words, our method alters the standard data-free model stealing paradigm by substituting the target model with a separate student model, thereby creating a lower bound which can be directly optimized without additional target model queries or separate synthetic datasets. We show that our new optimization framework provides more accurate gradient estimation of the target model and better accuracies on benchmark classification datasets. Additionally, our approach balances improved query efficiency with training computation cost.

However, this approach struggles as the task complexity increases or when the individual reasoning steps of the task themselves are hard to learn, especially when embedded in more complex tasks. To address this, we propose Decomposed Prompting, a new approach to solve complex tasks by decomposing them (via prompting) into simpler sub-tasks that can be delegated to a library of prompting-based LLMs dedicated to these sub-tasks. This modular structure allows each prompt to be optimized for its specific sub-task, further decomposed if necessary, and even easily replaced with more effective prompts, trained models, or symbolic functions if desired.\nWe show that the flexibility and modularity of Decomposed Prompting allows it to outperform prior work on few-shot prompting using GPT3. On symbolic reasoning tasks, we can further decompose sub-tasks that are hard for LLMs into even simpler solvable sub-tasks. When the complexity comes from the input length, we can recursively decompose the task into the same task but with smaller inputs. We also evaluate our approach on textual multi-step reasoning tasks: on long-context multi-hop QA task, we can more effectively teach the sub-tasks via our separate sub-tasks prompts; and on open-domain multi-hop QA, we can incorporate a symbolic information retrieval within our decomposition framework, leading to improved performance on both tasks.

    "title": "Self-Ensemble Protection: Training Checkpoints Are Good Data Protectors",
    "abstract": "As data becomes increasingly vital, a company would be very cautious about releasing data, because the competitors could use it to train high-performance models, thereby posing a tremendous threat to the company's commercial competence. To prevent training good models on the data, we could add imperceptible perturbations to it. Since such perturbations aim at hurting the entire training process, they should reflect the vulnerability of DNN training, rather than that of a single model. Based on this new idea, we seek perturbed examples that are always unrecognized (never correctly classified) in training. In this paper, we uncover them by model checkpoints' gradients, forming the proposed self-ensemble protection (SEP), which is very effective because (1) learning on examples ignored during normal training tends to yield DNNs ignoring normal examples; (2) checkpoints' cross-model gradients are close to orthogonal, meaning that they are as diverse as DNNs with different architectures. That is, our amazing performance of ensemble only requires the computation of training one model. By extensive experiments with 9 baselines on 3 datasets and 5 architectures, SEP is verified to be a new state-of-the-art, e.g., our small \nℓ\n∞\n=\n2\n/\n255\n perturbations reduce the accuracy of a CIFAR-10 ResNet18 from 94.56% to 14.68%, compared to 41.35% by the best-known method.

    "title": "Effectively Modeling Time Series with Simple Discrete State Spaces",
    "abstract": "Time series modeling is a well-established problem, which often requires that methods (1) expressively represent complicated dependencies, (2) forecast long horizons, and (3) efficiently train over long sequences. State-space models (SSMs) are classical models for time series, and prior works combine SSMs with deep learning layers for efficient sequence modeling. However, we find fundamental limitations with these prior approaches, proving their SSM representations cannot express  autoregressive time series processes. We thus introduce SpaceTime, a new state-space time series architecture that improves all three criteria. For expressivity, we propose a new SSM parameterization based on the companion matrix---a canonical representation for discrete-time processes---which enables SpaceTime's SSM layers to learn desirable autoregressive processes. For long horizon forecasting, we introduce a \"closed-loop\" variation of the companion SSM, which enables SpaceTime to predict many future time-steps by generating its own layer-wise inputs. For efficient training and inference, we introduce an algorithm that reduces the memory and compute of a forward pass with the companion matrix. With sequence length \nℓ\n and state-space size \nd\n, we go from \nO\n~\n(\nd\nℓ\n)\n naïvely to \nO\n~\n(\nd\n+\nℓ\n)\n. In experiments, our contributions lead to state-of-the-art results on extensive and diverse benchmarks, with best or second-best AUROC on 6 / 7 ECG and speech time series classification, and best MSE on 14 / 16 Informer forecasting tasks. Furthermore, we find SpaceTime (1) fits AR(\np\n) processes that prior deep SSMs fail on, (2) forecasts notably more accurately on longer horizons than prior state-of-the-art, and (3) speeds up training on real-world ETTh1 data by 73% and 80% relative wall-clock time over Transformers and LSTMs",

    "title": "A Time Series is Worth 64 Words: Long-term Forecasting with Transformers",
    "abstract": "We propose an efficient design of Transformer-based models for multivariate time series forecasting and self-supervised representation learning. It is based on two key components: (i) segmentation of time series into subseries-level patches which are served as input tokens to Transformer; (ii) channel-independence where each channel contains a single univariate time series that shares the same embedding and Transformer weights across all the series. Patching design naturally has three-fold benefit: local semantic information is retained in the embedding; computation and memory usage of the attention maps are quadratically reduced given the same look-back window; and the model can attend longer history. Our channel-independent patch time series Transformer (PatchTST) can improve the long-term forecasting accuracy significantly when compared with that of SOTA Transformer-based models. We also apply our model to self-supervised pre-training tasks and attain excellent fine-tuning performance, which outperforms supervised training on large datasets. Transferring of masked pre-training performed on one dataset to other datasets also produces SOTA forecasting accuracy",

This paper aims at answering the question of how to efficiently learn and leverage a reward function for training end-to-end (E2E) ToD agents. Specifically, we introduce two generalized objectives for reward-function learning, inspired by the classical learning-to-rank literature. Further, we utilize the learned reward function to guide the training of the E2E ToD agent.

In order to study the generalization behavior of a distilled student, we propose a new theoretical framework that leverages supervision complexity: a measure of alignment between teacher-provided supervision and the student's neural tangent kernel. The framework highlights a delicate interplay among the teacher's accuracy, the student's margin with respect to the teacher predictions, and the complexity of the teacher predictions. Specifically, it provides a rigorous justification for the utility of various techniques that are prevalent in the context of distillation, such as early stopping and temperature scaling. Our analysis further suggests the use of online distillation, where a student receives increasingly more complex supervision from teachers in different stages of their training. We demonstrate efficacy of online distillation and validate the theoretical findings on a range of image classification benchmarks and model architectures",

    "abstract": "With more people publishing their personal data online, unauthorized data usage has become a serious concern. The unlearnable examples strategies have been introduced to prevent third parties from training on the data without permission. They add perturbations to the users’ data before publishing, so as to make the models trained on the perturbed published dataset invalidated. These perturbations have been generated for a specific training setting and a target dataset. However, their unlearnable effects significantly decrease when used in other training settings or datasets. To tackle this issue, we propose a novel unlearnable strategy based on Class-wise Separability Discriminant (CSD), which boosts the transferability of the unlearnable perturbations by enhancing the linear separability. Extensive experiments demonstrate the transferability of the unlearnable examples crafted by our proposed method across training settings and datasets",

Existing hyperbolic networks encode geometric priors not only for the input, but also at every layer of the network. This approach involves repeatedly mapping to and from hyperbolic space, which makes these networks complicated to implement, computationally expensive to scale, and numerically unstable to train. In this paper, we propose a simpler approach: learn a hyperbolic embedding of the input, then map once from it to Euclidean space using a mapping that encodes geometric priors by respecting the isometries of hyperbolic space, and finish with a standard Euclidean network. The key insight is to use a random feature mapping via the eigenfunctions of the Laplace operator, which we show can approximate any isometry-invariant kernel on hyperbolic space. Our method can be used together with any graph neural networks: using even a linear graph model yields significant improvements in both efficiency and performance over other hyperbolic baselines in both transductive and inductive tasks",

By solving it with dynamic programming, we learn a conservative value estimate that \\emph{only} considers transitions observed in the replay memory. Both value and policy regularizers based on this conservative estimate are developed and integrated with model-free learning algorithms. We design the metric \\textit{memory density} to measure the quality of RM-MDP. Our empirical studies quantitatively find a strong correlation between performance improvement and memory density. Our method combines \\emph{Conservative Estimation with Experience Replay (CEER)}, improving sample efficiency by a large margin, especially when the memory density is high. Even when the memory density is low, such a conservative estimate can still help to avoid suicidal actions and thereby improve performance",

In this work, we fall back to discrete \nk\n-subset sampling on the forward pass.

Moreover, we find that data augmentations which encourage invariances can be more valuable than invariance alone, especially on small and medium sized training sets. Following this observation, we show that augmentations induce additional stochasticity during training, effectively flattening the loss landscape",

    "title": "TextGrad: Advancing Robustness Evaluation in NLP by Gradient-Driven Optimization",
    "abstract": "Robustness evaluation against adversarial examples has become increasingly important to unveil the trustworthiness of the prevailing deep models in natural language processing (NLP). However, in contrast to the computer vision domain where the first-order projected gradient descent (PGD) is used as the benchmark approach to generate adversarial examples for robustness evaluation, there lacks a principled first-order gradient-based robustness evaluation framework in NLP. The emerging optimization challenges lie in 1) the discrete nature of textual inputs together with the strong coupling between the perturbation location and the actual content, and 2) the additional constraint that the perturbed text should be fluent and achieve a low perplexity under a language model. These challenges make the development of PGD-like NLP attacks difficult. To bridge the gap, we propose TextGrad, a new attack generator using gradient-driven optimization, supporting high-accuracy and high-quality assessment of adversarial robustness in NLP. Specifically, we address the aforementioned challenges in a unified optimization framework. And we develop an effective convex relaxation method to co-optimize the continuously-relaxed site selection and perturbation variables and leverage an effective sampling method to establish an accurate mapping from the continuous optimization variables to the discrete textual perturbations. Moreover, as a first-order attack generation method, TextGrad can be baked into adversarial training to further improve the robustness of NLP models. Extensive experiments are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of TextGrad not only in attack generation for robustness evaluation but also in adversarial defense. From the attack perspective, we show that TextGrad achieves remarkable improvements in both the attack success rate and the perplexity score over five state-of-the-art baselines. From the defense perspective, TextGrad-enabled adversarial training yields the most robust NLP model against a wide spectrum of NLP attacks",

Thus, the estimated values are defined by the different approaches for estimation, but do not adequately represent the training process from an information-theoretic perspective.

    "abstract": "Machine learning applications frequently come with multiple diverse objectives and constraints that can change over time. Accordingly, trained models can be tuned with sets of hyper-parameters that affect their predictive behavior (e.g., their run-time efficiency versus error rate). As the number of constraints and hyper-parameter dimensions grow, naively selected settings may lead to sub-optimal and/or unreliable results. We develop an efficient method for calibrating models such that their predictions provably satisfy multiple explicit and simultaneous statistical guarantees (e.g., upper-bounded error rates), while also optimizing any number of additional, unconstrained objectives (e.g., total run-time cost). Building on recent results in distribution-free, finite-sample risk control for general losses, we propose Pareto Testing: a two-stage process which combines multi-objective optimization with multiple hypothesis testing. The optimization stage constructs a set of promising combinations on the Pareto frontier. We then apply statistical testing to this frontier only to identify configurations that have (a) high utility with respect to our objectives, and (b) guaranteed risk levels with respect to our constraints, with specifiably high probability. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach to reliably accelerate the execution of large-scale Transformer models in natural language processing (NLP) applications. In particular, we show how Pareto Testing can be used to dynamically configure multiple inter-dependent model attributes—including the number of layers computed before exiting, number of attention heads pruned, or number of text tokens considered—to simultaneously control and optimize various accuracy and cost metrics",

    "abstract": "The past few years have witnessed the great success of Diffusion models~(DMs) in generating high-fidelity samples in generative modeling tasks. A major limitation of the DM is its notoriously slow sampling procedure which normally requires hundreds to thousands of time discretization steps of the learned diffusion process to reach the desired accuracy. Our goal is to develop a fast sampling method for DMs with a much less number of steps while retaining high sample quality. To this end, we systematically analyze the sampling procedure in DMs and identify key factors that affect the sample quality, among which the method of discretization is most crucial. By carefully examining the learned diffusion process, we propose Diffusion Exponential Integrator Sampler~(DEIS). It is based on the Exponential Integrator designed for discretizing ordinary differential equations (ODEs) and leverages a semilinear structure of the learned diffusion process to reduce the discretization error. The proposed method can be applied to any DMs and can generate high-fidelity samples in as few as 10 steps. Moreover, by directly using pre-trained DMs, we achieve state-of-art sampling performance when the number of score function evaluation~(NFE) is limited,  e.g., 4.17 FID with 10 NFEs, 2.86 FID with only 20 NFEs on CIFAR10",

Because of this, current attacks fail to extract any meaningful data under large-scale aggregation. In realistic settings, an attacker cares most about a small portion of user data that contains sensitive personal information, for example sequences containing the phrase \"my credit card number is ...\". In this work, we propose the first attack on FL that achieves targeted extraction of sequences that contain privacy-critical phrases, whereby we employ maliciously modified parameters to allow the transformer itself to filter relevant sequences from aggregated user data and encode them in the gradient update.

    "abstract": "Biological neural networks are capable of recruiting different sets of neurons to encode different memories. However, when training artificial neural networks on a set of tasks, typically, no mechanism is employed for selectively producing anything analogous to these neuronal ensembles. Further, artificial neural networks suffer from catastrophic forgetting, where the network's performance rapidly deteriorates as tasks are learned sequentially. By contrast, sequential learning is possible for a range of biological organisms. We introduce Learned Context Dependent Gating (LXDG), a method to flexibly allocate and recall `artificial neuronal ensembles', using a particular network structure and a new set of regularization terms. Activities in the hidden layers of the network are modulated by gates, which are dynamically produced during training. The gates are outputs of networks themselves, trained with a sigmoid output activation. The regularization terms we have introduced correspond to properties exhibited by biological neuronal ensembles. The first term penalizes low gate sparsity, ensuring that only a specified fraction of the network is used. The second term ensures that previously learned gates are recalled when the network is presented with input from previously learned tasks. Finally, there is a regularization term responsible for ensuring that new tasks are encoded in gates that are as orthogonal as possible from previously used ones. We demonstrate the ability of this method to alleviate catastrophic forgetting on continual learning benchmarks. When the new regularization terms are included in the model along with Elastic Weight Consolidation (EWC) it achieves better performance on the benchmark `permuted MNIST' than with EWC alone. The benchmark `rotated MNIST' demonstrates how similar tasks recruit similar neurons to the artificial neuronal ensemble",

In particular, the semi-supervised learning approach we consider first trains a two-layer neural network based on the unlabeled data with the help of pseudo-labelers. Then it linearly probes the pre-trained network on a small amount of labeled data. We prove that, under a certain toy data generation model and two-layer convolutional neural network, the semisupervised learning approach can achieve nearly zero test loss, while a neural network directly trained by supervised learning on the same amount of labeled data can only achieve constant test loss.

    "abstract": "Certified robustness in machine learning has primarily focused on adversarial perturbations with a fixed attack budget for each sample in the input distribution. In this work, we present provable robustness guarantees on the accuracy of a model under bounded Wasserstein shifts of the data distribution. We show that a simple procedure that randomizes the input of the model within a transformation space is provably robust to distributional shifts under that transformation. Our framework allows the datum-specific perturbation size to vary across different points in the input distribution and is general enough to include fixed-sized perturbations as well. Our certificates produce guaranteed lower bounds on the performance of the model for any shift (natural or adversarial) of the input distribution within a Wasserstein ball around the original distribution. We apply our technique to certify robustness against natural (non-adversarial) transformations of images such as color shifts, hue shifts, and changes in brightness and saturation. We obtain strong performance guarantees for the robust model under clearly visible shifts in the input images. Our experiments establish the non-vacuousness of our certificates by showing that the certified lower bound on a robust model's accuracy is higher than the empirical accuracy of an undefended model under a distribution shift. Moreover, our results also imply guaranteed lower bounds (hardness result) on the performance of models trained on so-called \"unlearnable\" datasets that have been poisoned to interfere with model training. We show that the performance of a robust model is guaranteed to remain above a certain threshold on the test distribution even when the base model is trained on the poisoned dataset",

    "abstract": "Transfer learning is known to perform efficiently in many applications empirically, yet limited literature reports the mechanism behind the scene. This study establishes both formal derivations and heuristic analysis to formulate the theory of transfer learning in deep learning. Our framework utilizing layer variational analysis proves that the success of transfer learning can be guaranteed with corresponding data conditions. Moreover, our theoretical calculation yields intuitive interpretations towards the knowledge transfer process. Subsequently, an alternative method for network-based transfer learning is derived. The method shows an increase in efficiency and accuracy for domain adaptation. It is particularly advantageous when new domain data is sufficiently sparse during adaptation. Numerical experiments over diverse tasks validated our theory and verified that our analytic expression achieved better performance in domain adaptation than the gradient descent method",

    "title": "Denoising Diffusion Samplers",
    "abstract": "Denoising diffusion models are a popular class of generative models providing state-of-the-art results in many domains. One adds gradually noise to data using a diffusion to transform the data distribution into a Gaussian distribution. Samples from the generative model are then obtained by simulating an approximation of the time-reversal of this diffusion initialized by Gaussian samples. Practically, the intractable score terms appearing in the time-reversed process are approximated using score matching techniques. We explore here a similar idea to sample approximately from unnormalized probability density functions and estimate their normalizing constants. We consider a process where the target density diffuses towards a Gaussian. Denoising Diffusion Samplers (DDS) are obtained by approximating the corresponding time-reversal.  While score matching is not applicable in this context, we can leverage many of the ideas introduced in generative modeling for Monte Carlo sampling. Existing theoretical results from denoising diffusion models also provide theoretical guarantees for DDS. We discuss the connections between DDS, optimal control and Schr\\\"odinger bridges and finally demonstrate DDS experimentally on a variety of challenging sampling tasks",

    "title": "How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love Retraining",
    "abstract": "Many Neural Network Pruning approaches consist of several iterative training and pruning steps, seemingly losing a significant amount of their performance after pruning and then recovering it in the subsequent retraining phase. Recent works of Renda et al. (2020) and Le & Hua (2021) demonstrate the significance of the learning rate schedule during the retraining phase and propose specific heuristics for choosing such a schedule for IMP (Han et al., 2015). We place these findings in the context of the results of Li et al. (2020) regarding the training of models within a fixed training budget and demonstrate that, consequently, the retraining phase can be massively shortened using a simple linear learning rate schedule. Improving on existing retraining approaches, we additionally propose a method to adaptively select the initial value of the linear schedule. Going a step further, we propose similarly imposing a budget on the initial dense training phase and show that the resulting simple and efficient method is capable of outperforming significantly more complex or heavily parameterized state-of-the-art approaches that attempt to sparsify the network during training. These findings not only advance our understanding of the retraining phase, but more broadly question the belief that one should aim to avoid the need for retraining and reduce the negative effects of ‘hard’ pruning by incorporating the sparsification process into the standard training",

    "title": "Interpretable Geometric Deep Learning via Learnable Randomness Injection",
    "abstract": "Point cloud data is ubiquitous in scientific fields. Recently, geometric deep learning (GDL) has been widely applied to solve prediction tasks with such data. However, GDL models are often complicated and hardly interpretable, which poses concerns to scientists who are to deploy these models in scientific analysis and experiments. This work proposes a general mechanism, learnable randomness injection (LRI), which allows building inherently interpretable models based on general GDL backbones. LRI-induced models, once trained, can detect the points in the point cloud data that carry information indicative of the prediction label. We also propose four datasets from real scientific applications that cover the domains of high-energy physics and biochemistry to evaluate the LRI mechanism. Compared with previous post-hoc interpretation methods, the points detected by LRI align much better and stabler with the ground-truth patterns that have actual scientific meanings. LRI is grounded by the information bottleneck principle, and thus LRI-induced models are also more robust to distribution shifts between training and test scenarios.

    "abstract": "Using noisy crowdsourced labels from multiple annotators, a deep learning-based end-to-end (E2E) system aims to learn the label correction mechanism and the neural classifier simultaneously. To this end, many E2E systems concatenate the neural classifier with multiple annotator-specific label confusion layers and co-train the two parts in a parameter-coupled manner. The formulated coupled cross-entropy minimization (CCEM)-type criteria are intuitive and work well in practice. Nonetheless, theoretical understanding of the CCEM criterion has been limited. The contribution of this work is twofold: First, performance guarantees of the CCEM criterion are presented. Our analysis reveals for the first time that the CCEM can indeed correctly identify the annotators' confusion characteristics and the desired ``ground-truth'' neural classifier under realistic conditions, e.g., when only incomplete annotator labeling and finite samples are available. Second, based on the insights learned from our analysis, two regularized variants of the CCEM are proposed.  The regularization terms provably enhance the identifiability of the target model parameters in various more challenging cases. A series of synthetic and real data experiments are presented to showcase the effectiveness of our approach",

    "title": "First Steps Toward Understanding the Extrapolation of Nonlinear Models to Unseen Domains",
    "abstract": "Real-world machine learning applications often involve deploying neural networks to domains that are not seen in the training time. Hence, we need to understand the extrapolation of \\textit{nonlinear} models---under what conditions on the distributions and function class, models can be guaranteed to extrapolate to new test distributions. The question is very challenging because even two-layer neural networks cannot be guaranteed to extrapolate outside the support of the training distribution without further assumptions on the domain shift. This paper makes some initial steps towards analyzing the extrapolation of nonlinear models for structured domain shift. We primarily consider settings where the \\textit{marginal} distribution of each coordinate of the data (or subset of coordinates) do not shift significantly across the training and test distributions, but the joint distribution may have a much bigger shift. We prove that the family of nonlinear models of the form \nf\n(\nx\n)\n=\n∑\nf\ni\n(\nx\ni\n)\n, where \nf\ni\n is an \\emph{arbitrary} function on the subset of features \nx\ni\n, can extrapolate to unseen distributions, if the covariance of the features is well-conditioned. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first result that goes beyond linear models and the bounded density ratio assumption, even though the assumptions on the distribution shift and function class are stylized",

    "title": "Compositionality with Variation Reliably Emerges in Neural Networks",
    "abstract": "Human languages enable robust generalization, letting us leverage our prior experience to communicate about novel meanings. This is partly due to language being compositional, where the meaning of a whole expression is a function of its parts. Natural languages also exhibit extensive variation, encoding meaning predictably enough to enable generalization without limiting speakers to one and only one way of expressing something. Previous work looking at the languages that emerge between neural networks in a communicative task has shown languages that enable robust communication and generalization reliably emerge. Despite this those languages score poorly on existing measures of compositionality leading to claims that a language's degree of compositionality has little bearing on how well it can generalise. We argue that the languages that emerge between networks are in fact straightforwardly compositional, but with a degree of natural language-like variation that can obscure their compositionality from existing measures. We introduce 4 measures of linguistic variation and show that early in training measures of variation correlate with generalization performance, but that this effect goes away over time as the languages that emerge become regular enough to generalize robustly. Like natural languages, emergent languages appear able to support a high degree of variation while retaining the generalizability we expect from compositionality. In an effort to decrease the variability of emergent languages we show how reducing a model's capacity results in greater regularity, in line with claims about factors shaping the emergence of regularity in human language",

    "title": "A Mixture-of-Expert Approach to RL-based Dialogue Management",
    "abstract": "Despite recent advancements in language models (LMs), their application to dialogue management (DM) problems and ability to carry on rich conversations remain a challenge. We use reinforcement learning (RL) to develop a dialogue agent that avoids being short-sighted (outputting generic utterances) and maximizes overall user satisfaction. Most existing RL approaches to DM train the agent at the word-level, and thus, have to deal with a combinatorially complex action space even for a medium-size vocabulary. As a result, they struggle to produce a successful and engaging dialogue even if they are warm-started with a pre-trained LM. To address this issue, we develop a RL-based DM using a novel mixture of expert language model (MoE-LM) that consists of (i) a LM capable of learning diverse semantics for conversation histories, (ii) a number of specialized LMs (or experts) capable of generating utterances corresponding to a particular attribute or personality, and (iii) a RL-based DM that performs dialogue planning with the utterances generated by the experts. Our MoE approach provides greater flexibility to generate sensible utterances with different intents and allows RL to focus on conversational-level DM. We compare it with SOTA baselines on open-domain dialogues and demonstrate its effectiveness both in terms of the diversity and sensibility of the generated utterances and the overall DM performance",

PC networks (PCNs) are trained in two phases. First, neural activities are updated to optimize the network's response to external stimuli. Second, synaptic weights are updated to consolidate this change in activity --- an algorithm called \\emph{prospective configuration}. While previous work has shown how in various limits, PCNs can be found to approximate backpropagation (BP), recent work has demonstrated that PCNs operating in this standard regime, which does not approximate BP, nevertheless obtain competitive training and generalization performance to BP-trained networks while outperforming them on various tasks. However, little is understood theoretically about the properties and dynamics of PCNs in this regime. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive theoretical analysis of the properties of PCNs trained with prospective configuration. We first derive analytical results concerning the inference equilibrium for PCNs and a previously unknown close connection relationship to target propagation (TP). Secondly, we provide a theoretical analysis of learning in PCNs as a variant of generalized expectation-maximization and use that to prove the convergence of PCNs to critical points of the BP loss function, thus showing that deep PCNs can, in theory, achieve the same generalization performance as BP, while maintaining their unique advantages",

However, after a critical sample size \nP\n∗\n, we empirically find the finite-width network generalization becomes worse than that of the infinite width network. In this work, we empirically study the transition from infinite-width behavior to this \\textit{variance-limited} regime  as a function of sample size \nP\n and network width \nN\n. We find that finite-size effects can become relevant for very small dataset sizes on the order of \nP\n∗\n∼\nN\n for polynomial regression with ReLU networks. We discuss the source of these effects using an argument based on the variance of the NN's final neural tangent kernel (NTK). This transition can be pushed to larger \nP\n by enhancing feature learning or by ensemble averaging the networks. We find that the learning curve for regression with the final NTK is an accurate approximation of the NN learning curve. Using this, we provide  a toy model which also exhibits \nP\n∗\n∼\nN\n scaling and has \nP\n-dependent benefits from feature learning",

Traditional domain generalization or adaptation methods cannot directly work since there is no sufficient target domain distribution serving as the transfer object. The multi-source setting further prevents the transfer task as excessive domain gap introduced from all the source domains. To tackle this problem, we newly propose a progressive mix-up (P-Mixup) mechanism to introduce an intermediate mix-up domain, pushing both the source domains and the few-shot target domain aligned to this mix-up domain. Further by enforcing the mix-up domain to progressively move towards the source domains, we achieve the domain transfer from multi-source domains to the single one-shot target domain. Our P-Mixup is different from traditional mix-up that ours is with a progressive and adaptive mix-up ratio, following the curriculum learning spirit to better align the source and target domains. Moreover, our P-Mixup combines both pixel-level and feature-level mix-up to better enrich the data diversity. Experiments on two benchmarks show that our P-Mixup significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods, i.e., 6.0\\% and 6.8\\% improvements on Office-Home and DomainNet",

This is due to their ability to provide logical and interpretable explanations when used for predictions, as well as their ability to generalize to other tasks, domains, and data. While recent methods have been proposed to learn logical rules, the majority of these methods are either restricted by their computational complexity and can not handle the large search space of large-scale KGs, or show poor generalization when exposed to data outside the training set. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end neural model for learning compositional logical rules called NCRL. NCRL detects the best compositional structure of a rule body, and breaks it into small compositions in order to infer the rule head. By recurrently merging compositions in the rule body with a recurrent attention unit, NCRL finally predicts a single rule head. Experimental results show that NCRL learns high-quality rules, as well as being generalizable. Specifically, we show that NCRL is scalable, efficient, and yields state-of-the-art results for knowledge graph completion on large-scale KGs. Moreover, we test NCRL for systematic generalization by learning to reason on small-scale observed graphs and evaluating on larger unseen ones",

    "abstract": "Humans have been shown to use a ''straightened'' encoding to represent the natural visual world as it evolves in time (Henaff et al. 2019). In the context of discrete video sequences, ''straightened'' means that changes between frames follow a more linear path in representation space at progressively deeper levels of processing. While deep convolutional networks are often proposed as models of human visual processing, many do not straighten natural videos. In this paper, we explore the relationship between network architecture, differing types of robustness, biologically-inspired filtering mechanisms, and representational straightness in response to time-varying input; we identify strengths and limitations of straightness as a useful way of evaluating neural network representations. We find that (1) adversarial training leads to straighter representations in both CNN and transformer-based architectures but (2) this effect is task-dependent, not generalizing to tasks such as segmentation and frame-prediction, where straight representations are not favorable for predictions; and nor to other types of robustness. In addition, (3) straighter representations impart temporal stability to class predictions, even for out-of-distribution data. Finally, (4) biologically-inspired elements increase straightness in the early stages of a network, but do not guarantee increased straightness in downstream layers of CNNs. We show that straightness is an easily computed measure of representational robustness and stability, as well as a hallmark of human representations with benefits for computer vision models",

However, structured knowledge about the classes, such as hierarchical label structures, widely exists in many real-world datasets, e.g., the ImageNet and CIFAR benchmarks. How to learn representations that can preserve such structures among the classes remains an open problem. To approach this problem, given a tree of class hierarchy, we first define a tree metric between any pair of nodes in the tree to be the length of the shortest path connecting them. We then provide a method to learn the hierarchical relationship of class labels by approximately embedding the tree metric in the Euclidean space of features. More concretely, during supervised training, we propose to use the Cophenetic Correlation Coefficient (CPCC) as a regularizer for the cross-entropy loss to correlate the tree metric of classes and the Euclidean distance in the class-conditioned representations. Our proposed regularizer is computationally lightweight and easy to implement. Empirically, we demonstrate that this approach can help to learn more interpretable representations due to the preservation of the tree metric, and leads to better in-distribution generalization as well as under sub-population shifts over six real-world datasets",

Indeed, correctly sampled discrete images contain all information about the low spatial frequencies. The question is then how to extrapolate the spectrum in a data-driven way while meeting the above design criteria. Our answer is FunkNN---a novel convolutional network which learns how to reconstruct continuous images at arbitrary coordinates and can be applied to any image dataset. Combined with a discrete generative model it becomes a functional generator which can act as a prior in continuous ill-posed inverse problems. We show that FunkNN generates high-quality continuous images and exhibits strong out-of-distribution performance thanks to its patch-based design.

In this paper, we introduce a novel analysis of the classical label propagation algorithm (LPA) (Zhu & Ghahramani, 2002) that moreover takes advantage of useful prior information, specifically probabilistic hypothesized labels on the unlabeled data. We provide an error bound that exploits both the local geometric properties of the underlying graph and the quality of the prior information. We also propose a framework to incorporate multiple sources of noisy information. In particular, we consider the setting of weak supervision, where our sources of information are weak labelers. We demonstrate the ability of our approach on multiple benchmark weakly supervised classification tasks, showing improvements upon existing semi-supervised and weakly supervised methods",

Our method uses static analysis to construct dynamic contexts for each code element whose type signature is to be predicted by the model.

    "abstract": "Models trained via empirical risk minimization (ERM) are known to rely on spurious correlations between labels and task-independent input features, resulting in poor generalization to distributional shifts. Group distributionally robust optimization (G-DRO) can alleviate this problem by minimizing the worst-case loss over a set of pre-defined groups over training data. G-DRO successfully improves performance of the worst group, where the correlation does not hold. However, G-DRO assumes that the spurious correlations and associated worst groups are known in advance,  making it challenging to apply them to new tasks with potentially multiple unknown correlations. We propose AGRO---Adversarial Group discovery for Distributionally Robust Optimization---an end-to-end approach that jointly identifies error-prone groups and improves accuracy on them. AGRO equips G-DRO with an adversarial slicing model to find a group assignment for training examples which maximizes worst-case loss over the discovered groups. On the WILDS benchmark, AGRO results in 8\\% higher model performance on average on known worst-groups, compared to prior group discovery approaches used with G-DRO. AGRO also improves out-of-distribution performance on SST2, QQP, and MS-COCO---datasets where potential spurious correlations are as yet uncharacterized. Human evaluation of ARGO groups shows that they contain well-defined, yet previously unstudied spurious correlations that lead to model errors",

Unlike existing DP methods, (1) LogicDP utilizes the inductive logic programming (ILP) technique and automatically discovers the labeling functions from the graph data; (2) LogicDP employs a budget-aware framework to iteratively refine the functions by querying an oracle, which significantly reduces the human efforts in function creations.

To build a sample-efficient world model, we apply a transformer to real-world episodes in an autoregressive manner: not only the compact latent states and the taken actions but also the experienced or predicted rewards are fed into the transformer, so that it can attend flexibly to all three modalities at different time steps. The transformer allows our world model to access previous states directly, instead of viewing them through a compressed recurrent state. By utilizing the Transformer-XL architecture, it is able to learn long-term dependencies while staying computationally efficient. Our transformer-based world model (TWM) generates meaningful, new experience, which is used to train a policy that outperforms previous model-free and model-based reinforcement learning algorithms on the Atari 100k benchmark.

    "title": "Can Neural Networks Learn Implicit Logic from Physical Reasoning?",
    "abstract": "Despite the success of neural network models in a range of domains, it remains an open question whether they can learn to represent abstract logical operators such as negation and disjunction. We test the hypothesis that neural networks without inherent inductive biases for logical reasoning can acquire an implicit representation of negation and disjunction. Here, implicit refers to limited, domain-specific forms of these operators, and work in psychology suggests these operators may be a precursor (developmentally and evolutionarily) to the type of abstract, domain-general logic that is characteristic of adult humans. To test neural networks, we adapt a test designed to diagnose the presence of negation and disjunction in animals and pre-verbal children, which requires inferring the location of a hidden object using constraints of the physical environment as well as implicit logic: if a ball is hidden in A or B, and shown not to be in A, can the subject infer that it is in B? Our results show that, despite the neural networks learning to track objects behind occlusion, they are unable to generalize to a task that requires implicit logic. We further show that models are unable to generalize to the test task even when they are trained directly on a logically identical (though visually dissimilar) task. However, experiments using transfer learning reveal that the models do recognize structural similarity between tasks which invoke the same logical reasoning pattern, suggesting that some desirable abstractions are learned, even if they are not yet sufficient to pass established tests of logical reasoning",

    "abstract": "Recent techniques for approximating Nash equilibria in very large games leverage neural networks to learn approximately optimal policies (strategies). One promis- ing line of research uses neural networks to approximate counterfactual regret minimization (CFR) or its modern variants. DREAM, the only current CFR-based neural method that is model free and therefore scalable to very large games, trains a neural network on an estimated regret target that can have extremely high variance due to an importance sampling term inherited from Monte Carlo CFR (MCCFR). In this paper we propose an unbiased model-free method that does not require any importance sampling. Our method, ESCHER, is principled and is guaranteed to converge to an approximate Nash equilibrium with high probability. We show that the variance of the estimated regret of ESCHER is orders of magnitude lower than DREAM and other baselines. We then show that ESCHER outperforms the prior state of the art—DREAM and neural fictitious self play (NFSP)—on a number of games and the difference becomes dramatic as game size increases. In the very large game of dark chess, ESCHER is able to beat DREAM and NFSP in a head-to-head competition over 90% of the time",

    "abstract": "We consider a setting that a model needs to adapt to a new domain under distribution shifts, given that only unlabeled test samples from the new domain are accessible at test time. A common idea in most of the related works is constructing pseudo-labels for the unlabeled test samples and applying gradient descent (GD) to a loss function with the pseudo-labels. Recently, Goyal et al. (2022) propose conjugate labels, which is a new kind of pseudo-labels for self-training at test time. They empirically show that the conjugate label outperforms other ways of pseudo-labeling on many domain adaptation benchmarks. However, provably showing that GD with conjugate labels learns a good classifier for test-time adaptation remains open. In this work, we aim at theoretically understanding GD with hard and conjugate labels for a binary classification problem. We show that for square loss, GD with conjugate labels converges to an \nϵ\n-optimal predictor under a Gaussian model for any arbitrarily small \nϵ\n, while GD with hard pseudo-labels fails in this task. We also analyze them under different loss functions for the update. Our results shed lights on understanding when and why GD with hard labels or conjugate labels works in test-time adaptation",

These models leverage compositional architectures which aim to learn specialized modules dedicated to structures in a task that can be composed to solve novel problems with similar structures. While the compositionality of these architectures is guaranteed by design, the modules specializing is not. Here we theoretically study the ability of network modules to specialize to useful structures in a dataset and achieve systematic generalization. To this end we introduce a minimal space of datasets motivated by practical systematic generalization benchmarks. From this space of datasets we present a mathematical definition of systematicity and study the learning dynamics of linear neural modules when solving components of the task. Our results shed light on the difficulty of module specialization, what is required for modules to successfully specialize, and the necessity of modular architectures to achieve systematicity. Finally, we confirm that the theoretical results in our tractable setting generalize to more complex datasets and non-linear architectures",

    "abstract": "Knowledge distillation has been shown to be a powerful model compression approach to facilitate the deployment of pre-trained language models in practice. This paper focuses on task-agnostic distillation. It produces a compact pre-trained model that can be easily fine-tuned on various tasks with small computational costs and memory footprints. Despite the practical benefits, task-agnostic distillation is challenging. Since the teacher model has a significantly larger capacity and stronger representation power than the student model, it is very difficult for the student to produce predictions that match the teacher's over a massive amount of open-domain training data. Such a large prediction discrepancy often diminishes the benefits of knowledge distillation. To address this challenge, we propose Homotopic Distillation (HomoDistil), a novel task-agnostic distillation approach equipped with iterative pruning. Specifically, we initialize the student model from the teacher model, and iteratively prune the student's neurons until the target width is reached. Such an approach maintains a small discrepancy between the teacher's and student's predictions throughout the distillation process, which ensures the effectiveness of knowledge transfer. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HomoDistil achieves significant improvements on existing baselines. Our codes will be released",

However, for many complex tasks, a demonstration or language instruction alone contains ambiguities, preventing tasks from being specified clearly. In such cases, a combination of both a demonstration and an instruction more concisely and effectively conveys the task to the robot than either modality alone. To instantiate this problem setting, we train a single multi-task policy on a few hundred challenging robotic pick-and-place tasks and propose DeL-TaCo (Joint Demo-Language Task Conditioning), a method for conditioning a robotic policy on task embeddings comprised of two components: a visual demonstration and a language instruction. By allowing these two modalities to mutually disambiguate and clarify each other during novel task specification, DeL-TaCo (1) substantially decreases the teacher effort needed to specify a new task and (2) achieves better generalization performance on novel objects and instructions over previous task-conditioning methods. To our knowledge, this is the first work to show that simultaneously conditioning a multi-task robotic manipulation policy on both demonstration and language embeddings improves sample efficiency and generalization over conditioning on either modality alone",

Our approach leverages this proxy reward function in an RL framework. Specifically, users specify a prompt once at the beginning of training. During training, the LLM evaluates an RL agent's behavior against the desired behavior described by the prompt and outputs a corresponding reward signal. The RL agent then uses this reward to update its behavior. We evaluate whether our approach can train agents aligned with user objectives in the Ultimatum Game, matrix games, and the DealOrNoDeal negotiation task. In all three tasks, we show that RL agents trained with our framework are well-aligned with the user's objectives and outperforms RL agents trained with reward functions learned via supervised learning",

Previous research has shown that deep neural networks tend to be over-confident, and we find that sparse training exacerbates this problem. Therefore, calibrating the sparse models is crucial for reliable prediction and decision making. In this paper, we propose a new sparse training method to produce sparse models with improved confidence calibration. In contrast to previous research that uses only one mask to control the sparse topology, our method utilizes two masks, including a deterministic mask and a random mask. The former efficiently searches and activates important weights by exploiting the magnitude of weights and gradients. While the latter brings better exploration and finds more appropriate weight values by random updates. Theoretically, we prove our method can be viewed as a hierarchical variational approximation of a probabilistic deep Gaussian process. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets, model architectures, and sparsities show that our method can reduce ECE values by up to 47.8\\% and simultaneously maintain or even improve accuracy with only a slight increase in computational and storage burden",

One crucial stepping stone is to devise RL algorithms that are robust in the face of dropped information from corrupted communication or malfunctioning sensors. Typical RL methods usually require considerable online interaction data that are costly and unsafe to collect in the real world. Furthermore, when applying to the frame dropping scenarios, they perform unsatisfactorily even with moderate drop rates. To address these issues, we propose  Decision Transformer under Random Frame Dropping~(DeFog), an offline RL algorithm that enables agents to act robustly in frame dropping scenarios without online interaction. DeFog first randomly masks out data in the offline datasets and explicitly adds the time span of frame dropping as inputs. After that, a finetuning stage on the same offline dataset with a higher mask rate would further boost the performance. Empirical results show that DeFog outperforms strong baselines under severe frame drop rates like 90\\%, while maintaining similar returns under non-frame-dropping conditions in the regular MuJoCo control benchmarks and the Atari environments.

    "abstract": "We propose a new family of regularized Rényi divergences parametrized not only by the order \nα\n but also by a variational function space. These new objects are defined by taking the infimal convolution of the standard Rényi divergence with the integral probability metric (IPM) associated with the chosen function space. We derive a novel dual variational representation that can be used to construct numerically tractable divergence estimators. This representation avoids risk-sensitive terms and therefore exhibits lower variance, making it well-behaved  when \nα\n>\n1\n; this addresses a notable weakness of prior approaches. We prove several properties of these new divergences, showing that they interpolate between the classical Rényi divergences and IPMs. We also study the \nα\n→\n∞\n limit, which leads to a regularized worst-case-regret and a new variational representation in the classical case. Moreover, we show that the proposed regularized Rényi divergences inherit features from IPMs such as the ability to compare distributions that are not absolutely continuous, e.g., empirical measures and distributions with low-dimensional support. We present numerical results on both synthetic and real datasets, showing the utility of these new divergences in both estimation and GAN training applications; in particular, we demonstrate significantly reduced variance and improved training performance",

By conditioning on more than one retrieved memories, compositions of structures are predicted, that mix and match parts across the retrieved memories. One-shot, few-shot or many-shot learning are treated uniformly in Analogical Networks, by conditioning on the appropriate set of memories, whether taken from a single, few or many memory exemplars, and inferring analogous parses. We show Analogical Networks are competitive with state-of-the-art 3D segmentation transformer in many-shot settings and outperform them and existing paradigms of meta-learning and few-shot learning in few-shot scenarios.

We first demonstrate existing methods could experience up to 20\\% decrease in their AUCs in the near-distribution setting. Next, we propose to exploit a score-based generative model to produce synthetic near-distribution anomalous data. Our model is then fine-tuned to distinguish such data from the normal samples. We make quantitative as well as qualitative evaluation of this strategy, and compare the results with a variety of GAN-based models.  Effectiveness of our method for both near-distribution and standard novelty detection is assessed through extensive experiments on datasets in diverse applications such as medical images, object classification, and quality control.

    "abstract": "Super resolution (SR) is a promising approach for improving the quality of low resolution steaming services on mobile devices.\nOn mobile devices, the available computing and memory resources change dynamically depending on other running applications.\nDue to the high computation and memory demands of SR models, it is essential to adapt the model according to available resources to harvest the best possible model performance while maintaining quality of service (QoS), such as meeting a minimum framerate and avoiding interruptions.  Nevertheless, there is no SR model or machine learning system that supports adaptive SR, and enabling adaptive SR model on mobile devices is challenging because adapting model can cause significant framerate drop or even service interruption. To address this challenge, we take an algorithm and system co-design approach and propose DySR that maintains QoS while maximizing the model performance.  During the training stage, DySR employs an adaption-aware one-shot Neural Architecture Search to produce sub-graphs that share kernel operation weights for low model adaption overhead while striking a balance between performance and framerate. During the inference stage, an incremental model adaption method is developed for further reducing the model adaption overhead. We evaluate on a diverse set of hardware and datasets to show that DySR can generate models close to the Pareto frontier while maintaining a steady framerate throughput with a memory footprint of around 40\\% less compared to baseline methods",

This property allows us to bound the second-order path lengths of the learning dynamics. Second, we prove a tighter algebraic inequality regarding the weights deployed by OFTRL that shaves an extra \nlog\n⁡\nT\n factor.

    "title": "Hyper-Decision Transformer for Efficient Online Policy Adaptation",
    "abstract": "Decision Transformers (DT) have demonstrated strong performances in offline reinforcement learning settings, but quickly adapting to unseen novel tasks remains challenging. To address this challenge, we propose a new framework, called Hyper-Decision Transformer (HDT), that can generalize to novel tasks from a handful of demonstrations in a data- and parameter-efficient manner. To achieve such a goal, we propose to augment the base DT with an adaptation module, whose parameters are initialized by a hyper-network. When encountering unseen tasks, the hyper-network takes a handful of demonstrations as inputs and initializes the adaptation module accordingly. This initialization enables HDT to efficiently adapt to novel tasks by only fine-tuning the adaptation module. We validate HDT's generalization capability on object manipulation tasks. We find that with a single expert demonstration and fine-tuning only 0.5% of DT parameters, HDT adapts faster to unseen tasks than fine-tuning the whole DT model. Finally, we explore a more challenging setting where expert actions are not available, and we show that HDT outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in terms of task success rates by a large margin.

However, most actor-critic methods come at the cost of added complexity: heuristics for stabilisation, compute requirements and wider hyperparameter search spaces. We show that a simple modification of deep Q-learning largely alleviates these issues. By combining bang-bang action discretization with value decomposition, framing single-agent control as cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), this simple critic-only approach matches performance of state-of-the-art continuous actor-critic methods when learning from features or pixels. We extend classical bandit examples from cooperative MARL to provide intuition for how decoupled critics leverage state information to coordinate joint optimization, and demonstrate surprisingly strong performance across a variety of continuous control tasks",

Formally, two-team zero-sum games are defined as multi-player games where players are split into two competing sets of agents, each experiencing a utility identical to that of their teammates and opposite to that of the opposing team. We focus on the solution concept of Nash equilibria and prove \nCLS\n-hardness of computing them in this class of games. To further examine the capabilities of online learning algorithms in games with full-information feedback, we propose a benchmark of a simple ---yet nontrivial--- family of such games. These games do not enjoy the properties used to prove convergence for relevant algorithms. In particular, we use a dynamical systems perspective to demonstrate that gradient descent-ascent, its optimistic variant, optimistic multiplicative weights update, and extra gradient fail to converge (even locally) to a Nash equilibrium. On a brighter note, we propose a first-order method that leverages control theory techniques and under some conditions enjoys last-iterate local convergence to a Nash equilibrium. We also believe our proposed method is of independent interest for general min-max optimization",

Despite the powerful expressiveness of the popular recurrent neural network (RNN) models for point process data, they may not successfully capture sophisticated non-stationary dependencies in the data due to their recurrent structures. Another popular type of deep model for point process data is based on representing the influence kernel (rather than the intensity function) by neural networks. We take the latter approach and develop a new deep non-stationary influence kernel that can model non-stationary spatio-temporal point processes. The main idea is to approximate the influence kernel with a novel and general low-rank decomposition, enabling efficient representation through deep neural networks and computational efficiency and better performance. We also take a new approach to maintain the non-negativity constraint of the conditional intensity by introducing a log-barrier penalty.

    "abstract": "Active learning has demonstrated data efficiency in many fields. Existing active learning algorithms, especially in the context of batch-mode deep Bayesian active models, rely heavily on the quality of uncertainty estimations of the model, and are often challenging to scale to large batches. In this paper, we propose Batch-BALanCe, a scalable batch-mode active learning algorithm, which combines insights from decision-theoretic active learning, combinatorial information measure, and diversity sampling. At its core, Batch-BALanCe relies on a novel decision-theoretic acquisition function that facilitates differentiation among different equivalence classes. Intuitively, each equivalence class consists of hypotheses (e.g., posterior samples of deep neural networks) with similar predictions, and Batch-BALanCe adaptively adjusts the size of the equivalence classes as learning progresses. To scale up the computation of queries to large batches, we further propose an efficient batch-mode acquisition procedure, which aims to maximize a novel combinatorial information measure defined through the acquisition function. We show that our algorithm can effectively handle realistic multi-class classification tasks, and achieves compelling performance on several benchmark datasets for active learning under both low- and large-batch regimes",

Several works have focused on altering the reconstruction term of the evidence lower bound (ELBO), however, often at the expense of losing the mathematical link to maximizing the likelihood of the samples under the modeled distribution. Here we propose a new formulation of the reconstruction term for the VAE that specifically penalizes the generation of blurry images while at the same time still maximizing the ELBO under the modeled distribution.  \nWe show the potential of the proposed loss on three different data sets, where it outperforms several recently proposed reconstruction losses for VAEs",

However, neither real brains nor neuromorphic chips can perfectly follow the loss gradient, so parameter updates would necessarily use gradient estimators that have some variance and/or bias. Therefore, there is a need to understand better how variance and bias in gradient estimators impact learning dependent on network and task properties. Here, we show that variance and bias can impair learning on the training data, but some degree of variance and bias in a gradient estimator can be beneficial for generalization. We find that the ideal amount of variance and bias in a gradient estimator are dependent on several properties of the network and task: the size and activity sparsity of the network, the norm of the gradient, and the curvature of the loss landscape. As such, whether considering biologically-plausible learning algorithms or algorithms for training neuromorphic chips, researchers can analyze these properties to determine whether their approximation to gradient descent will be effective for learning given their network and task properties",

Contrary to the established practice of limiting the capacity of the readout model, we design a hybrid discrete and continuous-valued model space for the readout models and employ a switching strategy to combine their predictions. The MDL score takes model complexity, as well as data efficiency into account. As a result, the most appropriate model for the specific task and representation will be chosen, making it a unified measure for comparison. The proposed metric can be efficiently computed with an online method and we present results for pre-trained vision encoders of various architectures (ResNet and ViT) and objective functions (supervised and self-supervised) on a range of downstream tasks. We compare our methods with accuracy-based approaches and show that the latter are inconsistent when multiple readout models are used.

It can address inverse problems with noisy, non-linear, or even non-differentiable measurements, in contrast to many existing approaches that are limited to noiseless linear ones. We illustrate the empirical effectiveness of \nΠ\nGDM on several image restoration tasks, including super-resolution, inpainting and JPEG restoration. On ImageNet, \nΠ\nGDM is competitive with state-of-the-art diffusion models trained on specific tasks, and is the first to achieve this with problem-agnostic diffusion models. \nΠ\nGDM can also solve a wider set of inverse problems where the measurement processes are composed of several simpler ones",

    "abstract": "Recent works have shown that language modeling can be effectively used to train reinforcement learning (RL) policies. However, the success of applying existing language models to planning, in which we wish to obtain a trajectory of actions to reach some goal, is less straightforward. The typical autoregressive generation procedures of language models preclude sequential refinement of earlier steps, which limits the effectiveness of a predicted plan. In this paper, we suggest an approach towards integrating planning with language models based on the idea of iterative energy minimization, and illustrate how such a procedure leads to improved RL performance across different tasks. We train a masked language model to capture an implicit energy function over trajectories of actions, and formulate planning as finding a trajectory of actions with minimum energy. We illustrate how this procedure enables improved performance over recent approaches across BabyAI and Atari environments. We further demonstrate unique benefits of our iterative optimization procedure, involving new task generalization, test-time constraints adaptation, and the ability to compose plans together.

    "title": "Verifying the Union of Manifolds Hypothesis for Image Data",
    "abstract": "Deep learning has had tremendous success at learning low-dimensional representations of high-dimensional data. This success would be impossible if there was no hidden low-dimensional structure in data of interest; this existence is posited by the manifold hypothesis, which states that the data lies on an unknown manifold of low intrinsic dimension. In this paper, we argue that this hypothesis does not properly capture the low-dimensional structure typically present in image data. Assuming that data lies on a single manifold implies intrinsic dimension is identical across the entire data space, and does not allow for subregions of this space to have a different number of factors of variation. To address this deficiency, we consider the union of manifolds hypothesis, which states that data lies on a disjoint union of manifolds of varying intrinsic dimensions. We empirically verify this hypothesis on commonly-used image datasets, finding that indeed, observed data lies on a disconnected set and that intrinsic dimension is not constant. We also provide insights into the implications of the union of manifolds hypothesis in deep learning, both supervised and unsupervised, showing that designing models with an inductive bias for this structure improves performance across classification and generative modelling tasks.

We demonstrate the existence of this failure mode across multiple networks trained across RotatedMNIST, PACS, TerraIncognita, DomainNet and ImageNet-R datasets.

Finally, we show that such nullspace behavior also provides an insight into neural networks trained on poisoned data.

    "title": "ContraNorm: A Contrastive Learning Perspective on Oversmoothing and Beyond",
    "abstract": "Oversmoothing is a common phenomenon in a wide range of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and Transformers, where performance degenerates as the layer goes deeper. Instead of characterizing oversmoothing from the view of complete collapse in which representations converge to a single point, we dive into a more general perspective dimensional collapse in which representations lie in a narrow cone. Accordingly, inspired by the power of contrastive learning in preventing dimensional collapse, we propose a novel normalization layer ContraNorm. Intuitively, ContraNorm implicitly shatters representations in the embedding space, leading to a more uniform distribution and slighter dimensional collapse. On the theoretical analysis, we prove that ContraNorm can alleviate both complete collapse and dimensional collapse under some conditions. Our proposed normalization layer can be easily inserted into GNNs and Transformers with negligible parameter overhead. Experiments on various real-world datasets verify the effectiveness of our method",

HiP-MDP is a natural model for families of tasks in which meta- and lifelong-reinforcement learning approaches can succeed. Given a learned context encoder that infers the hidden parameters from previous experience, most existing algorithms fall into two categories: \nmodel transfer\n and \npolicy transfer\n, depending on which function the hidden parameters are used to parameterize. We characterize the robustness of model and policy transfer algorithms with respect to hidden parameter estimation error. We first show that the value function of HiP-MDPs is Lipschitz continuous under certain conditions. We then derive regret bounds for both settings through the lens of Lipschitz continuity.

    "abstract": "In this work, we aim to learn dexterous manipulation of deformable objects using multi-fingered hands. Reinforcement learning approaches for dexterous rigid object manipulation would struggle in this setting due to the complexity of physics interaction with deformable objects. At the same time, previous trajectory optimization approaches with differentiable physics for deformable manipulation would suffer from local optima caused by the explosion of contact modes from hand-object interactions. To address these challenges, we propose DexDeform, a principled framework that abstracts dexterous manipulation skills from human demonstration, and refines the learned skills with differentiable physics. Concretely, we first collect a small set of human demonstrations using teleoperation. And we then train a skill model using demonstrations for planning over action abstractions in imagination. To explore the goal space, we further apply augmentations to the existing deformable shapes in demonstrations and use a gradient optimizer to refine the actions planned by the skill model. Finally, we adopt the refined trajectories as new demonstrations for finetuning the skill model. To evaluate the effectiveness of our approach, we introduce a suite of six challenging dexterous deformable object manipulation tasks. Compared with baselines, DexDeform is able to better explore and generalize across novel goals unseen in the initial human demonstrations.

Passive attacks are one of the hardest-to-detect attacks, since they can be performed without modifying how the behavior of the central server or its clients, and assumes *no access to private data instances*. The key insight of our method is empirically observing that, near parameters that generalize well in test, the gradient of large overparameterized neural network models statistically behave like high-dimensional independent isotropic random vectors.  Using this insight, we devise two attacks that are often little impacted by existing and proposed defenses. Finally, we validated the hypothesis that our attack depends on the overparametrization by showing that increasing the level of overparametrization (without changing the neural network architecture) positively correlates with our attack effectiveness",

    "abstract": "We present a bi-encoder framework for named entity recognition (NER), which applies contrastive learning to map candidate text spans and entity types into the same vector representation space. Prior work predominantly approaches NER as sequence labeling or span classification. We instead frame NER as a representation learning problem that maximizes the similarity between the vector representations of an entity mention and its type. This makes it easy to handle nested and flat NER alike, and can better leverage noisy self-supervision signals. A major challenge to this bi-encoder formulation for NER lies in separating non-entity spans from entity mentions. Instead of explicitly labeling all non-entity spans as the same class \nOutside\n (\nO\n) as in most prior methods, we introduce a novel dynamic thresholding loss, learned in conjunction with the standard contrastive loss. Experiments show that our method performs well in both supervised and distantly supervised settings, for nested and flat NER alike, establishing new state of the art across standard datasets in the general domain (e.g., ACE2004, ACE2005, CoNLL2003) and high-value verticals such as biomedicine (e.g., GENIA, NCBI, BC5CDR, JNLPBA).

    "abstract": "Learning from large amounts of unsupervised data and a small amount of supervision is an important open problem in computer vision. We propose a new semi-supervised learning method, Semantic Positives via Pseudo-Labels (SEMPPL), that combines labelled and unlabelled data to learn informative representations. Our method extends self-supervised contrastive learning—where representations are shaped by distinguishing whether two samples represent the same underlying datum (positives) or not (negatives)—with a novel approach to selecting  positives. To enrich the set of positives, we leverage the few existing ground-truth labels to predict the missing  ones through a k-nearest neighbors classifier by using the learned embeddings of the labelled data. We thus extend the set of positives with datapoints having the same pseudo-label and call these semantic positives. We jointly learn the representation and predict bootstrapped pseudo-labels. This creates a reinforcing cycle. Strong initial representations enable better pseudo-label predictions which then improve the selection of semantic positives and lead to even better representations. SEMPPL outperforms competing semi-supervised methods setting new state-of-the-art performance of 76% and 68.5% top-1accuracy when using a ResNet-50 and training on 10% and 1% of labels on ImageNet, respectively. Furthermore, when using selective kernels, SEMPPL significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art achieving 72.3% and 78.3% top-1accuracy on ImageNet with 1% and 10% labels, respectively, which improves absolute +7.8% and +6.2% over previous work. SEMPPL also exhibits state-of-the-art performance over larger ResNet models as well as strong robustness, out-of-distribution and transfer performance.

    "abstract": "Multiple instance learning (MIL) is a popular weakly-supervised learning model on the whole slide image (WSI) for AI-assisted pathology diagnosis. The recent advance in attention-based MIL allows the model to find its region-of-interest (ROI) for interpretation by learning the attention weights for image patches of WSI slides. However, we empirically find that the interpretability of some related methods is either untrustworthy as the principle of MIL is violated or unsatisfactory as the high-attention regions are not consistent with experts' annotations. In this paper, we propose Bayes-MIL to address the problem from a probabilistic perspective. The induced patch-level uncertainty is proposed as a new measure of MIL interpretability, which outperforms previous methods in matching doctors annotations. We design a slide-dependent patch regularizer (SDPR) for the attention, imposing constraints derived from the MIL assumption, on the attention distribution. SDPR explicitly constrains the model to generate correct attention values. The spatial information is further encoded by an approximate convolutional conditional random field (CRF), for better interpretability. Experimental results show Bayes-MIL outperforms the related methods in patch-level and slide-level metrics and provides much better interpretable ROI on several large-scale WSI datasets",

Low precision representations, achieved via quantization of weights and activations, can reduce inference time and memory requirements.

Understanding which groups of parameters and activations are more sensitive to quantization than others is a critical stage in maximizing efficiency. For this purpose, we propose FIT. Motivated by an information geometric perspective, FIT combines the Fisher information with a model of quantization. We find that FIT can estimate the final performance of a network without retraining. FIT effectively fuses contributions from both parameter and activation quantization into a single metric. Additionally, FIT is fast to compute when compared to existing methods, demonstrating favourable convergence properties.

In this work we propose a new compression-aware minimizer dubbed CrAM that modifies the optimization step in a principled way, in order to produce models whose local loss behavior is stable under compression operations such as pruning. Thus, dense models trained via CrAM should be compressible post-training, in a single step, without significant accuracy loss. Experimental results on standard benchmarks, such as residual networks for ImageNet classification and BERT models for language modelling, show that CrAM produces dense models that can be more accurate than the standard SGD/Adam-based baselines, but which are stable under weight pruning: specifically, we can prune models in one-shot to 70-80% sparsity with almost no accuracy loss, and to 90% with reasonable (∼ 1%) accuracy loss, which is competitive with gradual compression methods. Additionally, CrAM can produce sparse models which perform well for transfer learning, and it also works for semi-structured 2:4 pruning patterns supported by GPU hardware.

A common practice in meta-learning is to perform a train-validation split on each task, where the training set is used for adapting the model parameter to that specific task and the validation set is used for learning a prior model that is shared across all tasks. Despite its success and popularity in multitask learning and few-shot learning, the understanding of the train-validation split is still limited, especially when the neural network models are used. In this paper, we study the benefit of train-validation split for classification problems with neural network models trained by gradient descent. We prove that the train-validation split is necessary to learn a good prior model when the noise in the training sample is large, while the train-train method fails. We validate our theory by conducting experiment on both synthetic and real datasets.

    "abstract": "There is a growing interest in the machine learning community in developing predictive algorithms that are interpretable by design. To this end, recent work proposes to sequentially ask interpretable queries about data until a high confidence prediction can be made based on the answers obtained (the history). To promote short query-answer chains, a greedy procedure called Information Pursuit (IP) is used, which adaptively chooses queries in order of information gain. Generative models are employed to learn the distribution of query-answers and labels, which is in turn used to estimate the most informative query. However, learning and inference with a full generative model of the data is often intractable for complex tasks. In this work, we propose Variational Information Pursuit (V-IP), a variational characterization of IP which bypasses the need to learn generative models. V-IP is based on finding a query selection strategy and a classifier that minimize the expected cross-entropy between true and predicted labels. We prove that the IP strategy is the optimal solution to this problem. Therefore, instead of learning generative models, we can use our optimal strategy to directly pick the most informative query given any history. We then develop a practical algorithm by defining a finite-dimensional parameterization of our strategy and classifier using deep networks and train them end-to-end using our objective. Empirically, V-IP is 10-100x faster than IP on different Vision and NLP tasks with competitive performance. Moreover, V-IP finds much shorter query chains when compared to reinforcement learning which is typically used in sequential-decision-making problems. Finally, we demonstrate the utility of V-IP on challenging tasks like medical diagnosis where the performance is far superior to the generative modeling approach",

Although more efficient in terms of quality and computation cost, sparse models remain data-hungry and costly to train from scratch in the large scale regime. In this work, we propose sparse upcycling -- a simple way to reuse sunk training costs by initializing a sparsely activated Mixture-of-Experts model from a dense checkpoint. We show that sparsely upcycled T5 Base, Large, and XL language models and Vision Transformer Base and Large models, respectively, significantly outperform their dense counterparts on SuperGLUE and ImageNet, using only ~50% of the initial dense pretraining sunk cost.

    "abstract": "Recent works have shown that large models pretrained on common visual learning tasks can provide useful representations for a wide range of specialized perception problems, as well as a variety of robotic manipulation tasks.  While prior work on robotic manipulation has predominantly used frozen pretrained features, we demonstrate that in robotics this approach can fail to reach optimal performance, and that fine-tuning of the full model can lead to significantly better results. Unfortunately, fine-tuning disrupts the pretrained visual representation, and causes representational drift towards the fine-tuned task thus leading to a loss of the versatility of the original model. We introduce a method for lossless adaptation to address this shortcoming of classical fine-tuning. We demonstrate that appropriate placement of our parameter efficient adapters can significantly reduce the performance gap between frozen pretrained representations and full end-to-end fine-tuning without changes to the original representation and thus preserving original capabilities of the pretrained model. We perform a comprehensive investigation across three major model architectures (ViTs, NFNets, and ResNets), supervised (ImageNet-1K classification) and self-supervised pretrained weights (CLIP, BYOL, Visual MAE) in three manipulation task domains and 35 individual tasks, and demonstrate that our claims are strongly validated in various settings.

    "title": "Logical Message Passing Networks with One-hop Inference on Atomic Formulas",
    "abstract": "Complex Query Answering (CQA) over Knowledge Graphs (KGs) has attracted a lot of attention to potentially support many applications. Given that KGs are usually incomplete, neural models are proposed to answer the logical queries by parameterizing set operators with complex neural networks. However, such methods usually train neural set operators with a large number of entity and relation embeddings from the zero, where whether and how the embeddings or the neural set operators contribute to the performance remains not clear. In this paper, we propose a simple framework for complex query answering that decomposes the KG embeddings from neural set operators. We propose to represent the complex queries into the query graph. On top of the query graph, we propose the Logical Message Passing Neural Network (LMPNN) that connects the local one-hop inferences on atomic formulas to the global logical reasoning for complex query answering. We leverage existing effective KG embeddings to conduct one-hop inferences on atomic formulas, the results of which are regarded as the messages passed in LMPNN. The reasoning process over the overall logical formulas is turned into the forward pass of LMPNN that incrementally aggregates local information to finally predict the answers' embeddings. The complex logical inference across different types of queries will then be learned from training examples based on the LMPNN architecture. Theoretically, our query-graph represenation is more general than the prevailing operator-tree formulation, so our approach applies to a broader range of complex KG queries. Empirically, our approach yields the new state-of-the-art neural CQA model. Our research bridges the gap between complex KG query answering tasks and the long-standing achievements of knowledge graph representation learning.

    "abstract": "Identifying near duplicates within large, noisy text corpora has a myriad of applications that range from de-duplicating training datasets, reducing privacy risk, and evaluating test set leakage, to identifying reproduced news articles and literature within large corpora. Across these diverse applications, the overwhelming majority of work relies on \nN\n-grams. Limited efforts have been made to evaluate how well \nN\n-gram methods perform, in part because it is unclear how one could create an unbiased evaluation dataset for a massive corpus. This study uses the unique timeliness of historical news wires to create a 27,210 document dataset, with 122,876 positive duplicate pairs, for studying noise-robust de-duplication. The time-sensitivity of news makes comprehensive hand labelling feasible - despite the massive overall size of the corpus - as duplicates occur within a narrow date range. The study then develops and evaluates a range of de-duplication methods: hashing and \nN\n-gram overlap (which predominate in the literature), a contrastively trained bi-encoder, and a ``re-rank'' style approach combining a bi- and cross-encoder. The neural approaches significantly outperform hashing and \nN\n-gram overlap. We show that the bi-encoder scales well, de-duplicating a 10 million article corpus on a single GPU card in a matter of hours. We also apply our pre-trained model to the RealNews and patent portions of C4 (Colossal Clean Crawled Corpus), illustrating that a neural approach can identify many near duplicates missed by hashing, in the presence of various types of noise. The public release of our NEWS-COPY de-duplication dataset, codebase, and the pre-trained models will facilitate further research and applications",

    "title": "Few-shot Backdoor Attacks via Neural Tangent Kernels",
    "abstract": "In a backdoor attack, an attacker injects corrupted examples into the training set. The goal of the attacker is to cause the final trained model to predict the attacker's desired target label when a predefined trigger is added to test inputs. Central to these attacks is the trade-off between the success rate of the attack and the number of corrupted training examples injected. We pose this attack as a novel bilevel optimization problem: construct strong poison examples that maximize the attack success rate of the trained model. We use neural tangent kernels to approximate the training dynamics of the model being attacked and automatically learn strong poison examples. We experiment on subclasses of CIFAR-10 and ImageNet with WideResNet-34 and ConvNeXt architectures on periodic and patch trigger attacks and show that NTBA-designed poisoned examples achieve, for example, an attack success rate of  90% with ten times smaller number of poison examples injected compared to the baseline. We provided an interpretation of the NTBA-designed attacks using the analysis of kernel linear regression. We further demonstrate a vulnerability in overparametrized deep neural networks, which is revealed by the shape of the neural tangent kernel",

    "abstract": "Empirical studies of the loss landscape of deep networks have revealed that many local minima are connected through low-loss valleys. Yet, little is known about the theoretical origin of such valleys. We present a general framework for finding continuous symmetries in the parameter space, which carve out low-loss valleys. Our framework uses equivariances of the activation functions and can be applied to different layer architectures. To generalize this framework to nonlinear neural networks, we introduce a novel set of nonlinear, data-dependent symmetries. These symmetries can transform a trained model such that it performs similarly on new samples, which allows ensemble building that improves robustness under certain adversarial attacks. We then show that conserved quantities associated with linear symmetries can be used to define coordinates along low-loss valleys. The conserved quantities help reveal that using common initialization methods, gradient flow only explores a small part of the global minimum. By relating conserved quantities to convergence rate and sharpness of the minimum, we provide insights on how initialization impacts convergence and generalizability",

    "abstract": "Existing large language model-based code generation pipelines typically use beam search or sampling algorithms during the decoding process. Although the programs they generate achieve high token-matching-based scores, they often fail to compile or generate incorrect outputs. The main reason is that conventional Transformer decoding algorithms may not be the best choice for code generation. In this work, we propose a novel Transformer decoding algorithm, Planning-Guided Transformer Decoding (PG-TD), that uses a planning algorithm to do lookahead search and guide the Transformer to generate better programs. Specifically, instead of simply optimizing the likelihood of the generated sequences, the Transformer makes use of a planner that generates candidate programs and tests them on public test cases. The Transformer can therefore make more informed decisions and generate tokens that will eventually lead to higher-quality programs. We also design a mechanism that shares information between the Transformer and the planner to make our algorithm computationally efficient. We empirically evaluate our framework with several large language models as backbones on public coding challenge benchmarks, showing that 1) it can generate programs that consistently achieve higher performance compared with competing baseline methods; 2) it enables controllable code generation, such as concise codes and highly-commented codes by optimizing modified objective",

    "abstract": "Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) is a popular method in sampling. While there are quite a few works of studying this method on various aspects, an interesting question is how to choose its integration time to achieve acceleration. In this work, we consider accelerating the process of sampling from a distribution \nπ\n(\nx\n)\n∝\nexp\n⁡\n(\n−\nf\n(\nx\n)\n)\n via HMC via time-varying integration time. When the potential \nf\n is \nL\n-smooth and \nm\n-strongly convex, i.e. for sampling from a log-smooth and strongly log-concave target distribution \nπ\n, it is known that under a constant integration time, the number of iterations that ideal HMC takes to get an \nϵ\n Wasserstein-2 distance to the target \nπ\n is \nO\n(\nκ\nlog\n⁡\n1\nϵ\n)\n, where \nκ\n:=\nL\nm\n is the condition number. We propose a scheme of time-varying integration time based on the roots of Chebyshev polynomials. We show that in the case of quadratic potential \nf\n, i.e. when the target \nπ\n is a Gaussian distribution, ideal HMC with this choice of integration time only takes \nO\n(\nκ\nlog\n⁡\n1\nϵ\n)\n number of iterations to reach Wasserstein-2 distance less than \nϵ\n; this improvement on the dependence on condition number is akin to acceleration in optimization. The design and analysis of HMC with the proposed integration time is built on the tools of Chebyshev polynomials. Experiments find the advantage of adopting our scheme of time-varying integration time even for sampling from distributions with smooth strongly convex potentials that are not quadratic",

In contrast, a sequential scheme that updates policies agent-by-agent provides another perspective and shows strong performance. However, sample inefficiency and lack of monotonic improvement guarantees for each agent are still the two significant challenges for the sequential scheme. In this paper, we propose the \\textbf{A}gent-by-\\textbf{a}gent \\textbf{P}olicy \\textbf{O}ptimization (A2PO) algorithm to improve the sample efficiency and retain the guarantees of monotonic improvement for each agent during training. We justify the tightness of the monotonic improvement bound compared with other trust region algorithms.

To evaluate A2PO, we conduct a comprehensive empirical study on four benchmarks: StarCraftII, Multi-agent MuJoCo, Multi-agent Particle Environment, and Google Research Football full game scenarios.

    "abstract": "Existing analysis of AdaGrad and other adaptive methods for smooth convex optimization is typically for functions with bounded domain diameter. In unconstrained problems, previous works guarantee an asymptotic convergence rate without an explicit constant factor that holds true for the entire function class. Furthermore, in the stochastic setting, only a modified version of AdaGrad, different from the one commonly used in practice, in which the latest gradient is not used to update the stepsize, has been analyzed. Our paper aims at bridging these gaps and developing a deeper understanding of AdaGrad and its variants in the standard setting of smooth convex functions as well as the more general setting of quasar convex functions. First, we demonstrate new techniques to explicitly bound the convergence rate of the vanilla AdaGrad for unconstrained problems in both deterministic and stochastic settings. Second, we propose a variant of AdaGrad for which we can show the convergence of the last iterate, instead of the average iterate. Finally, we give new accelerated adaptive algorithms and their convergence guarantee in the deterministic setting with explicit dependency on the problem parameters, improving upon the asymptotic rate shown in previous works",

Our resulting method SP2 uses Hessian-vector products to speed-up the convergence of SP. Furthermore, and rather uniquely among second-order methods, the design of SP2 in no way relies on positive definite Hessian matrices or convexity of the objective function. We show SP2 is competitive both in experiments and in theory. \nWe show SP2 is very competitive on matrix completion, non-convex test problems and logistic regression.

To this end, we propose the Hidden Temporal MDP (HiT-MDP) and prove that the option-induced HiT-MDP is homomorphic equivalent to the option-induced SMDP. A novel transformer-based framework is introduced to learn options' embedding vectors (rather than conventional option tuples) on HiT-MDPs. We then derive a stable and sample efficient option discovering method under the maximum-entropy policy gradient framework. Extensive experiments on challenging Mujoco environments demonstrate HiT-MDP's efficiency and effectiveness: under widely used configurations, HiT-MDP achieves competitive, if not better, performance compared to the state-of-the-art baselines on all finite horizon and transfer learning environments. Moreover, HiT-MDP significantly outperforms all baselines on infinite horizon environments while exhibiting smaller variance, faster convergence, and better interpretability.

    "abstract": "Fast and accurate adaptation of automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems using only text data in the target domain is a problem of long-standing practical relevance. Text-only adaptation was easy in traditional cascaded ASR systems with completely decoupled acoustic and language models. Recently, the RNNTransducer (RNN-T) has emerged as a default ASR model because of its high accuracy, low latency, and capability of supporting streaming input. However text-only adaptation of the RNN-T model is significantly more challenging due to its tight integration of acoustic and language models and end-to-end training. Existing recent approaches for text-only adaptation of RNN-Ts, either entail significant modification to the network or introduce high latency during decoding. We propose a new approach (TOLSTOI) that imputes speech representations internal to a baseline RNN-T, starting from text-only inputs, and performs in-situ adaptation that results in higher adaptation accuracy without any runtime overheads during decoding. Our imputation model is a function of the labeled data and trained parameters of the ASR model, and that we show, is more effective in controlling catastrophic forgetting compared to existing methods. We establish the effectiveness of TOLSTOI using three target domains and two ASR models of varying complexity. We yield up to 35% relative reduction in word error rate with text-only adaptation while forgetting the least compared to existing adaptation approaches. Our method is easy to implement and can be harnessed on existing RNN-T models without requiring ASR model training from scratch",

    "abstract": "Multimodal few-shot learning is challenging due to the large domain gap between vision and language modalities. Existing methods are trying to communicate visual concepts as prompts to frozen language models, but rely on hand-engineered task induction to reduce the hypothesis space. To make the whole process learnable, we introduce a multimodal meta-learning approach. Specifically, our approach decomposes the training of the model into a set of related multimodal few-shot tasks. We define a meta-mapper network, acting as a meta-learner, to efficiently bridge frozen large-scale vision and language models and leverage their already learned capacity. By updating the learnable parameters only of the meta-mapper, it learns to accrue shared meta-knowledge among these tasks. Thus, it can rapidly adapt to newly presented samples with only a few gradient updates. Importantly, it induces the task in a completely data-driven manner, with no need for a hand-engineered task induction. We evaluate our approach on recently proposed multimodal few-shot benchmarks, measuring how rapidly the model can bind novel visual concepts to words and answer visual questions by observing only a limited set of labeled examples. The experimental results show that our meta-learning approach outperforms the baseline across multiple datasets and various training settings while being computationally more efficient",

In order to more fully understand inherent design and performance tradeoffs and accelerate the development of new breeds of soft robots, a comprehensive virtual platform — with well-established tasks, environments, and evaluation metrics — is needed. In this work, we introduce SoftZoo, a soft robot co-design platform for locomotion in diverse environments. SoftZoo supports an extensive, naturally-inspired material set, including the ability to simulate environments such as flat ground, desert, wetland, clay, ice, snow, shallow water, and ocean. Further, it provides a variety of tasks relevant for soft robotics, including fast locomotion, agile turning, and path following, as well as differentiable design representations for morphology and control. Combined, these elements form a feature-rich platform for analysis and development of soft robot co-design algorithms. We benchmark prevalent representations and co-design algorithms, and shed light on 1) the interplay between environment, morphology, and behavior (2) the importance of design space representations 3) the ambiguity in muscle formation and controller synthesis and 4) the value of differentiable physics. We envision that SoftZoo will serve as a standard platform and template an approach toward the development of novel representations and algorithms for co-designing soft robots’ behavioral and morphological intelligence.

Motivated by this, we leverage boundary sensitivity to express how perturbations in parameters move the shape boundary. This allows us to interpret the effect of each learnable parameter and study achievable deformations. With this, we perform geometric editing: finding a parameter update that best approximates a globally prescribed deformation. Prescribing the deformation only locally allows the rest of the shape to change according to some prior, such as semantics or deformation rigidity. Our method is agnostic to the model and its training and updates the NN in-place. Furthermore, we show how boundary sensitivity helps to optimize and constrain objectives (such as surface area and volume), which are difficult to compute without first converting to another representation, such as a mesh",

    "abstract": "In distributed computing, slower nodes (stragglers) usually become a bottleneck. Gradient Coding (GC), introduced by Tandon et al., is an efficient technique that uses principles of error-correcting codes to distribute gradient computation in the presence of stragglers. In this paper, we consider the distributed computation of a sequence of gradients \n{\ng\n(\n1\n)\n,\ng\n(\n2\n)\n,\n…\n,\ng\n(\nJ\n)\n}\n, where processing of each gradient \ng\n(\nt\n)\n starts in round-\nt\n and finishes by round-\n(\nt\n+\nT\n)\n. Here \nT\n≥\n0\n denotes a delay parameter. For the GC scheme, coding is only across computing nodes and this results in a solution where \nT\n=\n0\n. On the other hand, having \nT\n>\n0\n allows for designing schemes which exploit the temporal dimension as well. In this work, we propose two schemes that demonstrate improved performance compared to GC. Our first scheme combines GC with selective repetition of previously unfinished tasks and achieves improved straggler mitigation. In our second scheme, which constitutes our main contribution, we apply GC  to a subset of the tasks and repetition for the remainder of the tasks. We then multiplex these two classes of tasks across workers and rounds in an adaptive manner, based on past straggler patterns. Using theoretical analysis, we demonstrate that our second scheme achieves significant reduction in the computational load. In our experiments, we study a practical setting of concurrently training multiple neural networks over an AWS Lambda cluster involving 256 worker nodes, where our framework naturally applies. We demonstrate that the latter scheme can yield a 16\\% improvement in runtime over the baseline GC scheme, in the presence of naturally occurring, non-simulated stragglers",

    "abstract": "This paper proposes a novel batch normalization strategy for test-time adaptation. Recent test-time adaptation methods heavily rely on the modified batch normalization, i.e., transductive batch normalization (TBN), which calculates the mean and the variance from the current test batch rather than using the running mean and variance obtained from the source data, i.e., conventional batch normalization (CBN). Adopting TBN that employs test batch statistics mitigates the performance degradation caused by the domain shift. However, re-estimating normalization statistics using test data depends on impractical assumptions that a test batch should be large enough and be drawn from i.i.d. stream, and we observed that the previous methods with TBN show critical performance drop without the assumptions. In this paper, we identify that CBN and TBN are in a trade-off relationship and present a new test-time normalization (TTN) method that interpolates the statistics by adjusting the importance between CBN and TBN according to the domain-shift sensitivity of each BN layer. Our proposed TTN improves model robustness to shifted domains across a wide range of batch sizes and in various realistic evaluation scenarios. TTN is widely applicable to other test-time adaptation methods that rely on updating model parameters via backpropagation. We demonstrate that adopting TTN further improves their performance and achieves state-of-the-art performance in various standard benchmarks",

    "abstract": "A grand goal in deep learning research is to learn representations capable of generalizing across distribution shifts.\nDisentanglement is one promising direction aimed at aligning a model's representation with the underlying factors generating the data (e.g. color or background). Existing disentanglement methods, however, rely on an often unrealistic assumption: that factors are statistically independent. In reality, factors (like object color and shape) are correlated. To address this limitation, we consider the use of a relaxed disentanglement criterion -- the Hausdorff Factorized Support (HFS) criterion -- that encourages only pairwise factorized support, rather than a factorial distribution, by minimizing a Hausdorff distance. This allows for arbitrary distributions of the factors over their support, including correlations between them. We show that the use of HFS consistently facilitates disentanglement and recovery of ground-truth factors across a variety of correlation settings and benchmarks, even under severe training correlations and correlation shifts, with in parts over +60% in relative improvement over existing disentanglement methods. In addition, we find that leveraging HFS for representation learning can even facilitate transfer to downstream tasks such as classification under distribution shifts. We hope our original approach and positive empirical results inspire further progress on the open problem of robust generalization.

    "title": "Interneurons accelerate learning dynamics in recurrent neural networks for statistical adaptation",
    "abstract": "Early sensory systems in the brain rapidly adapt to fluctuating input statistics, which requires recurrent communication between neurons. Mechanistically, such recurrent communication is often indirect and mediated by local interneurons. In this work, we explore the computational benefits of mediating recurrent communication via interneurons compared with direct recurrent connections. To this end, we consider two mathematically tractable recurrent neural networks that statistically whiten their inputs --- one with direct recurrent connections and the other with interneurons that mediate recurrent communication. By analyzing the corresponding continuous synaptic dynamics and numerically simulating the networks, we show that the network with interneurons is more robust to initialization than the network with direct recurrent connections in the sense that the convergence time for the synaptic dynamics in the network with interneurons (resp. direct recurrent connections) scales logarithmically (resp. linearly) with the spectrum of their initialization. Our results suggest that interneurons are computationally useful for rapid adaptation to changing input statistics. Interestingly, the network with interneurons is an overparameterized solution of the whitening objective for the network with direct recurrent connections, so our results can be viewed as a recurrent neural network analogue of the implicit acceleration phenomenon observed in overparameterized feedforward linear networks",

Such diffusion models allow for deterministic sampling via the probability flow ODE, giving rise to a latent space and an encoder map. While having important practical applications, such as the estimation of the likelihood, the theoretical properties of this map are not yet fully understood. In the present work, we partially address this question for the popular case of the VP-SDE (DDPM) approach. We show that, perhaps surprisingly, the DDPM encoder map coincides with the optimal transport map for common distributions; we support this claim by extensive numerical experiments using advanced tensor train solver for multidimensional Fokker-Planck equation.

Despite the recent success of molecular modeling with graph neural networks (GNNs), few models explicitly take rings in compounds into consideration, consequently limiting the expressiveness of the models. In this work, we design a new variant of GNN, ring-enhanced GNN (\nO\n-GNN), that explicitly models rings in addition to atoms and bonds in compounds. In \nO\n-GNN,  each ring is represented by a latent vector, which contributes to and is iteratively updated by atom and bond representations. Theoretical analysis shows that \nO\n-GNN is able to distinguish two isomorphic subgraphs lying on different rings using only one layer while conventional graph convolutional neural networks require multiple layers to distinguish, demonstrating that \nO\n-GNN is more expressive. Through experiments, \nO\n-GNN shows good performance on \n11\n public datasets. In particular, it achieves state-of-the-art validation result on the PCQM4Mv1 benchmark (outperforming the previous KDDCup champion solution) and the drug-drug interaction prediction task on DrugBank.

    "title": "MACTA: A Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning Approach for Cache Timing Attacks and Detection",
    "abstract": "Security vulnerabilities in computer systems raise serious concerns as computers process an unprecedented amount of private and sensitive data today. Cache timing attacks (CTA) pose an important practical threat as they can effectively breach many protection mechanisms in today’s systems. However, the current detection techniques for cache timing attacks heavily rely on heuristics and expert knowledge, which can lead to brittleness and the inability to adapt to new attacks. To mitigate the CTA threat, we propose MACTA, a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) approach that leverages population-based training to train both attackers and detectors. Following best practices, we develop a realistic simulated MARL environment, MA-AUTOCAT, which enables training and evaluation of cache-timing attackers and detectors. Our empirical results suggest that MACTA is an effective solution without any manual input from security experts. MACTA detectors can generalize to a heuristic attack not exposed in training with a 97.8% detection rate and reduce the attack bandwidth of adaptive attackers by 20% on average. In the meantime, MACTA attackers are qualitatively more effective than other attacks studied, and the average evasion rate of MACTA attackers against an unseen state-of-the-art detector can reach up to 99%. Furthermore, we found that agents equipped with a Transformer encoder can learn effective policies in situations when agents with multi-layer perceptron encoders do not in this environment, suggesting the potential of Transformer structures in CTA problems",

    "abstract": "In this paper we study online Reinforcement Learning (RL) in partially observable dynamical systems. We focus on the Predictive State Representations (PSRs) model, which is an expressive model that captures other well-known models such as Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDP). PSR represents the states using a set of predictions of future observations and is defined entirely using observable quantities. We develop a novel model-based algorithm for PSRs that can learn a near optimal policy in sample complexity scaling polynomially with respect to all the relevant parameters of the systems. Our algorithm naturally works with function approximation to extend to systems with potentially large state and observation spaces. We show that given a realizable model class, the sample complexity of learning the near optimal policy only scales polynomially with respect to the statistical complexity of the model class, without any explicit polynomial dependence on the size of the state and observation spaces. Notably, our work is the first work that shows polynomial sample complexities to compete with the globally optimal policy in PSRs. Finally, we demonstrate how our general theorem can be directly used to derive sample complexity bounds for special models including \nm\n-step weakly revealing and \nm\n-step decodable tabular POMDPs, POMDPs with low-rank latent transition, and POMDPs with linear emission and latent transition",

    "abstract": "We study decentralized policy learning in Markov games where we control a single agent to play with nonstationary and possibly adversarial opponents. Our goal is to develop a no-regret online learning algorithm that (i) takes actions based on the local information observed by the agent and (ii) is able to find the best policy in hindsight. For such a problem, the nonstationary state transitions due to the varying opponent pose a significant challenge. In light of a recent hardness result (Liu et al., 2022), we focus on the setting where the opponent's previous policies are revealed to the agent for decision making. With such an information structure, we propose a new algorithm, Decentralized Optimistic hypeRpolicy mIrror deScent (DORIS), which achieves \nK\n-regret in the context of general function approximation, where \nK\n is the number of episodes. Moreover, when all the agents adopt DORIS, we prove that their mixture policy constitutes an approximate coarse correlated equilibrium. In particular, DORIS maintains a hyperpolicy which is a distribution over the policy space. The hyperpolicy is updated via mirror descent, where the update direction is obtained by an optimistic variant of least-squares policy evaluation. Furthermore, to illustrate the power of our method, we apply DORIS to constrained and vector-valued MDPs, which can be formulated as zero-sum Markov games with a fictitious opponent",

However, evaluating the goodness of a schedule on the target hardware can be very time-consuming. Traditional approaches as well as previous machine learning ones typically optimize proxy metrics, which are fast to evaluate but can lead to bad schedules when tested on the target hardware. In this work, we propose a new approach to scheduling by sampling proportionally to the proxy metric using a novel GFlowNet method. We introduce a technique to control the trade-off between diversity and goodness of the proposed schedules at inference time and demonstrate empirically that the pure optimization baselines can lead to subpar performance with respect to our approach when tested on a target model. Furthermore, we show that conditioning the GFlowNet on the computation graph enables generalization to unseen scheduling problems for both synthetic and real-world compiler datasets",

    "title": "Autoregressive Conditional Neural Processes",
    "abstract": "Conditional neural processes (CNPs; Garnelo et al., 2018a) are attractive meta-learning models which produce well-calibrated predictions and are trainable via a simple maximum likelihood procedure. Although CNPs have many advantages, they are unable to model dependencies in their predictions. Various works propose solutions to this, but these come at the cost of either requiring approximate inference or being limited to Gaussian predictions. In this work, we instead propose to change how CNPs are deployed at test time, without any modifications to the model or training procedure. Instead of making predictions independently for every target point, we autoregressively define a joint predictive distribution using the chain rule of probability, taking inspiration from the neural autoregressive density estimator (NADE) literature. We show that this simple procedure allows factorised Gaussian CNPs to model highly dependent, non-Gaussian predictive distributions. Perhaps surprisingly, in an extensive range of tasks with synthetic and real data, we show that CNPs in autoregressive (AR) mode not only significantly outperform non-AR CNPs, but are also competitive with more sophisticated models that are significantly more computationally expensive and challenging to train. This performance is remarkable given that AR CNPs are not trained to model joint dependencies. Our work provides an example of how ideas from neural distribution estimation can benefit neural processes, and motivates research into the AR deployment of other neural process models",

In particular, we prove that commonly used self-supervised objectives based on reconstruction or contrastive samples can both recover useful posterior information for general topic models.

In contrast, modern overparameterized models can yield small test error despite interpolating noise — a phenomenon often called \"benign overfitting\" or \"harmless interpolation\". This paper argues that the degree to which interpolation is harmless hinges upon the strength of an estimator's inductive bias, i.e., how heavily the estimator favors solutions with a certain structure: while strong inductive biases prevent harmless interpolation, weak inductive biases can even require fitting noise to generalize well. Our main theoretical result establishes tight non-asymptotic bounds for high-dimensional kernel regression that reflect this phenomenon for convolutional kernels, where the filter size regulates the strength of the inductive bias. We further provide empirical evidence of the same behavior for deep neural networks with varying filter sizes and rotational invariance",

Our approach, DINOSAUR, significantly out-performs existing object-centric learning models on simulated data and is the first unsupervised object-centric model that scales to real world-datasets such as COCO and PASCAL VOC.

    "title": "Towards a Unified Theoretical Understanding of Non-contrastive Learning via Rank Differential Mechanism",
    "abstract": "Recently, a variety of methods under the name of non-contrastive learning (like BYOL, SimSiam, SwAV, DINO) show that when equipped with some asymmetric architectural designs, aligning positive pairs alone is sufficient to attain good performance in self-supervised visual learning. Despite some understandings of some specific modules (like the predictor in BYOL), there is yet no unified theoretical understanding of how these seemingly different asymmetric designs can all avoid feature collapse, particularly considering  methods that also work without the predictor (like DINO). In this work, we propose a unified theoretical understanding for existing variants of non-contrastive learning. Our theory named Rank Differential Mechanism (RDM) shows that all these asymmetric designs create a consistent rank difference in their dual-branch output features. This rank difference will provably lead to an improvement of effective dimensionality and alleviate either complete or dimensional feature collapse. Different from previous theories, our RDM theory is applicable to different asymmetric designs (with and without the predictor), and thus can serve as a unified understanding of existing non-contrastive learning methods. Besides, our RDM theory also provides practical guidelines for designing many new non-contrastive variants. We show that these variants indeed achieve comparable performance to existing methods on benchmark datasets, and some of them even outperform the baselines.

The framework allows the agent to execute task learning and morality learning adaptively. The agent selects trajectories from past experiences during task learning. Meanwhile, the trajectories are used to conduct self-imitation learning with a moral-enhanced objective. In order to achieve the trade-off between morality and task progress, the agent uses the combination of task policy and moral policy for action selection.

    "abstract": "Offline reinforcement learning (RL), which aims to learn an optimal policy using a previously collected static dataset, is an important paradigm of RL. Standard RL methods often perform poorly in this regime due to the function approximation errors on out-of-distribution actions. While a variety of regularization methods have been proposed to mitigate this issue, they are often constrained by policy classes with limited expressiveness that can lead to highly suboptimal solutions. In this paper, we propose representing the policy as a diffusion model, a recent class of highly-expressive deep generative models. We introduce Diffusion Q-learning (Diffusion-QL) that utilizes a conditional diffusion model to represent the policy. In our approach, we learn an action-value function and we add a term maximizing action-values into the training loss of the conditional diffusion model, which results in a loss that seeks optimal actions that are near the behavior policy. We show the expressiveness of the diffusion model-based policy, and the coupling of the behavior cloning and policy improvement under the diffusion model both contribute to the outstanding performance of Diffusion-QL. We illustrate the superiority of our method compared to prior works in a simple 2D bandit example with a multimodal behavior policy. We then show that our method can achieve state-of-the-art performance on the majority of the D4RL benchmark tasks",

    "abstract": "Cooperative multi-agent multi-armed bandits (CM2AB) study how distributed agents cooperatively play the same multi-armed bandit game. Most existing CM2AB works focused on maximizing the group performance of all agents---the accumulation of all agents' individual performance (i.e., individual reward). However, in many applications, the performance of the system is more sensitive to the ``bad'' agent---the agent with the worst individual performance. For example, in a drone swarm, a ``bad'' agent may crash into other drones and severely degrade the system performance. In that case, the key of the learning algorithm design is to coordinate computational and communicational resources among agents so to optimize the individual learning performance of the ``bad'' agent. In CM2AB, maximizing the group performance is equivalent to minimizing the group regret of all agents, and minimizing the individual performance can be measured by minimizing the maximum (worst) individual regret among agents. Minimizing the maximum individual regret was largely ignored in prior literature, and currently, there is little work on how to minimize this objective with a low communication overhead. In this paper, we propose a near-optimal algorithm on both individual and group regrets, in addition,  we also propose a novel communication module in the algorithm, which only needs \nO\n(\nlog\n⁡\n(\nlog\n⁡\nT\n)\n)\n communication times where \nT\n is the number of decision rounds.

    "abstract": "As machine learning (ML) models are increasingly being deployed in high-stakes applications, policymakers have suggested tighter data protection regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA). One key principle is the “right to be forgotten” which gives users the right to have their data deleted. Another key principle is the right to an actionable explanation, also known as algorithmic recourse, allowing users to reverse unfavorable decisions. To date, it is unknown whether these two principles can be operationalized simultaneously. Therefore, we introduce and study the problem of recourse invalidation in the context of data deletion requests. More specifically, we theoretically and empirically analyze the behavior of popular state-of-the-art algorithms and demonstrate that the recourses generated by these algorithms are likely to be invalidated if a small number of data deletion requests (e.g., 1 or 2) warrant updates of the predictive model. For the setting of differentiable models, we suggest a framework to identify a minimal subset of critical training points which, when removed, maximize the fraction of invalidated recourses.Using our framework, we empirically show that the removal of as little as 2 data instances from the training set can invalidate up to 95 percent of all recourses output by popular state-of-the-art algorithms. Thus, our work raises fundamental questions about the compatibility of ``the right to an actionable explanation'' in the context of the ``right to be forgotten'', while also providing constructive insights on the determining factors of recourse robustness",

    "title": "Learning What and Where: Disentangling Location and Identity Tracking Without Supervision",
    "abstract": "Our brain can almost effortlessly decompose visual data streams into background and salient objects. Moreover, it can anticipate object motion and interactions, which are crucial abilities for conceptual planning and reasoning. Recent object reasoning datasets, such as CATER, have revealed fundamental shortcomings of current vision-based AI systems, particularly when targeting explicit object representations, object permanence, and object reasoning. Here we introduce a self-supervised LOCation and Identity tracking system (Loci), which excels on the CATER tracking challenge. Inspired by the dorsal and ventral pathways in the brain, Loci tackles the binding problem by processing separate, slot-wise encodings of 'what' and 'where'. Loci's predictive coding-like processing encourages active error minimization, such that individual slots tend to encode individual objects. Interactions between objects and object dynamics are processed in the disentangled latent space. Truncated backpropagation through time combined with forward eligibility accumulation significantly speeds up learning and improves memory efficiency. Besides exhibiting superior performance in current benchmarks, Loci effectively extracts objects from video streams and separates them into location and Gestalt components. We believe that this separation offers a representation that will facilitate effective planning and reasoning on conceptual levels",

    "title": "BALTO: fast tensor program optimization with diversity-based active learning",
    "abstract": "Tensor program optimization (TPO) based on pre-trained models can effectively reduce the computing time of deep neural networks. However, training of such models is prohibitively expensive, which highly depends on a large-scale dataset and thus requires tremendous time-consuming performance measurements (more than 1 million) on target platforms. In this paper, we propose BALTO, a fast TPO approach with biased-diversity-based active learning, aiming at reducing much lower training costs under similar optimization accuracy.The key insight is that random sampling of existing approaches suffers from a heavy redundancy of low-performance programs, which incurs tremendous duplicated time-consuming measurements. Inspired by this, BALTO removes such redundancy by introducing active learning (AL) to TPO for a much lower training cost. However, applying AL with a brute-force way in BALTO can lead to an overestimation problem. To address this, we further propose a biased-diversity-based diversity scheme specially designed for BALTO. We compare BALTO against TenSet on \n6\n typical hardware platforms over \n2\n learning models. Experimental results show that, on average, BALTO only requires 5% of the total performance measurements of TenSet to achieve the same or higher model accuracy. Moreover, the optimized tensor programs even outperform that of TenSet by 1.06% due to higher model accuracy",

More specifically, we propose a normalizing flow-based autoencoder for an efficient and tractable representation of normal medical images. The anomaly score consists of the likelihood originated from the normalizing  flow  and the reconstruction error of the autoencoder, which allows to identify the abnormality and provide an interpretability at both image and pixel levels.

    "abstract": "The robustness of machine learning algorithms to distributions shift is primarily discussed in the context of supervised learning (SL). As such, there is a lack of insight on the robustness of the representations learned from unsupervised methods, such as self-supervised learning (SSL) and auto-encoder based algorithms (AE), to distribution shift. We posit that the input-driven objectives of unsupervised algorithms lead to representations that are more robust to distribution shift than the target-driven objective of SL. We verify this by extensively evaluating the performance of SSL and AE on both synthetic and realistic distribution shift datasets. Following observations that the linear layer used for classification itself can be susceptible to spurious correlations, we evaluate the representations using a linear\nhead trained on a small amount of out-of-distribution (OOD) data, to isolate the robustness of the learned representations from that of the linear head. We also develop “controllable” versions of existing realistic domain generalisation datasets with adjustable degrees of distribution shifts. This allows us to study the robustness of different learning algorithms under versatile yet realistic distribution shift\nconditions. Our experiments show that representations learned from unsupervised learning algorithms generalise better than SL under a wide variety of extreme as well as realistic distribution shifts",

    "abstract": "Fast and accurate predictions for complex physical dynamics are a big challenge across various applications. Real-time prediction on resource-constrained hardware is even more crucial in the real-world problems. The deep operator network (DeepONet) has recently been proposed as a framework for learning nonlinear mappings between function spaces. However, the DeepONet requires many parameters and has a high computational cost when learning operators, particularly those with complex (discontinuous or non-smooth) target functions. In this study, we propose HyperDeepONet, which uses the expressive power of the hypernetwork to enable learning of a complex operator with smaller set of parameters. The DeepONet and its variant models can be thought of as a method of injecting the input function information into the target function. From this perspective, these models can be viewed as a special case of HyperDeepONet. We analyze the complexity of DeepONet and conclude that HyperDeepONet needs relatively lower complexity to obtain the desired accuracy for operator learning. HyperDeepONet was successfully applied to various operator learning problems using low computational resources compared to other benchmarks",

    "abstract": "Federated Learning (FL) is a setting for training machine learning models in distributed environments where the clients do not share their raw data but instead send model updates to a server. However, model updates can be subject to attacks and leak private information. Differential Privacy (DP) is a leading mitigation strategy which involves adding noise to clipped model updates, trading off performance for strong theoretical privacy guarantees. Previous work has shown that the threat model of DP is conservative and that the obtained guarantees may be vacuous or may overestimate information leakage in practice. In this paper, we aim to achieve a tighter measurement of the model exposure by considering a realistic threat model. We propose a novel method, CANIFE, that uses canaries - carefully crafted samples by a strong adversary to evaluate the empirical privacy of a training round. We apply this attack to vision models trained on CIFAR-10 and CelebA and to language models trained on Sent140 and Shakespeare. In particular, in realistic FL scenarios, we demonstrate that the empirical per-round epsilon obtained with CANIFE is 4 -- 5\n×\n lower than the theoretical bound",

While its effectiveness is not yet fully understood, a line of recent work reveals that contrastive learning can invert the data generating process and recover ground truth latent factors shared between views. In this work, we present new identifiability results for multimodal contrastive learning, showing that it is possible to recover shared factors in a more general setup than the multi-view setting studied previously. Specifically, we distinguish between the multi-view setting with one generative mechanism (e.g., multiple cameras of the same type) and the multimodal setting that is characterized by distinct mechanisms (e.g., cameras and microphones). Our work generalizes previous identifiability results by redefining the generative process in terms of distinct mechanisms with modality-specific latent variables. We prove that contrastive learning can block-identify latent factors shared between modalities, even when there are nontrivial dependencies between factors. We empirically verify our identifiability results with numerical simulations and corroborate our findings on a complex multimodal dataset of image/text pairs. Zooming out, our work provides a theoretical basis for multimodal representation learning and explains in which settings multimodal contrastive learning can be effective in practice",

    "abstract": "Graph Neural Networks usually rely on the assumption that the graph topology is available to the network as well as optimal for the downstream task. Latent graph inference allows models to dynamically learn the intrinsic graph structure of problems where the connectivity patterns of data may not be directly accessible. In this work, we generalize the discrete Differentiable Graph Module (dDGM) for latent graph learning. The original dDGM architecture used the Euclidean plane to encode latent features based on which the latent graphs were generated. By incorporating Riemannian geometry into the model and generating more complex embedding spaces, we can improve the performance of the latent graph inference system. In particular, we propose a computationally tractable approach to produce product manifolds of constant curvature model spaces that can encode latent features of varying structure. The latent representations mapped onto the inferred product manifold are used to compute richer similarity measures that are leveraged by the latent graph learning model to obtain optimized latent graphs. Moreover, the curvature of the product manifold is learned during training alongside the rest of the network parameters and based on the downstream task, rather than it being a static embedding space. Our novel approach is tested on a wide range of datasets, and outperforms the original dDGM model",

    "abstract": "Diffusion models have emerged as powerful generative models in the text-to-image domain. This paper studies their application as observation-to-action models for imitating human behaviour in sequential environments. Human behaviour is stochastic and multimodal, with structured correlations between action dimensions. Meanwhile, standard modelling choices in behaviour cloning are limited in their expressiveness and may introduce bias into the cloned policy. We begin by pointing out the limitations of these choices. We then propose that diffusion models are an excellent fit for imitating human behaviour, since they learn an expressive distribution over the joint action space. We introduce several innovations to make diffusion models suitable for sequential environments; designing suitable architectures, investigating the role of guidance, and developing reliable sampling strategies. Experimentally, diffusion models closely match human demonstrations in a simulated robotic control task and a modern 3D gaming environment",

However, the formalism for these approaches generally assumes features to be shared across views to be captured coherently. We consider the problem of learning a unified representation from partial observations, where useful features may be present in only some of the views. We approach this through a probabilistic formalism enabling views to map to representations with different levels of uncertainty in different components; these views can then be integrated with one another through marginalisation over that uncertainty. Our approach, Partial Observation Experts Modelling (POEM), then enables us to meta-learn consistent representations from partial observations. We evaluate our approach on an adaptation of a comprehensive few-shot learning benchmark, Meta-Dataset, and demonstrate the benefits of POEM over other meta-learning methods at representation learning from partial observations. We further demonstrate the utility of POEM by meta-learning to represent an environment from partial views observed by an agent exploring the environment",

    "abstract": "Neural networks with physics-based inductive biases such as Lagrangian neural networks (LNNs), and Hamiltonian neural networks (HNNs) learn the dynamics of physical systems by encoding strong inductive biases. Alternatively, Neural ODEs with appropriate inductive biases have also been shown to give similar performances. However, these models, when applied to particle-based systems, are transductive in nature and hence, do not generalize to large system sizes. In this paper, we present a graph-based neural ODE, GNODE, to learn the time evolution of dynamical systems. Further, we carefully analyze the role of different inductive biases on the performance of GNODE. We show that similar to LNN and HNN, encoding the constraints explicitly can significantly improve the training efficiency and performance of GNODE significantly. Our experiments also assess the value of additional inductive biases, such as Newton’s third law, on the final performance of the model. We demonstrate that inducing these biases can enhance the performance of the model by orders of magnitude in terms of both energy violation and rollout error. Interestingly, we observe that the GNODE trained with the most effective inductive biases, namely MCGNODE, outperforms the graph versions of LNN and HNN, namely, Lagrangian graph networks (LGN) and Hamiltonian graph networks (HGN) in terms of energy violation error by ∼4 orders of magnitude for a pendulum system, and ∼2 orders of magnitude for spring systems. These results suggest that NODE-based systems can give competitive performances with energy-conserving neural networks by employing appropriate inductive biases",

    "abstract": "Planning-based reinforcement learning has shown strong performance in tasks in discrete and low-dimensional continuous action spaces. However, planning usually brings significant computational overhead for decision making, so scaling such methods to high-dimensional action spaces remains challenging. To advance efficient planning for high-dimensional continuous control, we propose Trajectory Autoencoding Planner (TAP), which learns low-dimensional latent action codes with a state-conditional VQ-VAE. The decoder of the VQ-VAE thus serves as a novel dynamics model that takes latent actions and current state as input and reconstructs long-horizon trajectories. During inference time, given a starting state, TAP searches over discrete latent actions to find trajectories that have both high probability under the training distribution and high predicted cumulative reward. Empirical evaluation in the offline RL setting demonstrates low decision latency which is indifferent to the growing raw action dimensionality. For Adroit robotic hand manipulation tasks with high-dimensional continuous action space, TAP surpasses existing model-based methods by a large margin and also beats strong model-free actor-critic baselines",

To derive this network, we choose maximum correlative information transfer from inputs to outputs as the separation objective under the constraint that the outputs are restricted to their presumed sets. The online formulation of this optimization problem naturally leads to neural networks with local learning rules. Our framework incorporates infinitely many source domain choices and flexibly models complex latent structures.

The task of text generation is then decomposed into a series of copy-and-paste operations: at each time step, we seek suitable text spans from the text collection rather than selecting from a standalone vocabulary. Experiments on the standard language modeling benchmark (WikiText-103) show that our approach achieves better generation quality according to both automatic and human evaluations. Besides, its inference efficiency is comparable to token-level autoregressive models thanks to the reduction of decoding steps. We also show that our approach allows for effective domain adaptation by simply switching to domain-specific text collection without extra training.

    "title": "The Curious Case of Benign Memorization",
    "abstract": "Despite the empirical advances of deep learning across a variety of learning tasks, our theoretical understanding of its success is still very restricted. One of the key challenges is the overparametrized nature of modern models, enabling complete overfitting of the data even if the labels are randomized, i.e. networks can completely \\textit{memorize} all given patterns. While such a memorization capacity seems worrisome, in this work we show that under training protocols that include \\textit{data augmentation}, neural networks learn to memorize entirely random labels in a benign way, i.e. they learn embeddings that lead to highly non-trivial performance under nearest neighbour probing. We demonstrate that deep models have the surprising ability to separate noise from signal by distributing the task of memorization and feature learning to different layers. As a result, only the very last layers are used for memorization, while preceding layers encode performant features which remain largely unaffected by the label noise. We explore the intricate role of the augmentations used for training and identify a memorization-generalization trade-off in terms of their diversity, marking a clear distinction to all previous works. Finally, we give a first explanation for the emergence of benign memorization by showing that \\textit{malign} memorization under data augmentation is infeasible due to the insufficient capacity of the model for the increased sample size. As a consequence, the network is forced to leverage the correlated nature of the augmentations and as a result learns meaningful features. To complete the picture, a better theory of feature learning in deep neural networks is required to fully understand the origins of this phenomenon",

To avoid excessive computation, extracting and training only on the most informative subset is drawing increasing attention. Nevertheless, it is still an open question how to select such a subset on which the model trained generalizes on par with the full data. In this paper, we propose dynamic margin selection (DynaMS). DynaMS leverages the distance from candidate samples to the classification boundary to construct the subset, and the subset is dynamically updated during model training. We show that DynaMS converges with large probability, and for the first time show both in theory and practice that dynamically updating the subset can result in better generalization over previous works. To reduce the additional computation incurred by the selection, a light parameter sharing proxy (PSP) is designed. PSP is able to faithfully evaluate instances with respect to the current model, which is necessary for dynamic selection.

We then incorporate this method to the learning process of the state-of-the-art MissForest imputation algorithm, such that it informs MissForest which features to consider to impute missing values, depending on the variable the missing value belongs to.

    "title": "Short-Term Memory Convolutions",
    "abstract": "The real-time processing of time series signals is a critical issue for many real-life applications. The idea of real-time processing is especially important in audio domain as the human perception of sound is sensitive to any kind of disturbance in perceived signals, especially the lag between auditory and visual modalities. The rise of deep learning (DL) models complicated the landscape of signal processing. Although they often have superior quality compared to standard DSP methods, this advantage is diminished by higher latency. In this work we propose novel method for minimization of inference time latency and memory consumption, called Short-Term Memory Convolution (STMC) and its transposed counterpart. The main advantage of STMC is the low latency comparable to long short-term memory (LSTM) networks. Furthermore, the training of STMC-based models is faster and more stable as the method is based solely on convolutional neural networks (CNNs). In this study we demonstrate an application of this solution to a U-Net model for a speech separation task and GhostNet model in acoustic scene classification (ASC) task. In case of speech separation we achieved a 5-fold reduction in inference time and a 2-fold reduction in latency without affecting the output quality. The inference time for ASC task was up to 4 times faster while preserving the original accuracy",

    "abstract": "In large-scale retrieval, the lexicon-weighting paradigm, learning weighted sparse representations in vocabulary space, has shown promising results with high quality and low latency. Despite it deeply exploiting the lexicon-representing capability of pre-trained language models, a crucial gap remains between language modeling and lexicon-weighting retrieval -- the former preferring certain or low-entropy words whereas the latter favoring pivot or high-entropy words -- becoming the main barrier to lexicon-weighting performance for large-scale retrieval. To bridge this gap, we propose a brand-new pre-training framework, lexicon-bottlenecked masked autoencoder (LexMAE), to learn importance-aware lexicon representations. Essentially, we present a lexicon-bottlenecked module between a normal language modeling encoder and a weakened decoder, where a continuous bag-of-words bottleneck is constructed to learn a lexicon-importance distribution in an unsupervised fashion. The pre-trained LexMAE is readily transferred to the lexicon-weighting retrieval via fine-tuning. On the ad-hoc retrieval benchmark, MS-Marco, it achieves 42.6% MRR@10 with 45.8 QPS for the passage dataset and 44.4% MRR@100 with 134.8 QPS for the document dataset, by a CPU machine.

    "abstract": "Systems neuroscience relies on two complementary views of neural data, characterized by single neuron tuning curves and analysis of population activity. These two perspectives combine elegantly in neural latent variable models that constrain the relationship between latent variables and neural activity, modeled by simple tuning curve functions.

Those and previous models, however, missed crucial shared coding properties of neural populations. We propose \nfeature sharing\n across neural tuning curves which significantly improves performance and helps optimization. We also propose a solution to the \nensemble detection\n problem, where different groups of neurons, i.e., ensembles, can be modulated by different latent manifolds. Achieved through a soft clustering of neurons during training, this allows for the separation of mixed neural populations in an unsupervised manner. These innovations lead to more interpretable models of neural population activity that train well and perform better even on mixtures of complex latent manifolds.

    "abstract": "Meta-training, which fine-tunes the language model (LM) on various downstream tasks by maximizing the likelihood of the target label given the task instruction and input instance, has improved the zero-shot task generalization performance. However, meta-trained LMs still struggle to generalize to challenging tasks containing novel labels unseen during meta-training. In this paper, we propose Flipped Learning, an alternative method of meta-training which trains the LM to generate the task instruction given the input instance and label. During inference, the LM trained with Flipped Learning, referred to as FLIPPED, selects the label option that is most likely to generate the task instruction. On 14 tasks of the BIG-bench benchmark, the 11B-sized FLIPPED outperforms zero-shot T0-11B (Sanh et al, 2021) and even a 16 times larger 3-shot GPT-3 (175B) (Brown et al, 2020) on average by 8.4% and 9.7% points, respectively. FLIPPED gives particularly large improvements on tasks with unseen labels, outperforming T0-11B by up to +20% average F1 score. This indicates that the strong task generalization of FLIPPED comes from improved generalization to novel labels. We release our code at github.com/seonghyeonye/Flipped-Learning",

    "title": "DeCap: Decoding CLIP Latents for Zero-Shot Captioning via Text-Only Training",
    "abstract": "Large-scale pre-trained multi-modal models (e.g., CLIP) demonstrate strong zero-shot transfer capability in many discriminative tasks, e.g., image classification. Their adaptation to zero-shot image-conditioned text generation tasks has drawn increasing interest. Prior arts approach to zero-shot captioning by either utilizing the existing large language models (e.g., GPT-2) or pre-training the encoder-decoder network in an end-to-end manner. However, the large language models may not generate sensible descriptions due to the task discrepancy between captioning and language modeling, while the end-to-end pre-training requires paired data and extensive computational resources. In this work, we propose a simple framework, named DeCap, for zero-shot captioning. We introduce a lightweight visual-aware language decoder. This decoder is both data-efficient and computation-efficient: 1) it only requires the \\textit{text} data for training, easing the burden on the collection of paired data. 2) it does not require end-to-end training. When trained with text-only data, the decoder takes the text embedding extracted from the off-the-shelf CLIP encoder as a prefix embedding. The challenge is that the decoder is trained on the text corpus but at the inference stage, it needs to generate captions based on visual inputs. Though the CLIP text embedding and the visual embedding are correlated, the \\textit{modality gap} issue is widely observed in multi-modal contrastive models that prevents us from directly taking the visual embedding as the prefix embedding. We propose a training-free mechanism to reduce the modality gap. We project the visual embedding into the CLIP text embedding space, while the projected embedding retains the information of the visual input. Taking the projected embedding as the prefix embedding, the decoder generates high-quality descriptions that match the visual input. The experiments show that DeCap outperforms other zero-shot captioning methods and unpaired captioning methods by a large margin on the typical image captioning benchmarks, i.e., MSCOCO and NoCaps. We apply DeCap to video captioning and achieve state-of-the-art zero-shot performance on MSR-VTT and ActivityNet-Captions. The code is available at https://github.com/dhg-wei/DeCap",

Currently, the doubly robust (DR) methods have been widely studied and demonstrate superior performance. However, in this paper, we show that DR methods are unstable and have unbounded bias, variance, and generalization bounds to extremely small propensities. Moreover, the fact that DR relies more on extrapolation will lead to suboptimal performance. To address the above limitations while retaining double robustness, we propose a stabilized doubly robust (StableDR) learning approach with a weaker reliance on extrapolation. Theoretical analysis shows that StableDR has bounded bias, variance, and generalization error bound simultaneously under inaccurate imputed errors and arbitrarily small propensities. In addition, we propose a novel learning approach for StableDR that updates the imputation, propensity, and prediction models cyclically, achieving more stable and accurate predictions.

    "abstract": "Deep learning models have been widely used in commercial acoustic systems in recent years. However, adversarial audio examples can cause abnormal behaviors for those acoustic systems, while being hard for humans to perceive. Various methods, such as transformation-based defenses and adversarial training, have been proposed to protect acoustic systems from adversarial attacks, but they are less effective against adaptive attacks. Furthermore, directly applying the methods from the image domain can lead to suboptimal results because of the unique properties of audio data. In this paper, we propose an adversarial purification-based defense pipeline, AudioPure, for acoustic systems via off-the-shelf diffusion models. Taking advantage of the strong generation ability of diffusion models, AudioPure first adds a small amount of noise to the adversarial audio and then runs the reverse sampling step to purify the noisy audio and recover clean audio. AudioPure is a plug-and-play method that can be directly applied to any pretrained classifier without any fine-tuning or re-training. We conduct extensive experiments on the speech command recognition task to evaluate the robustness of AudioPure. Our method is effective against diverse adversarial attacks (e.g. L2 or L∞-norm). It outperforms the existing methods under both strong adaptive white-box and black-box attacks bounded by L2 or L∞-norm (up to +20% in robust accuracy). Besides, we also evaluate the certified robustness for perturbations bounded by L2-norm via randomized smoothing. Our pipeline achieves a higher certified accuracy than baselines",

    "title": "Theoretical Characterization of the Generalization Performance of Overfitted Meta-Learning",
    "abstract": "Meta-learning has arisen as a successful method for improving training performance by training over many similar tasks, especially with deep neural networks (DNNs). However, the theoretical understanding of when and why overparameterized models such as DNNs can generalize well in meta-learning is still limited. As an initial step towards addressing this challenge, this paper studies the generalization performance of overfitted meta-learning under a linear regression model with Gaussian features. In contrast to a few recent studies along the same line, our framework allows the number of model parameters to be arbitrarily larger than the number of features in the ground truth signal, and hence naturally captures the overparameterized regime in practical deep meta-learning. We show that the overfitted min \nℓ\n2\n-norm solution of model-agnostic meta-learning (MAML) can be beneficial, which is similar to the recent remarkable findings on \"benign overfitting\" and \"double descent\" phenomenon in the classical (single-task) linear regression. However, due to the uniqueness of meta-learning such as task-specific gradient descent inner training and the diversity/fluctuation of the ground-truth signals among training tasks, we find new and interesting properties that do not exist in single-task linear regression. We first provide a high-probability upper bound (under reasonable tightness) on the generalization error, where certain terms decrease when the number of features increases. Our analysis suggests that benign overfitting is more significant and easier to observe when the noise and the diversity/fluctuation of the ground truth of each training task are large. Under this circumstance, we show that the overfitted min \nℓ\n2\n-norm solution can achieve an even lower generalization error than the underparameterized solution",

By propagating a compact input or parameter set as symbolic intervals through the forwards and backwards computations of the neural network we can formally certify the robustness of gradient-based explanations. Our bounds are differentiable, hence we can incorporate provable explanation robustness into neural network training.

    "abstract": "In offline reinforcement learning, weighted regression is a common method to ensure the learned policy stays close to the behavior policy and to prevent selecting out-of-sample actions. In this work, we show that due to the limited distributional expressivity of policy models, previous methods might still select unseen actions during training, which deviates from their initial motivation. To address this problem, we adopt a generative approach by decoupling the learned policy into two parts: an expressive generative behavior model and an action evaluation model. The key insight is that such decoupling avoids learning an explicitly parameterized policy model with a closed-form expression. Directly learning the behavior policy allows us to leverage existing advances in generative modeling, such as diffusion-based methods, to model diverse behaviors. As for action evaluation, we combine our method with an in-sample planning technique to further avoid selecting out-of-sample actions and increase computational efficiency. Experimental results on D4RL datasets show that our proposed method achieves competitive or superior performance compared with state-of-the-art offline RL methods, especially in complex tasks such as AntMaze.

    "abstract": "Reinforcement Learning (RL) methods are typically applied directly in environments to learn policies. In some complex environments with continuous state-action spaces, sparse rewards, and/or long temporal horizons, learning a good policy in the original environments can be difficult. Focusing on the offline RL setting, we aim to build a simple and discrete world model that abstracts the original environment. RL methods are applied to our world model instead of the environment data for simplified policy learning. Our world model, dubbed Value Memory Graph (VMG), is designed as a directed-graph-based Markov decision process (MDP) of which vertices and directed edges represent graph states and graph actions, separately. As state-action spaces of VMG are finite and relatively small compared to the original environment, we can directly apply the value iteration algorithm on VMG to estimate graph state values and figure out the best graph actions. VMG is trained from and built on the offline RL dataset. Together with an action translator that converts the abstract graph actions in VMG to real actions in the original environment, VMG controls agents to maximize episode returns. Our experiments on the D4RL benchmark show that VMG can outperform state-of-the-art offline RL methods in several tasks, especially when environments have sparse rewards and long temporal horizons.

While such generalization significantly speeds up training, each energy evaluation still requires Monte Carlo integration which limits the evaluation to a few geometries. In this work, we address the inference shortcomings by proposing the Potential learning from ab-initio Networks (PlaNet) framework, in which we simultaneously train a surrogate model in addition to the neural wave function. At inference time, the surrogate avoids expensive Monte-Carlo integration by directly estimating the energy, accelerating the process from hours to milliseconds. In this way, we can accurately model high-resolution multi-dimensional energy surfaces for larger systems that previously were unobtainable via neural wave functions. Finally, we explore an additional inductive bias by introducing physically-motivated restricted neural wave function models. We implement such a function with several additional improvements in the new PESNet++ model. In our experimental evaluation, PlaNet accelerates inference by 7 orders of magnitude for larger molecules like ethanol while preserving accuracy. Compared to previous energy surface networks, PESNet++ reduces energy errors by up to 74%",

    "abstract": "The expressive power of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) is fundamental for understanding their capabilities and  limitations, i.e., what graph properties can or cannot be learnt by a GNN. Since standard GNNs have been characterised to be upper-bounded by the Weisfeiler-Lehman (1-WL) algorithm, recent attempts concentrated on developing more expressive GNNs in terms of the \nk\n-WL hierarchy, a well-established framework for graph isormorphism tests. In this work we show that, contrary to the widely accepted view, the \nk\n-WL hierarchy is not well-suited for measuring expressive GNNs. This is due to limitations that are inherent to high-dimensional WL algorithms such as the lack of a natural interpretation and high computational costs, which makes it difficult to draw any firm conclusions about the expressive power of GNNs beyond 1-WL. Thus, we propose a novel hierarchy of graph isomorphism tests, namely Neighbourhood WL (\nN\n-WL), and also establish a new theorem on the equivalence of expressivity between induced connected subgraphs and induced subgraphs within this hierarchy. Further, we design a GNN model upon \nN\n-WL, Graph Neighbourhood Neural Network (G3N), and empirically verify its expressive power on synthetic and real-world benchmarks",

    "title": "Learning Input-agnostic Manipulation Directions in StyleGAN with Text Guidance",
    "abstract": "With the advantages of fast inference and human-friendly flexible manipulation, image-agnostic style manipulation via text guidance enables new applications that were not previously available. The state-of-the-art text-guided image-agnostic manipulation method embeds the representation of each channel of StyleGAN independently in the Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) space, and provides it in the form of a Dictionary to quickly find out the channel-wise manipulation direction during inference time. However, in this paper we argue that this dictionary which is constructed by controlling single channel individually is limited to accommodate the versatility of text guidance since the collective and interactive relation among multiple channels are not considered. Indeed, we show that it fails to discover a large portion of manipulation directions that can be found by existing methods, which manually manipulates latent space without texts. To alleviate this issue, we propose a novel method that learns a Dictionary, whose entry corresponds to the representation of a single channel, by taking into account the manipulation effect coming from the interaction with multiple other channels. We demonstrate that our strategy resolves the inability of previous methods in finding diverse known directions from unsupervised methods and unknown directions from random text while maintaining the real-time inference speed and disentanglement ability",

    "title": "TDR-CL: Targeted Doubly Robust Collaborative Learning for Debiased Recommendations",
    "abstract": "Bias is a common problem inherent in recommender systems, which is entangled with users' preferences and poses a great challenge to unbiased learning. For debiasing tasks, the doubly robust (DR) method and its variants show superior performance due to the double robustness property, that is, DR is unbiased when either imputed errors or learned propensities are accurate.\nHowever, our theoretical analysis reveals that DR usually has a large variance. Meanwhile, DR would suffer unexpectedly large bias and poor generalization caused by inaccurate imputed errors and learned propensities, which usually occur in practice. In this paper, we propose a principled approach that can effectively reduce the bias and variance simultaneously for existing DR approaches when the error  imputation model is misspecified. In addition, we further propose a novel semi-parametric collaborative learning approach that decomposes imputed errors into parametric and nonparametric parts and updates them collaboratively, resulting in more accurate predictions. Both theoretical analysis and experiments demonstrate the superiority of the proposed methods compared with existing debiasing methods",

    "abstract": "We tackle the domain generalisation (DG) problem by posing it as a domain adaptation (DA) task where we adversarially synthesise the worst-case `target' domain and adapt a model to that worst-case domain, thereby improving the model’s robustness. To synthesise data that is challenging yet semantics-preserving, we generate Fourier amplitude images and combine them with source domain phase images, exploiting the widely believed conjecture from signal processing that amplitude spectra mainly determines image style, while phase data mainly captures image semantics. To synthesise a worst-case domain for adaptation, we train the classifier and the amplitude generator adversarially. Specifically, we exploit the maximum classifier discrepancy (MCD) principle from DA that relates the target domain performance to the discrepancy of classifiers in the model hypothesis space. By Bayesian hypothesis modeling, we express the model hypothesis space effectively as a posterior distribution over classifiers given the source domains, making adversarial MCD minimisation feasible. On the DomainBed benchmark including the large-scale DomainNet dataset, the proposed approach yields significantly improved domain generalisation performance over the state-of-the-art",

    "title": "Consolidator: Mergable Adapter with Group Connections for Visual Adaptation",
    "abstract": "Recently, transformers have shown strong ability as visual feature extractors, surpassing traditional convolution-based models in various scenarios. However, the success of vision transformers largely owes to their capacity to accommodate numerous parameters. As a result, new challenges for adapting a well-trained transformer to downstream tasks arise. On the one hand, classic fine-tuning tunes all parameters in a huge model for every downstream task and thus easily falls into an overfitting situation, leading to inferior performance. On the other hand, on resource-limited devices, fine-tuning stores a full copy of all parameters and thus is usually impracticable for the shortage of storage space. However, few works have focused on how to efficiently and effectively transfer knowledge in a vision transformer. Existing methods did not dive into the properties of visual features, leading to inferior performance. Moreover, some of them bring heavy inference cost though benefiting storage. To tackle these problems, we propose consolidator to achieve efficient transfer learning for large vision models. Our consolidator modifies the pre-trained model with the addition of a small set of tunable parameters to temporarily store the task-specific knowledge while freezing the backbone model during adaptation. Motivated by the success of group-wise convolution, we adopt grouped connections across the features extracted by fully connected layers to construct tunable parts in a consolidator. To further enhance the model's capacity to transfer knowledge under a constrained storage budget and keep inference efficient, we consolidate the parameters in two stages: 1. between adaptation and storage, and 2. between loading and inference. On a series of downstream visual tasks, our consolidator can reach up to 7.56 better accuracy than full fine-tuning with merely 0.35% parameters, and outperform state-of-the-art parameter-efficient tuning methods by a clear margin.

    "abstract": "Deep Graph Networks (DGNs) currently dominate the research landscape of learning from graphs, due to their efficiency and ability to implement an adaptive message-passing scheme between the nodes. However, DGNs are typically limited in their ability to propagate and preserve long-term dependencies between nodes, i.e., they suffer from the over-squashing phenomena. As a result, \nwe can expect them to under-perform, since different problems require to capture interactions at different (and possibly large) radii in order to be effectively solved. In this work, we present Anti-Symmetric Deep Graph Networks (A-DGNs), a framework for stable and non-dissipative DGN design, conceived through the lens of ordinary differential equations. We give theoretical proof that our method is stable and non-dissipative, leading to two key results: long-range information between nodes is preserved, and no gradient vanishing or explosion occurs in training. We empirically validate the proposed approach on several graph benchmarks, showing that A-DGN yields to improved performance and enables to learn effectively even when dozens of layers are used",

In each round, the algorithm recommends one item per user, for which it gets a (noisy) reward sampled from a low-rank user-item preference matrix. The goal is to design a method with sub-linear regret (in \nT\n) and nearly optimal dependence on \nM\n and \nN\n. The problem can be easily mapped to the standard multi-armed bandit problem where each item is an independent arm, but that leads to poor regret as the correlation between arms and users is not exploited. On the other hand, exploiting the low-rank structure of reward matrix is challenging due to non-convexity of the low-rank manifold. We first demonstrate that the low-rank structure can be exploited  using a simple  explore-then-commit (ETC) approach that ensures a regret of \nO\n(\npolylog\n(\nM\n+\nN\n)\nT\n2\n/\n3\n)\n. That is, roughly only \npolylog\n(\nM\n+\nN\n)\n item recommendations are required per user to get a non-trivial solution. We then improve our result for the  rank-\n1\n setting which in itself is quite challenging and encapsulates some of the key issues. Here, we propose OCTAL (Online Collaborative filTering using iterAtive user cLustering) that guarantees nearly optimal regret of \nO\n(\npolylog\n(\nM\n+\nN\n)\nT\n1\n/\n2\n)\n. OCTAL is based on a novel technique of clustering users that allows iterative elimination of items and leads to a nearly optimal minimax rate",

In the literature,  the explanation is often provided by saliency attribution to the features of the RL agent's state. In this work, we propose a complementary approach to these explanations, particularly for offline RL, where we attribute the policy decisions of a trained RL agent to the trajectories encountered by it during training. To do so, we encode trajectories in offline training data individually as well as collectively (encoding a set of trajectories). We then attribute policy decisions to a set of trajectories in this encoded space by estimating the sensitivity of the decision with respect to that set.  Further, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in terms of quality of attributions as well as practical scalability in diverse environments that involve both discrete and continuous state and action spaces such as grid-worlds, video games (Atari) and continuous control (MuJoCo). We also conduct a human study on a simple navigation task to observe how their understanding of the task compares with data attributed for a trained RL policy",

    "abstract": "Existing Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) compute the message exchange between nodes by either aggregating uniformly (convolving) the features of all the neighbor- ing nodes, or by applying a non-uniform score (attending) to the features. Recent works have shown the strengths and weaknesses of the resulting GNN architectures, respectively, GCNs and GATs. In this work, we aim at exploiting the strengths of both approaches to their full extent. To this end, we first introduce the graph convolutional attention layer (CAT), which relies on convolutions to compute the attention scores. Unfortunately, as in the case of GCNs and GATs, we show that there exists no clear winner between the three—neither theoretically nor in practice—as their performance directly depends on the nature of the data (i.e., of the graph and features). This result brings us to the main contribution of our work, the learnable graph convolutional attention network (L-CAT): a GNN architecture that automatically interpolates between GCN, GAT and CAT in each layer, by adding only two scalar parameters. Our results demonstrate that L-CAT is able to efficiently combine different GNN layers along the network, outperforming competing methods in a wide range of datasets, and resulting in a more robust model that reduces the need of cross-validating",

In vanilla KD, the teacher primarily sets a predictive target for the student to follow, and we posit that this target is overly optimistic due to the student's lack of capacity. We develop a novel scaffolding scheme where the teacher, in addition to setting a predictive target, also scaffolds the student's prediction by censoring hard-to-learn examples. Scaffolding utilizes the same information as the teacher's soft-max predictions as inputs, and in this sense, our proposal can be viewed as a natural variant of vanilla KD. We show on synthetic examples that censoring hard-examples leads to smoothening the student's loss landscape so that the student encounters fewer local minima. As a result, it has good generalization properties. Against vanilla KD, we achieve improved performance and are comparable to more intrusive techniques that leverage feature matching on benchmark datasets",

We propose an algorithm that allows the user to tune this hyperparameter at runtime, thereby addressing both of the above mentioned issues simultaneously.

    "abstract": "Despite recent successes with neural models for sign language translation (SLT), translation quality still lags behind spoken languages because of the data scarcity and modality gap between sign video and text. To address both problems, we investigate strategies for cross-modality representation sharing for SLT. We propose SLTUNET, a simple unified neural model designed to support multiple SLTrelated tasks jointly, such as sign-to-gloss, gloss-to-text and sign-to-text translation. Jointly modeling different tasks endows SLTUNET with the capability to explore the cross-task relatedness that could help narrow the modality gap. In addition, this allows us to leverage the knowledge from external resources, such as abundant parallel data used for spoken-language machine translation (MT). We show in experiments that SLTUNET achieves competitive and even state-of-the-art performance on PHOENIX-2014T and CSL-Daily when augmented with MT data and equipped with a set of optimization techniques. We further use the DGS Corpus for end-to-end SLT for the first time. It covers broader domains with a significantly larger vocabulary, which is more challenging and which we consider to allow for a more realistic assessment of the current state of SLT than the former two. Still, SLTUNET obtains improved results on the DGS Corpus. Code is available at https://github.com/bzhangGo/sltunet",

Although various active learning solutions for object detection have been proposed, most existing works do not take advantage of epistemic uncertainty, which is an important metric for capturing the usefulness of the sample. Also, previous works pay little attention to the attributes of each bounding box (e.g., nearest object, box size) when computing the informativeness of an image. In this paper, we propose a new active learning strategy for object detection that overcomes the shortcomings of prior works. To make use of epistemic uncertainty, we adopt evidential deep learning (EDL) and propose a new module termed model evidence head (MEH), that makes EDL highly compatible with object detection. Based on the computed epistemic uncertainty of each bounding box, we propose hierarchical uncertainty aggregation (HUA) for obtaining the informativeness of an image. HUA realigns all bounding boxes into multiple levels based on the attributes and aggregates uncertainties in a bottom-up order, to effectively capture the context within the image.

    "abstract": "Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) is a highly effective regularization technique for improving the generalization of deep neural networks for various settings. However, the underlying working of SAM remains elusive because of various intriguing approximations in the theoretical characterizations. SAM intends to penalize a notion of sharpness of the model but implements a computationally efficient variant; moreover, a third notion of sharpness was used for proving generalization guarantees. The subtle differences in these notions of sharpness can indeed lead to significantly different empirical results. This paper rigorously nails down the exact sharpness notion that SAM regularizes and clarifies the underlying mechanism. We also show that the two steps of approximations in the original motivation of SAM individually lead to inaccurate local conclusions, but their combination accidentally reveals the correct effect, when full-batch gradients are applied. Furthermore, we also prove that the stochastic version of SAM in fact regularizes the third notion of sharpness mentioned above, which is most likely to be the preferred notion for practical performance. The key mechanism behind this intriguing phenomenon is  the alignment between the gradient and the top eigenvector of Hessian when SAM is applied",

However, different downstream tasks require different invariances for their best performance, so the optimal choice of augmentations for SSL depends on the target task. In this paper, we aim to learn self-supervised features that generalize well across a variety of downstream tasks (e.g., object classification, detection and instance segmentation) without knowing any task information beforehand. We do so by Masked Augmentation Subspace Training (or MAST) to encode in the single feature space the priors from different data augmentations in a factorized way. Specifically, we disentangle the feature space into separate subspaces, each induced by a learnable mask that selects relevant feature dimensions to model invariance to a specific augmentation. We show the success of MAST in jointly capturing generalizable priors from different augmentations, using both unique and shared features across the subspaces. We further show that MAST benefits from uncertainty modeling to reweight ambiguous samples from strong augmentations that may cause similarity mismatch in each subspace. Experiments demonstrate that MAST consistently improves generalization on various downstream tasks, while being task-agnostic and efficient during SSL. We also provide interesting insights about how different augmentations are related and how uncertainty reflects learning difficulty",

Variational Markov Decision Processes (VAE-MDPs) are discrete latent space models that provide a reliable framework for distilling formally verifiable controllers from any RL policy. While the related guarantees address relevant practical aspects such as the satisfaction of performance and safety properties, the VAE approach suffers from several learning flaws (posterior collapse, slow learning speed, poor dynamics estimates), primarily due to the absence of abstraction and representation guarantees to support latent optimization. We introduce the Wasserstein auto-encoded MDP (WAE-MDP), a latent space model that fixes those issues by minimizing a penalized form of the optimal transport between the behaviors of the agent executing the original policy and the distilled policy, for which the formal guarantees apply. Our approach yields bisimulation guarantees while learning the distilled policy, allowing concrete optimization of the abstraction and representation model quality. Our experiments show that, besides distilling policies up to 10 times faster, the latent model quality is indeed better in general. Moreover, we present experiments from a simple time-to-failure verification algorithm on the latent space.

    "abstract": "Deep neural networks may easily memorize noisy labels present in real-world data, which degrades their ability to generalize. It is therefore important to track and evaluate the robustness of models against noisy label memorization. We propose a metric, called \nsusceptibility\n, to gauge such memorization for neural networks. Susceptibility is simple and easy to compute during training. Moreover, it does not require access to ground-truth labels and it only uses unlabeled data. We empirically show the effectiveness of our metric in tracking memorization on various architectures and datasets and provide theoretical insights into the design of the susceptibility metric. Finally, we show through extensive experiments on datasets with synthetic and real-world label noise that one can utilize susceptibility and the overall training accuracy to distinguish models that maintain a low memorization on the training set and generalize well to unseen clean data",

    "title": "Policy-Based Self-Competition for Planning Problems",
    "abstract": "AlphaZero-type algorithms may stop improving on single-player tasks in case the value network guiding the tree search is unable to approximate the outcome of an episode sufficiently well. One technique to address this problem is transforming the single-player task through self-competition. The main idea is to compute a scalar baseline from the agent’s historical performances and to reshape an episode’s reward into a binary output, indicating whether the baseline has been exceeded or not. However, this baseline only carries limited information for the agent about strategies how to improve. We leverage the idea of self-competition and directly incorporate a historical policy into the planning process instead of its scalar performance. Based on the recently introduced Gumbel AlphaZero (GAZ), we propose our algorithm GAZ ‘Play-to-Plan’ (GAZ PTP), in which the agent learns to find strong trajectories by planning against possible strategies of its past self. We show the effectiveness of our approach in two well-known combinatorial optimization problems, the Traveling Salesman Problem and the Job-Shop Scheduling Problem. With only half of the simulation budget for search, GAZ PTP consistently outperforms all selected single-player variants of GAZ",

    "title": "Out-of-Distribution Detection based on In-Distribution Data Patterns Memorization with Modern Hopfield Energy",
    "abstract": "Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection is essential for safety-critical applications of deep neural networks. OOD detection is challenging since DNN models may produce very high logits value even for OOD samples. Hence, it is of great difficulty to discriminate OOD data by directly adopting Softmax on output logits as the confidence score. Differently, we detect the OOD sample with Hopfield energy in a store-then-compare paradigm. In more detail, penultimate layer outputs on the training set are considered as the representations of in-distribution (ID) data. Thus they can be transformed into stored patterns that serve as anchors to measure the discrepancy of unseen data for OOD detection. Starting from the energy function defined in Modern Hopfield Network for the discrepancy score calculation, we derive a simplified version SHE with theoretical analysis. In SHE, we utilize only one stored pattern to present each class, and these patterns can be obtained by simply averaging the penultimate layer outputs of training samples within this class. SHE has the advantages of hyperparameterfree\nand high computational efficiency. The evaluations of nine widely-used OOD datasets show the promising performance of such a simple yet effective approach and its superiority over State-of-the-Art models.

    "abstract": "The goal of multi-objective reinforcement learning (MORL) is to learn policies that simultaneously optimize multiple competing objectives. In practice, an agent's preferences over the objectives may not be known apriori, and hence, we require policies that can generalize to arbitrary preferences at test time. In this work, we propose a new data-driven setup for offline MORL, where we wish to learn a preference-agnostic policy agent using only a finite dataset of offline demonstrations of other agents and their preferences. The key contributions of this work are two-fold. First, we introduce D4MORL, (D)atasets for MORL that are specifically designed for offline settings. It contains 1.8 million annotated demonstrations obtained by rolling out reference policies that optimize for randomly sampled preferences on 6 MuJoCo environments with 2-3 objectives each. Second, we propose Pareto-Efficient Decision Agents (PEDA), a family of offline MORL algorithms that builds and extends Decision Transformers via a novel preference-and-return-conditioned policy. Empirically, we show that PEDA closely approximates the behavioral policy on the D4MORL benchmark and provides an excellent approximation of the Pareto-front with appropriate conditioning, as measured by the hypervolume and sparsity metrics",

    "title": "NAGphormer: A Tokenized Graph Transformer for Node Classification in Large Graphs",
    "abstract": "The graph Transformer emerges as a new architecture and has shown superior performance on various graph mining tasks. In this work, we observe that existing graph Transformers treat nodes as independent tokens and construct a single long sequence composed of all node tokens so as to train the Transformer model, causing it hard to scale to large graphs due to the quadratic complexity on the number of nodes for the self-attention computation. To this end, we propose a Neighborhood Aggregation Graph Transformer (NAGphormer) that treats each node as a sequence containing a series of tokens constructed by our proposed Hop2Token module. For each node, Hop2Token aggregates the neighborhood features from different hops into different representations and thereby produces a sequence of token vectors as one input. In this way, NAGphormer could be trained in a mini-batch manner and thus could scale to large graphs. Moreover, we mathematically show that as compared to a category of advanced Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), the decoupled Graph Convolutional Network, NAGphormer could learn more informative node representations from the multi-hop neighborhoods. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets from small to large are conducted to demonstrate that NAGphormer consistently outperforms existing graph Transformers and mainstream GNNs.

    "title": "Discovering Generalizable Multi-agent Coordination Skills from Multi-task Offline Data",
    "abstract": "Cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) faces the challenge of adapting to multiple tasks with varying agents and targets. Previous multi-task MARL approaches require costly interactions to simultaneously learn or fine-tune policies in different tasks. However, the situation that an agent should generalize to multiple tasks with only offline data from limited tasks is more in line with the needs of real-world applications. Since offline multi-task data contains a variety of behaviors, an effective data-driven approach is to extract informative latent variables that can represent universal skills for realizing coordination across tasks. In this paper, we propose a novel Offline MARL algorithm to Discover coordInation Skills (ODIS) from multi-task data. ODIS first extracts task-invariant coordination skills from offline multi-task data and learns to delineate different agent behaviors with the discovered coordination skills. Then we train a coordination policy to choose optimal coordination skills with the centralized training and decentralized execution paradigm. We further demonstrate that the discovered coordination skills can assign effective coordinative behaviors, thus significantly enhancing generalization to unseen tasks. Empirical results in cooperative MARL benchmarks, including the StarCraft multi-agent challenge, show that ODIS obtains superior performance in a wide range of tasks only with offline data from limited sources",

    "abstract": "Diversity is a growing research topic in Reinforcement Learning (RL). Previous research on diversity has mainly focused on promoting diversity to encourage exploration and thereby improve quality (the cumulative reward), maximizing diversity subject to quality constraints, or jointly maximizing quality and diversity, known as the quality-diversity problem. In this work, we present the quality-similar diversity problem that features diversity among policies of similar qualities. In contrast to task-agnostic diversity, we focus on task-specific diversity defined by a set of user-specified Behavior Descriptors (BDs). A BD is a scalar function of a trajectory (e.g., the fire action rate for an Atari game), which delivers the type of diversity the user prefers. To derive the gradient of the user-specified diversity with respect to a policy, which is not trivially available, we introduce a set of BD estimators and connect it with the classical policy gradient theorem. Based on the diversity gradient, we develop a population-based RL algorithm to adaptively and efficiently optimize the population diversity at multiple quality levels throughout training. Extensive results on MuJoCo and Atari demonstrate that our algorithm significantly outperforms previous methods in terms of generating user-specified diverse policies across different quality levels",

    "title": "Better Teacher Better Student: Dynamic Prior Knowledge for Knowledge Distillation",
    "abstract": "Knowledge distillation (KD) has shown very promising capabilities in transferring learning representations from large models (teachers) to small models (students). However, as the capacity gap between students and teachers becomes larger, existing KD methods fail to achieve better results. Our work shows that the 'prior knowledge' is vital to KD, especially when applying large teachers.  Particularly, we propose the dynamic prior knowledge (DPK), which integrates part of teacher's features as the prior knowledge before the feature distillation. This means that our method also takes the teacher's feature as `input', not just `target'. Besides, we dynamically adjust the ratio of the prior knowledge during the training phase according to the feature gap, thus guiding the student in an appropriate difficulty. To evaluate the proposed method, we conduct extensive experiments on two image classification benchmarks (i.e. CIFAR100 and ImageNet) and an object detection benchmark (\\i.e. MS COCO). The results demonstrate the superiority of our method in performance under varying settings. Besides, our DPK makes the performance of the student model positively correlated with that of the teacher model, which means that we can further boost the accuracy of students by applying larger teachers. More importantly, DPK provides a fast solution in teacher model selection for any given model. Our codes will be publicly available for reproducibility",

While many generative models from the computer vision domain, such as variational autoencoders or generative adversarial networks, have been adapted for tabular data generation, less research has been directed towards recent transformer-based large language models (LLMs), which are also generative in nature. To this end, we propose GReaT (Generation of Realistic Tabular data), which exploits an auto-regressive generative LLM to sample synthetic and yet highly realistic tabular data. Furthermore, GReaT can model tabular data distributions by conditioning on any subset of features; the remaining features are sampled without additional overhead. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in a series of experiments that quantify the validity and quality of the produced data samples from multiple angles. We find that GReaT maintains state-of-the-art performance across numerous real-world and synthetic data sets with heterogeneous feature types coming in various sizes",

Recently, Granger causality inference is gaining momentum due to its good explainability and high compatibility with emerging deep neural networks. However, most existing methods assume structured input data and degenerate greatly when encountering data with randomly missing entries or non-uniform sampling frequencies, which hampers their applications in real scenarios. To address this issue, here we present CUTS, a neural Granger causal discovery algorithm to jointly impute unobserved data points and build causal graphs, via plugging in two mutually boosting modules in an iterative framework: (i) Latent data prediction stage: designs a Delayed Supervision Graph Neural Network (DSGNN) to hallucinate and register unstructured data which might be of high dimension and with complex distribution; (ii) Causal graph fitting stage: builds a causal adjacency matrix with imputed data under sparse penalty. Experiments show that CUTS effectively infers causal graphs from irregular time-series data, with significantly superior performance to existing methods. Our approach constitutes a promising step towards applying causal discovery to real applications with non-ideal observations",

Quantization, especially coarse quantization such as 1-bit sign measurements, leads to severe information loss and thus a good prior knowledge of the unknown signal is helpful for accurate recovery. Motivated by the power of score-based generative models (SGM, also known as diffusion models) in capturing the rich structure of natural signals beyond simple sparsity, we propose an unsupervised data-driven approach called quantized compressed sensing with SGM (QCS-SGM), where the prior distribution is modeled by a pre-trained SGM. To perform posterior sampling, an annealed pseudo-likelihood score called \nnoise perturbed pseudo-likelihood score\n is introduced and combined with the prior score of SGM. The proposed QCS-SGM applies to an arbitrary number of quantization bits. Experiments on a variety of baseline datasets demonstrate that the proposed QCS-SGM significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art algorithms by a large margin for both in-distribution and out-of-distribution samples. Moreover, as a posterior sampling method, QCS-SGM can be easily used to obtain confidence intervals or uncertainty estimates of the reconstructed results. \nThe code is available at\n https://github.com/mengxiangming/QCS-SGM",

Specifically, VaLM builds on a novel latent text-image alignment method via an image retrieval module to fetch corresponding images given a textual context. With the visually-augmented context, VaLM uses a visual knowledge fusion layer to enable multimodal grounded language modeling by attending on both text context and visual knowledge in images. We evaluate VaLM on various visual knowledge intensive commonsense reasoning tasks, which require visual information to excel.

Network parameters are optimized simultaneously without architectural manipulations, by solving a constrained minimax game between the encoding and decoding maps over a single rate reduction-based objective.

    "title": "What Do Self-Supervised Vision Transformers Learn?",
    "abstract": "We present a comparative study on how and why contrastive learning (CL) and masked image modeling (MIM) differ in their representations and in their performance of downstream tasks. In particular, we demonstrate that self-supervised Vision Transformers (ViTs) have the following properties: (1) CL trains self-attentions to capture longer-range global patterns than MIM, such as the shape of an object, especially in the later layers of the ViT architecture. This CL property helps ViTs linearly separate images in their representation spaces. However, it also makes the self-attentions collapse into homogeneity for all query tokens and heads. Such homogeneity of self-attention reduces the diversity of representations, worsening scalability and dense prediction performance. (2) CL utilizes the low-frequency signals of the representations, but MIM utilizes high-frequencies. Since low- and high-frequency information respectively represent shapes and textures, CL is more shape-oriented and MIM more texture-oriented. (3) CL plays a crucial role in the later layers, while MIM mainly focuses on the early layers. Upon these analyses, we find that CL and MIM can complement each other and observe that even the simplest harmonization can help leverage the advantages of both methods.

    "abstract": "Standard empirical risk minimization (ERM) training can produce deep neural network (DNN) models that are accurate on average but under-perform in under-represented population subgroups, especially when there are imbalanced group distributions in the long-tailed training data. Therefore, approaches that improve the accuracy - group robustness trade-off frontier of a DNN model (i.e. improving worst-group accuracy without sacrificing average accuracy, or vice versa) is of crucial importance.   Uncertainty-based active learning (AL) can potentially improve the frontier by preferentially sampling underrepresented subgroups to create a more balanced training dataset.  However, the quality of uncertainty estimates from modern DNNs tend to degrade in the presence of spurious correlations and dataset bias, compromising the effectiveness of AL for sampling tail groups. In this work, we propose Introspective Self-play (ISP), a simple approach to improve the uncertainty estimation of a deep neural network under dataset bias, by adding an auxiliary introspection task requiring a model to predict the bias for each data point in addition to the label. We show that ISP provably improves the bias-awareness of the model representation and the resulting uncertainty estimates. On two real-world tabular and language tasks,ISP serves as a simple “plug-in” for AL model training, consistently improving both the tail-group sampling rate and the final accuracy-fairness trade-off frontier of popular AL methods",

    "abstract": "A successful paradigm in representation learning is to perform self-supervised pretraining using tasks based on mini-batch statistics; (e.g., SimCLR, VICReg, SwAV, MSN). We show that in the formulation of all these methods is an overlooked prior to learn features that enable uniform clustering of the data. While this prior has led to remarkably semantic representations when pretraining on class-balanced data, such as ImageNet, we demonstrate that it can hamper performance when pretraining on class-imbalanced data. By moving away from conventional uniformity priors and instead preferring power-law distributed feature clusters, we show that one can improve the quality of the learned representations on real-world class-imbalanced datasets. To demonstrate this, we develop an extension of the Masked Siamese Networks (MSN) method to support the use of arbitrary features priors",

    "abstract": "Language models have recently achieved strong performance across a wide range of NLP benchmarks. However, real world tasks are often poorly specified, and agents must deduce the intended behavior from a combination of context, instructions, and examples. We investigate how both humans and models behave in the face of such task ambiguity by proposing AmbiBench, a new benchmark of six ambiguously-specified classification tasks. We evaluate humans and models on AmbiBench by seeing how well they identify the intended task using 1) instructions with varying degrees of ambiguity, and 2) different numbers of labeled examples. We find that the combination of model scaling (to 175B parameters) and reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) enables models to approach or exceed the accuracy of human participants across tasks, but that either one of these alone is not sufficient. In addition, we show how to dramatically improve the accuracy of language models trained without RLHF by finetuning on a small number of ambiguous in-context examples, providing a promising direction for teaching models to generalize well in the face of ambiguity",

    "abstract": "Preference-based reinforcement learning (RL) provides a framework to train agents using human preferences between two behaviors. However, preference-based RL has been challenging to scale since it requires a large amount of human feedback to learn a reward function aligned with human intent. In this paper, we present Preference Transformer, a neural architecture that models human preferences using transformers. Unlike prior approaches assuming human judgment is based on the Markovian rewards which contribute to the decision equally, we introduce a new preference model based on the weighted sum of non-Markovian rewards. We then design the proposed preference model using a transformer architecture that stacks causal and bidirectional self-attention layers. We demonstrate that Preference Transformer can solve a variety of control tasks using real human preferences, while prior approaches fail to work. We also show that Preference Transformer can induce a well-specified reward and attend to critical events in the trajectory by automatically capturing the temporal dependencies in human decision-making.

However, mainstream network representation learning models focus on propagating and aggregating node attributes, lacking specific designs to utilize text semantics on edges. While there exist edge-aware graph neural networks, they directly initialize edge attributes as a feature vector, which cannot fully capture the contextualized text semantics of edges. In this paper, we propose Edgeformers, a framework built upon graph-enhanced Transformers, to perform edge and node representation learning by modeling texts on edges in a contextualized way. Specifically, in edge representation learning, we inject network information into each Transformer layer when encoding edge texts; in node representation learning, we aggregate edge representations through an attention mechanism within each node’s ego-graph. On five public datasets from three different domains, Edgeformers consistently outperform state-of-the-art baselines in edge classification and link prediction, demonstrating the efficacy in learning edge and node representations, respectively",

We introduce a new multimodal 3D generative model that enables shape-conditioned 3D molecular design by equivariantly encoding molecular shape and variationally encoding chemical identity. We ensure local geometric and chemical validity of generated molecules by using autoregressive fragment-based generation with heuristic bonding geometries, allowing the model to prioritize the scoring of rotatable bonds to best align the growing conformation to the target shape. We evaluate our 3D generative model in tasks relevant to drug design including shape-conditioned generation of chemically diverse molecular structures and shape-constrained molecular property optimization, demonstrating its utility over virtual screening of enumerated libraries",

Among various approaches, exploiting invariant features by Domain Adversarial Training (DAT) received widespread attention. Despite its success, we observe training instability from DAT, mostly due to over-confident domain discriminator and environment label noise. To address this issue, we proposed Environment Label Smoothing (ELS), which encourages the discriminator to output soft probability, which thus reduces the confidence of the discriminator and alleviates the impact of noisy environment labels. We demonstrate, both experimentally and theoretically, that ELS can improve training stability, local convergence, and robustness to noisy environment labels. By incorporating ELS with DAT methods, we are able to yield state-of-art results on a wide range of domain generalization/adaptation tasks, particularly when the environment labels are highly noisy",

We consider block-wise, patch-wise, and channel group-wise local losses, and show that activity perturbation reduces variance compared to weight perturbation. Inspired by MLPMixer, we also propose a new architecture, LocalMixer, that is more suitable for local learning. We find local learning can work well with both supervised classification and self-supervised contrastive learning.

    "abstract": "The notion of neural collapse refers to several emergent phenomena that have been empirically observed across various canonical classification problems.  During the terminal phase of training a deep neural network, the feature embedding of all examples of the same class tend to collapse to a single representation, and the features of different classes tend to separate as much as possible. Neural collapse is often studied through a simplified model, called the layer-peeled model, in which the network is assumed to have ``infinite expressivity'' and can map each data point to any arbitrary representation. In this work we study a more realistic variant of the layer-peeled model, which takes the positivity of the features into account. Furthermore, we extend this model to also incorporate the limited expressivity of the network. Empirical evidence suggests that the memorization of noisy data points leads to a degradation (dilation) of the neural collapse. Using a model of the memorization-dilation (M-D) phenomenon, we show one mechanism by which different losses lead to different performances of the trained network on noisy data. Our proofs reveal why label smoothing, a modification of cross-entropy empirically observed to produce a regularization effect, leads to improved generalization in classification tasks",

However, existing CBMs and their variants have two crucial limitations:  first, they need to collect labeled data for each of the predefined concepts, which is time consuming and labor intensive; second, the accuracy of a CBM is often significantly lower than that of a standard neural network, especially on more complex datasets. This poor performance creates a barrier for adopting CBMs in practical real world applications. Motivated by these challenges, we propose Label-free CBM which is a novel framework to transform any neural network into an interpretable CBM without labeled concept data, while retaining a high accuracy. Our Label-free CBM has many advantages, it is: scalable - we present the first CBM scaled to ImageNet, efficient - creating a CBM takes only a few hours even for very large datasets, and automated - training it for a new dataset requires minimal human effort.

Specifically, we propose a new prompt-guided multi-task pre-training and fine-tuning framework, and the resulting protein model is called PromptProtein.

We also design a prompt fine-tuning module to provide downstream tasks the on-demand flexibility of utilizing respective levels of structure information.

Over the course of this effort, we face numerous unexpected technical and engineering challenges, particularly on loss spikes and divergence. In this paper, we introduce the pre-training process of GLM-130B including its design choices, training strategies for both efficiency and stability, and engineering efforts. The resultant GLM-130B model offers significant outperformance over GPT-3 175B on a wide range of popular English benchmarks while the performance advantage is not observed in OPT-175B and BLOOM-176B. It also consistently and significantly outperforms ERNIE TITAN 3.0 260B—the largest Chinese language model—across related benchmarks. Finally, we leverage a unique scaling property of GLM-130B to reach INT4 quantization with almost no performance loss, making it the first among 100B-scale models and more importantly, allowing its effective inference on 4×RTX 3090 (24G) or 8×RTX 2080 Ti (11G) GPUs, the most ever affordable GPUs required for using 100B-scale models.

    "title": "Causal Estimation for Text Data with (Apparent) Overlap Violations",
    "abstract": "Consider the problem of estimating the causal effect of some attribute of a text document; for example: what effect does writing a polite vs. rude email have on response time? To estimate a causal effect from observational data, we need to adjust for confounding aspects of the text that affect both the treatment and outcome---e.g., the topic or writing level of the text. These confounding aspects are unknown a priori, so it seems natural to adjust for the entirety of the text (e.g., using a transformer). However, causal identification and estimation procedures rely on the assumption of overlap: for all levels of the adjustment variables, there is randomness leftover so that every unit could have (not) received treatment. Since the treatment here is itself an attribute of the text, it is perfectly determined, and overlap is apparently violated. The purpose of this paper is to show how to handle causal identification and obtain robust causal estimation in the presence of apparent overlap violations. In brief, the idea is to use supervised representation learning to produce a data representation that preserves confounding information while eliminating information that is only predictive of the treatment. This representation then suffices for adjustment and satisfies overlap. Adapting results on non-parametric estimation, we show that this procedure shows robustness with respect to conditional outcome misestimation and yields a low-bias estimator that admits valid uncertainty quantification under weak conditions. Empirical results show reductions in bias and strong improvements in uncertainty quantification relative to the natural (transformer-based) baseline",

Model-based RL has the potential to be highly sample efficient by concurrently learning a world model and using synthetic rollouts for planning and policy improvement. However, in practice, sample-efficient learning with model-based RL is bottlenecked by the exploration challenge. In this work, we find that leveraging just a handful of demonstrations can dramatically improve the sample-efficiency of model-based RL. Simply appending demonstrations to the interaction dataset, however, does not suffice. We identify key ingredients for leveraging demonstrations in model learning -- policy pretraining, targeted exploration, and oversampling of demonstration data -- which forms the three phases of our model-based RL framework. We empirically study three complex visuo-motor control domains and find that our method is 160%-250% more successful in completing sparse reward tasks compared to prior approaches in the low data regime (100k interaction steps, 5 demonstrations).

Given a target event, our task is to find a subset of previously occurred events that lead to the model's prediction for it. To handle this combinatorial optimization problem, T-GNNExplainer includes an explorer to find the event subsets with Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)  and a navigator that learns the correlations between events and helps reduce the search space. In particular, the navigator is trained in advance and then integrated with the explorer to speed up searching and achieve better results. To the best of our knowledge, T-GNNExplainer is the first explainer tailored for temporal graph models. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the performance of T-GNNExplainer.

Our method employs a combination of value conservatism alongside an implicit dataset support constraint in learning value functions, which are then used to guide language model generations towards maximizing user-specified utility functions. In addition to empirically validating ILQL, we present a detailed empirical analysis of situations where offline RL can be useful in natural language generation settings, demonstrating how it can be a more effective utility optimizer than prior approaches for end-to-end dialogue, and how it can effectively optimize high variance reward functions based on subjective judgement, such as whether to label a comment as toxic or not",

    "title": "CLIPSep: Learning Text-queried Sound Separation with Noisy Unlabeled Videos",
    "abstract": "Recent years have seen progress beyond domain-specific sound separation for speech or music towards universal sound separation for arbitrary sounds. Prior work on universal sound separation has investigated separating a target sound out of an audio mixture given a text query. Such text-queried sound separation systems provide a natural and scalable interface for specifying arbitrary target sounds. However, supervised text-queried sound separation systems require costly labeled audio-text pairs for training. Moreover, the audio provided in existing datasets is often recorded in a controlled environment, causing a considerable generalization gap to noisy audio in the wild. In this work, we aim to approach text-queried universal sound separation by using only unlabeled data. We propose to leverage the visual modality as a bridge to learn the desired audio-textual correspondence. The proposed CLIPSep model first encodes the input query into a query vector using the contrastive language-image pretraining (CLIP) model, and the query vector is then used to condition an audio separation model to separate out the target sound. While the model is trained on image-audio pairs extracted from unlabeled videos, at test time we can instead query the model with text inputs in a zero-shot setting, thanks to the joint language-image embedding learned by the CLIP model. Further, videos in the wild often contain off-screen sounds and background noise that may hinder the model from learning the desired audio-textual correspondence. To address this problem, we further propose an approach called noise invariant training for training a query-based sound separation model on noisy data. Experimental results show that the proposed models successfully learn text-queried universal sound separation using only noisy unlabeled videos, even achieving competitive performance against a supervised model in some settings",

Self-play has proven useful in games such as Go, and thus it is natural to ask whether LMs can generate their own instructive programming problems to improve their performance. We show that it is possible for an LM to synthesize programming problems and solutions, which are filtered for correctness by a Python interpreter. The LM’s performance is then seen to improve when it is fine-tuned on its own synthetic problems and verified solutions; thus the model “improves itself” using the Python interpreter. Problems are specified formally as programming puzzles [Schuster et al. , 2021], a code-based problem format where solutions can easily be verified for correctness by execution. In experiments on publicly-available LMs, test accuracy more than doubles. This work demonstrates the potential for code LMs, with an interpreter, to generate instructive problems and improve their own performance",

    "abstract": "Reinforcement learning in partially observed Markov decision processes (POMDPs) faces two challenges. (i) It often takes the full history to predict the future, which induces a sample complexity that scales exponentially with the horizon. (ii) The observation and state spaces are often continuous, which induces a sample complexity that scales exponentially with the extrinsic dimension. Addressing such challenges requires learning a minimal but sufficient representation of the observation and state histories by exploiting the structure of the POMDP.\n\nTo this end, we propose a reinforcement learning algorithm named Represent to Control (RTC), which learns the representation at two levels while optimizing the policy.~(i) For each step, RTC learns to represent the state with a low-dimensional feature, which factorizes the transition kernel. (ii) Across multiple steps, RTC learns to represent the full history with a low-dimensional embedding, which assembles the per-step feature. We integrate (i) and (ii) in a unified framework that allows a variety of estimators (including maximum likelihood estimators and generative adversarial networks). For a class of POMDPs with a low-rank structure in the transition kernel, RTC attains an \nO\n(\n1\n/\nϵ\n2\n)\n sample complexity that scales polynomially with the horizon and the intrinsic dimension (that is, the rank). Here \nϵ\n is the optimality gap. To our best knowledge, RTC is the first sample-efficient algorithm that bridges representation learning and policy optimization in POMDPs with infinite observation and state spaces",

Recent state-of-the-art selective methods come with architectural changes either via introducing a separate selection head or an extra abstention logit. In this paper, we challenge the aforementioned methods. The results suggest that the superior performance of state-of-the-art methods is owed to training a more generalizable classifier rather than their proposed selection mechanisms. We argue that the best performing selection mechanism should instead be rooted in the classifier itself. Our proposed selection strategy uses the classification scores and achieves better results by a significant margin, consistently, across all coverages and all datasets, without any added compute cost. Furthermore, inspired by semi-supervised learning, we propose an entropy-based regularizer that improves the performance of selective classification methods. Our proposed selection mechanism with the proposed entropy-based regularizer achieves new state-of-the-art results",

In comparison, kernel bandits, which search for non-parametric functions in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS), offer higher modeling capacity. But the only existing work in distributed kernel bandits adopts a synchronous communication protocol, which greatly limits its practical use (e.g., every synchronization step requires all clients to participate and wait for data exchange).\nIn this paper, in order to improve the robustness against delays and unavailability of clients that are common in practice, we propose the first asynchronous solution based on approximated kernel regression for distributed kernel bandit learning. A set of effective treatments are developed to ensure approximation quality and communication efficiency. Rigorous theoretical analysis about the regret and communication cost is provided; and extensive empirical evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of our solution",

We propose a unified graph signal sampling framework which enjoys the benefits of graph signal analysis and processing. The key idea is to transform each user's ratings on the items to a function (signal) on the vertices of an item-item graph, then learn structural graph properties to recover the function from its values on certain vertices --- the problem of graph signal sampling. We propose a class of regularization functionals that takes into account discrete random label noise in the graph vertex domain, then develop the GS-IMC approach which biases the reconstruction towards functions that vary little between adjacent vertices for noise reduction. Theoretical result shows that accurate reconstructions can be achieved under mild conditions. For the online setting, we develop a Bayesian extension, i.e., BGS-IMC which considers continuous random Gaussian noise in the graph Fourier domain and builds upon a prediction-correction update algorithm to obtain the unbiased and minimum-variance reconstruction. Both GS-IMC and BGS-IMC have closed-form solutions and thus are highly scalable in large data. Experiments show that our methods achieve state-of-the-art performance on public benchmarks",

In contrast to previous practical tricks that address training instability by learning rate warmup, layer normalization, attention formulation, and weight initialization, we show that Lipschitz continuity is a more essential property to ensure training stability. In LipsFormer, we replace unstable Transformer component modules with Lipschitz continuous counterparts:  CenterNorm instead of LayerNorm, spectral initialization instead of Xavier initialization, scaled cosine similarity attention instead of dot-product attention, and weighted residual shortcut. We prove that these introduced modules are Lipschitz continuous and derive an upper bound on the Lipschitz constant of LipsFormer. Our experiments show that LipsFormer allows stable training of deep Transformer architectures without the need of careful learning rate tuning such as warmup, yielding a faster convergence and better generalization. As a result,  on the ImageNet 1K dataset, LipsFormer-Tiny training for 100 epochs without learning rate warmup attains a top-1 accuracy of 81.6\\% which is higher than Swin Transformer-Tiny training for 300 epochs with warmup.

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) can carry out complex reasoning tasks by generating intermediate reasoning steps. These steps are triggered by what is called chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting, which comes in two flavors: one leverages a simple prompt like \"Let’s think step by step\" to facilitate step-by-step reasoning before answering a question (Zero-Shot-CoT). The other uses manual demonstrations, each composed of a question and a reasoning chain that leads to an answer (Manual-CoT). Unfortunately, the superior performance of the latter strategy crucially hinges on manually generating task-specific demonstrations. This makes it far less scalable and more dependent on the talent of the CoT engineer. We show that such manual efforts may be eliminated by leveraging LLMs to generate the reasoning chains on its own. Since these generated chains often come with mistakes we propose a number of mitigation strategies. Our proposed Auto-CoT method automaticaly samples diverse questions and we perform post-processing quality control to generate usable reasoning chains from Zero-Shot-CoT. On ten public benchmark reasoning tasks, Auto-CoT performs on par with Manual-CoT without the need for human intervention. Code is available at https://github.com/amazon-research/auto-cot",

With the adoption of recent laws ensuring the \"right to be forgotten\", the problem of machine unlearning for FC methods has become of significant importance. We introduce, for the first time, the problem of machine unlearning for FC, and propose an efficient unlearning mechanism for a customized secure FC framework. Our FC framework utilizes special initialization procedures that we show are well-suited for unlearning. To protect client data privacy, we develop the secure compressed multiset aggregation (SCMA) framework that addresses sparse secure federated learning (FL) problems encountered during clustering as well as more general problems. To simultaneously facilitate low communication complexity and secret sharing protocols, we integrate Reed-Solomon encoding with special evaluation points into our SCMA pipeline, and prove that the client communication cost is logarithmic in the vector dimension. Additionally, to demonstrate the benefits of our unlearning mechanism over complete retraining, we provide a theoretical analysis for the unlearning performance of our approach. Simulation results show that the new FC framework exhibits superior clustering performance compared to previously reported FC baselines when the cluster sizes are highly imbalanced. Compared to completely retraining K-means++ locally and globally for each removal request, our unlearning procedure offers an average speed-up of roughly 84x across seven datasets.

    "title": "Moderate Coreset: A Universal Method of Data Selection for Real-world Data-efficient Deep Learning",
    "abstract": "Deep learning methods nowadays rely on massive data, resulting in substantial costs of data storage and model training. Data selection is a useful tool to alleviate such costs, where a coreset of massive data is extracted to practically perform on par with full data. Based on carefully-designed score criteria, existing methods first count the score of each data point and then select the data points whose scores lie in a certain range to construct a coreset. These methods work well in their respective preconceived scenarios but are not robust to the change of scenarios, since the optimal range of scores varies as the scenario changes. The issue limits the application of these methods, because realistic scenarios often mismatch preconceived ones, and it is inconvenient or unfeasible to tune the criteria and methods accordingly. In this paper, to address the issue, a concept of the moderate coreset is discussed. Specifically, given any score criterion of data selection, different scenarios prefer data points with scores in different intervals. As the score median is a proxy of the score distribution in statistics, the data points with scores close to the score median can be seen as a proxy of full data and generalize different scenarios, which are used to construct the moderate coreset. As a proof-of-concept, a universal method that inherits the moderate coreset and uses the distance of a data point to its class center as the score criterion, is proposed to meet complex realistic scenarios. Extensive experiments confirm the advance of our method over prior state-of-the-art methods, leading to a strong baseline for future research.

    "abstract": "To protect user privacy and meet legal regulations, federated learning (FL) is attracting significant attention. Training neural machine translation (NMT) models with traditional FL algorithm (e.g., FedAvg) typically relies on multi-round model-based interactions. However, it is impractical and inefficient for machine translation tasks due to the vast communication overheads and heavy synchronization. In this paper, we propose a novel federated nearest neighbor (FedNN) machine translation framework that, instead of multi-round model-based interactions, leverages one-round memorization-based interaction to share knowledge across different clients to build low-overhead privacy-preserving systems. The whole approach equips the public NMT model trained on large-scale accessible data with a \nk\n-nearest-neighbor (\nk\nNN) classifier and integrates the external datastore constructed by private text data in all clients to form the final FL model.  A two-phase datastore encryption strategy is introduced to achieve privacy-preserving during this process.  Extensive experiments show that FedNN significantly reduces computational and communication costs compared with FedAvg, while maintaining promising performance in different FL settings",

A no-worse optimal cost guarantee is developed as such the optimal solutions are not required to achieve for solvers, and we tackle the non-differentiable challenge in input instance disturbance by resorting to black-box adversarial attack methods. Extensive experiments are conducted on 14 unique combinations of solvers and CO problems, and we demonstrate that the performance of state-of-the-art solvers like Gurobi can degenerate by over 20% under the given time limit bound on the hard instances discovered by our robustness metric, raising concerns about the robustness of combinatorial optimization solvers",

    "abstract": "Human similarity judgments are a powerful supervision signal for machine learning applications based on techniques such as contrastive learning, information retrieval, and model alignment, but classical methods for collecting human similarity judgments are too expensive to be used at scale. Recent methods propose using pre-trained deep neural networks (DNNs) to approximate human similarity, but pre-trained DNNs may not be available for certain domains (e.g., medical images, low-resource languages) and their performance in approximating human similarity has not been extensively tested. We conducted an evaluation of 611 pre-trained models across three domains -- images, audio, video -- and found that there is a large gap in performance between human similarity judgments and pre-trained DNNs. To address this gap, we propose a new class of similarity approximation methods based on language. To collect the language data required by these new methods, we also developed and validated a novel adaptive tag collection pipeline. We find that our proposed language-based methods are significantly cheaper, in the number of human judgments, than classical methods, but still improve performance over the DNN-based methods. Finally, we also develop `stacked' methods that combine language embeddings with DNN embeddings, and find that these consistently provide the best approximations for human similarity across all three of our modalities. Based on the results of this comprehensive study, we provide a concise guide for researchers interested in collecting or approximating human similarity data. To accompany this guide, we also release all of the similarity and language data, a total of 206,339 human judgments, that we collected in our experiments, along with a detailed breakdown of all modeling results",

However, we argue that existing methods might fail to utilize the unlabeled data more effectively since they either use a pre-defined / fixed threshold or an ad-hoc threshold adjusting scheme, resulting in inferior performance and slow convergence. We first analyze a motivating example to obtain intuitions on the relationship between the desirable threshold and model's learning status. Based on the analysis, we hence propose FreeMatch to adjust the confidence threshold in a self-adaptive manner according to the model's learning status. We further introduce a self-adaptive class fairness regularization penalty to encourage the model for diverse predictions during the early training stage. Extensive experiments indicate the superiority of FreeMatch especially when the labeled data are extremely rare. FreeMatch achieves 5.78%, 13.59%, and 1.28% error rate reduction over the latest state-of-the-art method FlexMatch on CIFAR-10 with 1 label per class, STL-10 with 4 labels per class, and ImageNet with 100 labels per class, respectively.

To address these issues, we propose an alternative spectral method, Spectral Decomposition Representation (SPEDER), that extracts a state-action abstraction from the dynamics without inducing spurious dependence on the data collection policy, while also balancing the exploration-versus-exploitation trade-off during learning.

    "abstract": "Communication is important in many multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) problems for agents to share information and make good decisions. However, when deploying trained communicative agents in a real-world application where noise and potential attackers exist, the safety of communication-based policies becomes a severe issue that is underexplored. Specifically, if communication messages are manipulated by malicious attackers, agents relying on untrustworthy communication may take unsafe actions that lead to catastrophic consequences. Therefore, it is crucial to ensure that agents will not be misled by corrupted communication, while still benefiting from benign communication. In this work, we consider an environment with \nN\n agents, where the attacker may arbitrarily change the communication from any \nC\n<\nN\n−\n1\n2\n agents to a victim agent. For this strong threat model, we propose a certifiable defense by constructing a message-ensemble policy that aggregates multiple randomly ablated message sets. Theoretical analysis shows that this message-ensemble policy can utilize benign communication while being certifiably robust to adversarial communication, regardless of the attacking algorithm. Experiments in multiple environments verify that our defense significantly improves the robustness of trained policies against various types of attacks",

    "abstract": "A number of competing hypotheses have been proposed to explain why small-batch Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) leads to improved generalization over the full-batch regime, with recent work crediting the implicit regularization of various quantities throughout training. However, to date, empirical evidence assessing the explanatory power of these hypotheses is lacking. In this paper, we conduct an extensive empirical evaluation, focusing on the ability of various theorized mechanisms to close the small-to-large batch generalization gap. Additionally, we characterize how the quantities that SGD has been claimed to (implicitly) regularize change over the course of training. By using micro-batches, i.e. disjoint smaller subsets of each mini-batch, we empirically show that explicitly penalizing the gradient norm or the Fisher Information Matrix trace, averaged over micro-batches, in the large-batch regime recovers small-batch SGD generalization, whereas Jacobian-based regularizations fail to do so. This generalization performance is shown to often be correlated with how well the regularized model’s gradient norms resemble those of small-batch SGD. We additionally show that this behavior breaks down as the micro-batch size approaches the batch size. Finally, we note that in this line of inquiry, positive experimental findings on CIFAR10 are often reversed on other datasets like CIFAR100, highlighting the need to test hypotheses on a wider collection of datasets",

We propose a feature selection algorithm called Sequential Attention that achieves state-of-the-art empirical results for neural networks. This algorithm is based on an efficient one-pass implementation of greedy forward selection and uses attention weights at each step as a proxy for feature importance. We give theoretical insights into our algorithm for linear regression by showing that an adaptation to this setting is equivalent to the classical Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (OMP) algorithm, and thus inherits all of its provable guarantees.

Though state-of-the-art models can generate high-quality images of common entities, they often have difficulty generating images of uncommon entities, such as `Chortai (dog)' or `Picarones (food)'. To tackle this issue, we present the Retrieval-Augmented Text-to-Image Generator (Re-Imagen), a generative model that uses retrieved information to produce high-fidelity and faithful images, even for rare or unseen entities. Given a text prompt, Re-Imagen accesses an external multi-modal knowledge base to retrieve relevant (image, text) pairs, and uses them as references to generate the image. With this retrieval step, Re-Imagen is augmented with the knowledge of high-level semantics and low-level visual details of the mentioned entities, and thus improves its accuracy in generating the entities' visual appearances. We train Re-Imagen on a constructed dataset containing (image,text,retrieval) triples to teach the model to ground on both text prompt and retrieval. Furthermore, we develop a new sampling strategy to interleave the classifier-free guidance for text and retrieval condition to balance the text and retrieval alignment. Re-Imagen achieves new SoTA FID results on two image generation benchmarks, such as COCO (\\ie, FID = 5.25) and WikiImage (\\ie, FID = 5.82) without fine-tuning. To further evaluate the capabilities of the model, we introduce EntityDrawBench, a new benchmark that evaluates image generation for diverse entities, from frequent to rare, across multiple visual domains. Human evaluation on EntityDrawBench shows that Re-Imagen performs on par with the best prior models in photo-realism, but with significantly better real-world faithfulness, especially on less frequent entities",

The goal of the agent is to learn a multi-task policy based on a linear representation while solving a sequence of tasks that may be adaptively chosen based on the agent's past behaviors. We frame the problem as a linearly parameterized contextual Markov decision process (MDP), where each task is specified by a context and the transition dynamics is context-independent, and we introduce a new completeness-style assumption on the representation which is sufficient to ensure the optimal multi-task policy is realizable under the linear representation. Under this assumption, we propose an algorithm, called UCB Lifelong Value Distillation (UCBlvd), that provably achieves sublinear regret for any sequence of tasks while using only sublinear planning calls.

    "title": "Link Prediction with Non-Contrastive Learning",
    "abstract": "Graph neural networks (GNNs) are prominent in the graph machine learning domain, owing to their strong performance across various tasks. A recent focal area is the space of graph self-supervised learning (SSL), which aims to derive useful node representations without labeled data. Notably, many state-of-the-art graph SSL methods are contrastive methods, which use a combination of positive and negative samples to learn node representations. Owing to challenges in negative sampling (slowness and model sensitivity), recent literature introduced non-contrastive methods, which instead only use positive samples. Though such methods have shown promising performance in node-level tasks, their suitability for link prediction tasks, which are concerned with predicting link existence between pairs of nodes (and have broad applicability to recommendation systems contexts) is yet unexplored. In this work, we extensively evaluate the performance of existing non-contrastive methods for link prediction in both transductive and inductive settings. While most existing non-contrastive methods perform poorly overall, we find that, surprisingly, BGRL generally performs well in transductive settings. However, it performs poorly in the more realistic inductive settings where the model has to generalize to links to/from unseen nodes. We find that non-contrastive models tend to overfit to the training graph and use this analysis to propose T-BGRL, a novel non-contrastive framework that incorporates cheap corruptions to improve the generalization ability of the model. This simple modification strongly improves inductive performance in 5/6 of our datasets, with up to a 120% improvement in Hits@50 - all with comparable speed to other non-contrastive baselines, and up to \n14\n×\n faster than the best-performing contrastive baseline. Our work imparts interesting findings about non-contrastive learning for link prediction and paves the way for future researchers to further expand upon this area",

    "title": "Distributed Differential Privacy in Multi-Armed Bandits",
    "abstract": "We consider the standard \nK\n-armed bandit problem under a distributed trust model of differential privacy (DP), which enables to guarantee privacy without a trustworthy server.  Under this trust model, previous work largely focus on achieving privacy using a shuffle protocol, where a batch of users data are randomly permuted before sending to a central server. This protocol achieves (\nϵ\n,\nδ\n) or approximate-DP guarantee by sacrificing an additive \nO\n(\nK\nlog\n⁡\nT\nlog\n⁡\n(\n1\n/\nδ\n)\nϵ\n)\n factor in \nT\n-step cumulative regret. In contrast, the optimal privacy cost to achieve a stronger (\nϵ\n,\n0\n) or pure-DP guarantee under the widely used central trust model is only \nΘ\n(\nK\nlog\n⁡\nT\nϵ\n)\n, where, however, a trusted server is required. In this work, we aim to obtain a pure-DP guarantee under distributed trust model while sacrificing no more regret than that under central trust model. We achieve this by designing a generic bandit algorithm based on successive arm elimination, where privacy is guaranteed by corrupting rewards with an equivalent discrete Laplace noise ensured by a secure computation protocol. We also show that our algorithm, when instantiated with Skellam noise and the secure protocol, ensures \\emph{R\\'{e}nyi differential privacy} -- a stronger notion than approximate DP -- under distributed trust model with a privacy cost of \nO\n(\nK\nlog\n⁡\nT\nϵ\n)\n. Finally, as a by-product of our techniques, we also recover the best-known regret bounds for bandits under central and local models while using only \\emph{discrete privacy noise}, which can avoid the privacy leakage due to floating point arithmetic of continuous noise on finite computers",

    "abstract": "Contrastive learning is a powerful framework for learning self-supervised representations that generalize well to downstream supervised tasks. We show that multiple existing contrastive learning methods can be reinterpeted as learning kernel functions that approximate a fixed *positive-pair kernel*. We then prove that a simple representation obtained by combining this kernel with PCA provably minimizes the worst-case approximation error of linear predictors, under a straightforward assumption that positive pairs have similar labels. Our analysis is based on a decomposition of the target function in terms of the eigenfunctions of a positive-pair Markov chain, and a surprising equivalence between these eigenfunctions and the output of Kernel PCA. We give generalization bounds for downstream linear prediction using our kernel PCA representation, and show empirically on a set of synthetic tasks that applying kernel PCA to contrastive learning models can indeed approximately recover the Markov chain eigenfunctions, although the accuracy depends on the kernel parameterization as well as on the augmentation strength",

    "title": "Provably Auditing Ordinary Least Squares in Low Dimensions",
    "abstract": "Auditing the stability of a machine learning model to small changes in the training procedure is critical for engendering trust in practical applications. For example, a model should not be overly sensitive to removing a small fraction of its training data. However, algorithmically validating this property seems computationally challenging, even for the simplest of models: Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) linear regression. Concretely, recent work defines the stability of a regression as the minimum number of samples that need to be removed so that rerunning the analysis overturns the conclusion (Broderick et al., 2020), specifically meaning that the sign of a particular coefficient of the OLS regressor changes. But the only known approach for estimating this metric, besides the obvious exponential-time algorithm, is a greedy heuristic that may produce severe overestimates and therefore cannot certify stability. We show that stability can be efficiently certified in the low-dimensional regime: when the number of covariates is a constant but the number of samples is large, there are polynomial-time algorithms for estimating (a fractional version of) stability, with provable approximation guarantees. Applying our algorithms to the Boston Housing dataset, we exhibit regression analyses where our estimator outperforms the greedy heuristic, and can successfully certify stability even in the regime where a constant fraction of the samples are dropped",

    "abstract": "Temporal networks model a variety of important phenomena involving timed interactions between entities. Existing methods for machine learning on temporal networks generally exhibit at least one of two limitations. First, many methods assume time to be discretized, so if the time data is continuous, the user must determine the discretization and discard precise time information. Second, edge representations can only be calculated indirectly from the nodes, which may be suboptimal for tasks like edge classification. We present a simple method that avoids both shortcomings: construct the line graph of the network, which includes a node for each interaction, and weigh the edges of this graph based on the difference in time between interactions. From this derived graph, edge representations for the original network can be computed with efficient classical methods. The simplicity of this approach facilitates explicit theoretical analysis: we can constructively show the effectiveness of our method's representations for a natural synthetic model of temporal networks. Empirical results on real-world networks demonstrate our method's efficacy and efficiency on both link classification and prediction",

Due to its NP-hard nature, heuristic algorithms were traditionally used to acquire reasonably good solutions, and more recent works have proposed Machine Learning (ML) heuristics that can generalize to unseen graphs and outperform the non-ML heuristics. However, it is computationally costly to generate solutions using existing ML schedulers since they adopt the episodic reinforcement learning framework that necessitates multi-round neural network processing. We propose a novel ML scheduler that uses a one-shot neural network encoder to sample node priorities which are converted by list scheduling to the final schedules. Since the one-shot encoder can efficiently sample the priorities in parallel, our algorithm runs significantly faster than existing ML baselines and has comparable run time with the fast traditional heuristics. We empirically show that our algorithm generates better schedules than both non-neural and neural baselines across various real-world and synthetic scheduling tasks",

In this work, we propose a new approach: we measure the performance of a collection of models when evaluated at *single input point*. Specifically, we study a point's *profile*: the relationship between models' average performance on the test distribution and their pointwise performance on this individual point. We find that profiles can yield new insights into the structure of both models and data---in and out-of-distribution. For example, we empirically show that real data distributions consist of points with qualitatively different profiles. On one hand, there are ``compatible'' points with strong correlation between the pointwise and average performance. On the other hand, there are points with weak and even *negative* correlation: cases where improving overall model accuracy actually *hurts* performance on these inputs. As an application, we use profiles to construct a dataset we call CIFAR-10-NEG: a subset of CINIC-10 such that for standard models, accuracy on CIFAR-10-NEG is *negatively correlated* with CIFAR-10 accuracy.

    "title": "Diffusion Models for Causal Discovery via Topological Ordering",
    "abstract": "Discovering causal relations from observational data becomes possible with additional assumptions such as considering the functional relations to be constrained as nonlinear with additive noise (ANM). Even with strong assumptions, causal discovery involves an expensive search problem over the space of directed acyclic graphs (DAGs). \\emph{Topological ordering} approaches reduce the optimisation space of causal discovery by searching over a permutation rather than graph space.\nFor ANMs, the \\emph{Hessian} of the data log-likelihood can be used for finding leaf nodes in a causal graph, allowing its topological ordering. However, existing computational methods for obtaining the Hessian still do not scale as the number of variables and the number of samples are increased. Therefore, inspired by recent innovations in diffusion probabilistic models (DPMs), we propose \\emph{DiffAN}, a topological ordering algorithm that leverages DPMs for learning a Hessian function. We introduce theory for updating the learned Hessian without re-training the neural network, and we show that computing with a subset of samples gives an accurate approximation of the ordering, which allows scaling to datasets with more samples and variables. We show empirically that our method scales exceptionally well to datasets with up to \n500\n nodes and up to \n10\n5\n samples while still performing on par over small datasets with state-of-the-art causal discovery methods.\nImplementation is available at \\url{https://github.com/vios-s/DiffAN}",

Our model first detects phrases as the semantic unit and aligns corresponding phrases in the two sentences. Then, the model predicts the NLI label for the aligned phrases, and induces the sentence label by fuzzy logic formulas. Our EPR is almost everywhere differentiable and thus the system can be trained end to end. In this way, we are able to provide explicit explanations of phrasal logical relationships in a weakly supervised manner.

We then propose an extended DCI-ES framework with two new measures of representation quality—explicitness (E) and size (S)—and point out how D and C can be computed for black-box predictors. Our main idea is that the functional capacity required to use a representation is an important but thus-far neglected aspect of representation quality, which we quantify using explicitness or ease-of-use (E).

We consider finite-sum federated optimization under a second-order function similarity condition and strong convexity, and propose two new algorithms: SVRP and Catalyzed SVRP. This second-order similarity condition has grown popular recently, and is satisfied in many applications including distributed statistical learning and differentially private empirical risk minimization. The first algorithm, SVRP, combines approximate stochastic proximal point evaluations, client sampling, and variance reduction. We show that SVRP is communication efficient and achieves superior performance to many existing algorithms when function similarity is high enough. Our second algorithm, Catalyzed SVRP, is a Catalyst-accelerated variant of SVRP that achieves even better performance and uniformly improves upon existing algorithms for federated optimization under second-order similarity and strong convexity. In the course of analyzing these algorithms, we provide a new analysis of the Stochastic Proximal Point Method (SPPM) that might be of independent interest. Our analysis of SPPM is simple, allows for approximate proximal point evaluations, does not require any smoothness assumptions, and shows a clear benefit in communication complexity over ordinary distributed stochastic gradient descent",

We propose a novel Mutual Learning based PLL approach named ML-PLL to address this challenging problem. ML-PLL learns a prediction network based classifier and a class-prototype based classifier cooperatively through interactive mutual learning and label correction. Moreover, we use a transformation network to model the association relationships between the true label and candidate labels, and learn it together with the prediction network to match the observed candidate labels in the training data and enhance label correction.

Recently, many works present lots of special methods for applying deep neural networks to KT from different perspectives like model architecture, adversarial augmentation and etc., which make the overall algorithm and system become more and more complex. Furthermore, due to the lack of standardized evaluation protocol \\citep{liu2022pykt}, there is no widely agreed KT baselines and published experimental comparisons become inconsistent and self-contradictory, i.e., the reported AUC scores of DKT on ASSISTments2009 range from 0.721 to 0.821 \\citep{minn2018deep,yeung2018addressing}. Therefore, in this paper, we provide a strong but simple baseline method to deal with the KT task named \\textsc{simpleKT}. Inspired by the Rasch model in psychometrics, we explicitly model question-specific variations to capture the individual differences among questions covering the same set of knowledge components that are a generalization of terms of concepts or skills needed for learners to accomplish steps in a task or a problem. Furthermore, instead of using sophisticated representations to capture student forgetting behaviors, we use the ordinary dot-product attention function to extract the time-aware information embedded in the student learning interactions. Extensive experiments show that such a simple baseline is able to always rank top 3 in terms of AUC scores and achieve 57 wins, 3 ties and 16 loss against 12 DLKT baseline methods on 7 public datasets of different domains.

Thus, we present a parameter-efficient fine-tuning design paradigm and discover design patterns that are applicable to different experimental settings. Instead of focusing on designing another individual tuning strategy, we introduce parameter-efficient fine-tuning design spaces that parameterize tuning structures and tuning strategies. Specifically, any design space is characterized by four components: layer grouping, trainable parameter allocation, tunable groups, and strategy assignment. Our comprehensive empirical study leads to the discovery of design patterns: (i) grouping layers in a spindle pattern, (ii) uniformly allocating the number of trainable parameters to layers, (ii) tuning all the groups, and (iv) tuning different groups with proper strategies. Our discovered design patterns result in new parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods.

    "abstract": "A well-known failure mode of neural networks is that they may confidently return erroneous predictions. Such unsafe behaviour is particularly frequent when the use case slightly differs from the training context, and/or in the presence of an adversary. This work presents a novel direction to address these issues in a broad, general manner: imposing class-aware constraints on a model's internal activation patterns. Specifically, we assign to each class a unique, fixed, randomly-generated binary vector - hereafter called class code - and train the model so that its cross-depths activation patterns predict the appropriate class code according to the input sample's class. The resulting predictors are dubbed total activation classifiers (TAC), and TACs may either be trained from scratch, or used with negligible cost as a thin add-on on top of a frozen, pre-trained neural network. The distance between a TAC's activation pattern and the closest valid code acts as an additional confidence score, besides the default unTAC'ed prediction head's. In the add-on case, the original neural network's inference head is completely unaffected (so its accuracy remains the same) but we now have the option to use TAC's own confidence and prediction when determining which course of action to take in an hypothetical production workflow. In particular, we show that TAC strictly improves the value derived from models allowed to reject/defer. We provide further empirical evidence that TAC works well on multiple types of architectures and data modalities and that it is at least as good as state-of-the-art alternative confidence scores derived from existing models",

In this paper, we propose TILP, a differentiable framework for temporal logical rules learning. By designing a constrained random walk mechanism and the introduction of temporal operators, we ensure the efficiency of our model. We present temporal features modeling in tKG, e.g., recurrence, temporal order, interval between pair of relations, and duration, and incorporate it into our learning process. We compare TILP with state-of-the-art methods on two benchmark datasets. We show that our proposed framework can improve upon the performance of baseline methods while providing interpretable results. In particular, we consider various scenarios in which training samples are limited, data is biased, and the time range between training and inference are different. In all these cases, TILP works much better than the state-of-the-art methods",

    "title": "Revisiting the Assumption of Latent Separability for Backdoor Defenses",
    "abstract": "Recent studies revealed that deep learning is susceptible to backdoor poisoning attacks. An adversary can embed a hidden backdoor into a model to manipulate its predictions by only modifying a few training data, without controlling the training process. Currently, a tangible signature has been widely observed across a diverse set of backdoor poisoning attacks --- models trained on a poisoned dataset tend to learn separable latent representations for poison and clean samples. This latent separation is so pervasive that a family of backdoor defenses directly take it as a default assumption (dubbed latent separability assumption), based on which to identify poison samples via cluster analysis in the latent space. An intriguing question consequently follows: is the latent separation unavoidable for backdoor poisoning attacks? This question is central to understanding whether the assumption of latent separability provides a reliable foundation for defending against backdoor poisoning attacks. In this paper, we design adaptive backdoor poisoning attacks to present counter-examples against this assumption. Our methods include two key components: (1) a set of trigger-planted samples correctly labeled to their semantic classes (other than the target class) that can regularize backdoor learning; (2) asymmetric trigger planting strategies that help to boost attack success rate (ASR) as well as to diversify latent representations of poison samples. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets verify the effectiveness of our adaptive attacks in bypassing existing latent separation based backdoor defenses. Moreover, our attacks still maintain a high attack success rate with negligible clean accuracy drop. Our studies call for defense designers to take caution when leveraging latent separation as an assumption in their defenses.

While there exist influential results on the problem from the ``near initialization'' perspective, we shed considerable new light on the problem. In particular, we make two key technical contributions for such models with \nL\n layers, \nm\n width, and \nσ\n0\n2\n initialization variance. First, for suitable \nσ\n0\n2\n, we establish a \nO\n(\npoly\n(\nL\n)\nm\n)\n upper bound on the spectral norm of the Hessian of such models, considerably sharpening prior results. Second, we introduce a new analysis of optimization based on Restricted Strong Convexity (RSC) which holds as long as the squared norm of the average gradient of predictors is \nΩ\n(\npoly\n(\nL\n)\nm\n)\n for the square loss. We also present results for more general losses. The RSC based analysis does not need the ``near initialization\" perspective and guarantees geometric convergence for gradient descent (GD). To the best of our knowledge, ours is the first result on establishing geometric convergence of GD based on RSC for deep learning models, thus becoming an alternative sufficient condition for convergence that does not depend on the widely-used Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK).

    "abstract": "Given a graph learning task, such as link prediction, on a new graph, how can we select the best method as well as its hyperparameters (collectively called a model) without having to train or evaluate any model on the new graph? Model selection for graph learning has been largely ad hoc. A typical approach has been to apply popular methods to new datasets, but this is often suboptimal. On the other hand, systematically comparing models on the new graph quickly becomes too costly, or even impractical. In this work, we develop the first meta-learning approach for evaluation-free graph learning model selection, called MetaGL, which utilizes the prior performances of existing methods on various benchmark graph datasets to automatically select an effective model for the new graph, without any model training or evaluations. To quantify similarities across a wide variety of graphs, we introduce specialized meta-graph features that capture the structural characteristics of a graph. Then we design G-M network, which represents the relations among graphs and models, and develop a graph-based meta-learner operating on this G-M network, which estimates the relevance of each model to different graphs. Extensive experiments show that using MetaGL to select a model for the new graph greatly outperforms several existing meta-learning techniques tailed for graph learning model selection (up to 47% better), while being extremely fast at test time (∼1 sec)",

    "abstract": "Model-based methods have recently shown great potential for off-policy evaluation (OPE); offline trajectories induced by behavioral policies are fitted to transitions of Markov decision processes (MDPs), which are used to rollout simulated trajectories and estimate the performance of policies. Model-based OPE methods face two key challenges. First, as offline trajectories are usually fixed, they tend to cover limited state and action space. Second, the performance of model-based methods can be sensitive to the initialization of their parameters. In this work, we propose the variational latent branching model (VLBM) to learn the transition function of MDPs by formulating the environmental dynamics as a compact latent space, from which the next states and rewards are then sampled. Specifically, VLBM leverages and extends the variational inference framework with the recurrent state alignment (RSA), which is designed to capture as much information underlying the limited training data, by smoothing out the information flow between the variational (encoding) and generative (decoding) part of VLBM. Moreover, we also introduce the branching architecture to improve the model’s robustness against randomly initialized model weights. The effectiveness of the VLBM is evaluated on the deep OPE (DOPE) benchmark, from which the training trajectories are designed to result in varied coverage of the state-action space. We show that the VLBM outperforms existing state-of-the-art OPE methods in general",

    "abstract": "The ability to jointly learn from multiple modalities, such as text, audio, and visual data, is a defining feature of intelligent systems. While there have been promising advances in designing neural networks to harness multimodal data, the enormous success of data augmentation currently remains limited to single-modality tasks like image classification. Indeed, it is particularly difficult to augment each modality while preserving the overall semantic structure of the data; for example, a caption may no longer be a good description of an image after standard augmentations have been applied, such as translation. Moreover, it is challenging to specify reasonable transformations that are not tailored to a particular modality. In this paper, we introduce LeMDA, Learning Multimodal Data Augmentation, an easy-to-use method that automatically learns to jointly augment multimodal data in feature space, with no constraints on the identities of the modalities or the relationship between modalities. We show that LeMDA can (1) profoundly improve the performance of multimodal deep learning architectures, (2) apply to combinations of modalities that have not been previously considered, and (3) achieve state-of-the-art results on a wide range of applications comprised of image, text, and tabular data",

Imitation learning concerns an imitator learning to behave in an unknown environment from an expert's demonstration; reward signals remain latent to the imitator. This paper studies imitation learning through causal lenses and extends the analysis and tools developed for behavior cloning (Zhang, Kumor, Bareinboim, 2020) to inverse reinforcement learning. First, we propose novel graphical conditions that allow the imitator to learn a policy performing as well as the expert's behavior policy, even when the imitator and the expert's state-action space disagree, and unobserved confounders (UCs) are present. When provided with parametric knowledge about the unknown reward function, such a policy may outperform the expert's. Also, our method is easily extensible and allows one to leverage existing IRL algorithms even when UCs are present, including the multiplicative-weights algorithm (MWAL) (Syed & Schapire, 2008) and the generative adversarial imitation learning (GAIL) (Ho & Ermon, 2016).

    "abstract": "To reduce the human annotation efforts, the programmatic weak supervision (PWS) paradigm abstracts weak supervision sources as labeling functions (LFs) and involves a label model to aggregate the output of multiple LFs to produce training labels. Most existing label models require a parameter learning step for each dataset. In this work, we present a hyper label model that (once learned) infers the ground-truth labels for each dataset in a single forward pass without dataset-specific parameter learning. The hyper label model approximates an optimal analytical (yet computationally intractable) solution of the ground-truth labels. We train the model on synthetic data generated in the way that ensures the model approximates the analytical optimal solution, and build the model upon Graph Neural Network (GNN) to ensure the model prediction being invariant (or equivariant) to the permutation of LFs (or data points). On 14 real-world datasets, our hyper label model outperforms the best existing methods in both accuracy (by 1.4 points on average) and efficiency (by six times on average).

    "title": "FedFA: Federated Feature Augmentation",
    "abstract": "Federated learning is a distributed paradigm that allows multiple parties to collaboratively train deep models without exchanging the raw data. However, the data distribution among clients is naturally non-i.i.d., which leads to severe degradation of the learnt model. The primary goal of this paper is to develop a robust federated learning algorithm to address feature shift in clients’ samples, which can be caused by various factors, e.g., acquisition differences in medical imaging. To reach this goal, we propose FedFA to tackle federated learning from a dis- tinct perspective of federated feature augmentation. FedFA is based on a major insight that each client’s data distribution can be characterized by statistics (i.e., mean and standard deviation) of latent features; and it is likely to manipulate these local statistics globally, i.e., based on information in the entire federation, to let clients have a better sense of the underlying distribution and therefore alleviate local data bias. Based on this insight, we propose to augment each local feature statistic probabilistically based on a normal distribution, whose mean is the original statistic and variance quantifies the augmentation scope. Key to our approach is the determination of a meaningful Gaussian variance, which is accomplished by taking into account not only biased data of each individual client, but also underlying feature statistics characterized by all participating clients. We offer both theoretical and empirical justifications to verify the effectiveness of FedFA. Our code is available at https://github.com/tfzhou/FedFA",

    "abstract": "This paper investigates when one can efficiently recover an approximate Nash Equilibrium (NE) in offline congestion games. The existing dataset coverage assumption in offline general-sum games inevitably incurs a dependency on the number of actions, which can be exponentially large in congestion games. We consider three different types of feedback with decreasing revealed information. Starting from the facility-level (a.k.a., semi-bandit) feedback, we propose a novel one-unit deviation coverage condition and show a pessimism-type algorithm that can recover an approximate NE. For the agent-level (a.k.a., bandit) feedback setting, interestingly, we show the one-unit deviation coverage condition is not sufficient. On the other hand, we convert the game to multi-agent linear bandits and show that with a generalized data coverage assumption in offline linear bandits, we can efficiently recover the approximate NE. Lastly, we consider a novel type of feedback, the game-level feedback where only the total reward from all agents is revealed. Again, we show the coverage assumption for the agent-level feedback setting is insufficient in the game-level feedback setting, and with a stronger version of the data coverage assumption for linear bandits, we can recover an approximate NE. Together, our results constitute the first study of offline congestion games and imply formal separations between different types of feedback",

    "abstract": "The success of machine learning relies heavily on massive amounts of data, which are usually generated and stored across a range of diverse and distributed data sources. Decentralized learning has thus been advocated and widely deployed to make efficient use of distributed datasets, with an extensive focus on supervised learning (SL) problems. Unfortunately, the majority of real-world data are unlabeled and can be highly heterogeneous across sources. In this work, we carefully study decentralized learning with unlabeled data through the lens of self-supervised learning (SSL), specifically contrastive visual representation learning. We study the effectiveness of a range of contrastive learning algorithms under a decentralized learning setting, on relatively large-scale datasets including ImageNet-100, MS-COCO, and a new real-world robotic warehouse dataset. Our experiments show that the decentralized SSL (Dec-SSL) approach is robust to the heterogeneity of decentralized datasets, and learns useful representation for object classification, detection, and segmentation tasks, even when combined with the simple and standard decentralized learning algorithm of Federated Averaging (FedAvg). This robustness makes it possible to significantly reduce communication and to reduce the participation ratio of data sources with only minimal drops in performance. Interestingly, using the same amount of data, the representation learned by Dec-SSL can not only perform on par with that learned by centralized SSL which requires communication and excessive data storage costs, but also sometimes outperform representations extracted from decentralized SL which requires extra knowledge about the data labels. Finally, we provide theoretical insights into understanding why data heterogeneity is less of a concern for Dec-SSL objectives, and introduce feature alignment and clustering techniques to develop a new Dec-SSL algorithm that further improves the performance, in the face of highly non-IID data. Our study presents positive evidence to embrace unlabeled data in decentralized learning, and we hope to provide new insights into whether and why decentralized SSL is effective and/or even advantageous",

    "abstract": "The robustness of a deep classifier can be characterized by its margins: the decision boundary's distances to natural data points. However, it is unclear whether existing robust training methods effectively increase the margin for each vulnerable point during training. To understand this, we propose a continuous-time framework for quantifying the relative speed of the decision boundary with respect to each individual point. Through visualizing the moving speed of the decision boundary under Adversarial Training, one of the most effective robust training algorithms, a surprising moving-behavior is revealed: the decision boundary moves away from some vulnerable points but simultaneously moves closer to others, decreasing their margins. To alleviate these conflicting dynamics of the decision boundary, we propose Dynamics-aware Robust Training (DyART), which encourages the decision boundary to engage in movement that prioritizes increasing smaller margins. In contrast to prior works, DyART directly operates on the margins rather than their indirect approximations, allowing for more targeted and effective robustness improvement. Experiments on the CIFAR-10 and Tiny-ImageNet datasets verify that DyART alleviates the conflicting dynamics of the decision boundary and obtains improved robustness under various perturbation sizes compared to the state-of-the-art defenses.

Candidate sentences are also compared to sentences in the source documents to allow grounding (e.g., factuality) evaluation.

The latter does not use any neural model, which is useful during model development phases where resources can be limited and fast evaluation is required.

    "abstract": "Machine learning models exhibit two seemingly contradictory phenomena: training data memorization and various forms of forgetting. In memorization, models overfit specific training examples and become susceptible to privacy attacks. In forgetting, examples which appeared early in training are forgotten by the end. In this work, we connect these phenomena.\nWe propose a technique to measure to what extent models ``forget'' the specifics of training examples, becoming less susceptible to privacy attacks on examples they have not seen recently.\nWe show that, while non-convexity can prevent forgetting from happening in the worst-case, standard image,speech, and language models empirically do forget examples over time.\nWe identify nondeterminism as a potential explanation, showing that deterministically trained models do not forget.\nOur results suggest that examples seen early when training with extremely large datasets---for instance those examples used to pre-train a model---may observe privacy benefits at the expense of examples seen later",

    "abstract": "The ability to predict future visual observations conditioned on past observations and motor commands can enable embodied agents to plan solutions to a variety of tasks in complex environments. This work shows that we can create good video prediction models by pre-training transformers via masked visual modeling. Our approach, named MaskViT, is based on two simple design decisions. First, for memory and training efficiency, we use two types of window attention: spatial and spatiotemporal. Second, during training, we mask a variable percentage of tokens instead of a fixed mask ratio. For inference, MaskViT generates all tokens via iterative refinement where we incrementally decrease the masking ratio following a mask scheduling function. On several datasets we demonstrate that MaskViT outperforms prior works in video prediction, is parameter efficient, and can generate high resolution videos (\n256\n×\n256). Further, we demonstrate the benefits of inference speedup (up to \n512\n×\n) due to iterative decoding by using MaskViT for planning on a real robot. Our work suggests that we can endow embodied agents with powerful predictive models by leveraging the general framework of masked visual modeling with minimal domain knowledge",

    "title": "Text Summarization with Oracle Expectation",
    "abstract": "Extractive summarization produces summaries by identifying and concatenating the most important sentences in a document. Since most summarization datasets do not come with gold labels indicating whether document sentences are summary-worthy, different labeling algorithms have been proposed to extrapolate oracle extracts for model training. In this work, we identify two flaws with the widely used greedy labeling approach: it delivers suboptimal and deterministic oracles. To alleviate both issues, we propose a simple yet effective labeling algorithm that creates soft, expectation-based sentence labels. We define a new learning objective for extractive summarization which incorporates learning signals from multiple oracle summaries and prove it is equivalent to estimating the oracle expectation for each document sentence. Without any architectural modifications, the proposed labeling scheme achieves superior performance on a variety of summarization benchmarks across domains and languages, in both supervised and zero-shot settings",

    "title": "Continuous-time identification of dynamic state-space models by deep subspace encoding",
    "abstract": "Continuous-time (CT) modeling has proven to provide improved sample efficiency and interpretability in learning the dynamical behavior of physical systems compared to discrete-time (DT) models. However, even with numerous recent developments, the CT nonlinear state-space (NL-SS) model identification problem remains to be solved in full, considering common experimental aspects such as the presence of external inputs, measurement noise, latent states, and general robustness. This paper presents a novel estimation method that addresses all these aspects and that can obtain state-of-the-art results on multiple benchmarks with compact fully connected neural networks capturing the CT dynamics. The proposed estimation method called the subspace encoder approach (SUBNET) ascertains these results by efficiently approximating the complete simulation loss by evaluating short simulations on subsections of the data, by using an encoder function to estimate the initial state for each subsection and a novel state-derivative normalization to ensure stability and good numerical conditioning of the training process. We prove that the use of subsections increases cost function smoothness together with the necessary requirements for the existence of the encoder function and we show that the proposed state-derivative normalization is essential for reliable estimation of CT NL-SS models",

Rather than removing the information associated with a concept that may induce bias, our proposed method identifies two concept subspaces and makes them orthogonal. The resulting representation has these two concepts uncorrelated. Moreover, because they are orthogonal, one can simply apply a rotation on the basis of the representation so that the resulting subspace corresponds with coordinates. This explicit encoding of concepts to coordinates works because they have been made fully orthogonal, which previous approaches do not achieve. Furthermore, we show that this can be extended to multiple subspaces. As a result, one can choose a subset of concepts to be represented transparently and explicitly, while the others are retained in the mixed but extremely expressive format of the representation",

    "abstract": "Existing techniques for training language models can be misaligned with the truth: if we train models with imitation learning, they may reproduce errors that humans make; if we train them to generate text that humans rate highly, they may output errors that human evaluators can't detect. We propose circumventing this issue by directly finding latent knowledge inside the internal activations of a language model in a purely unsupervised way. Specifically, we introduce a method for accurately answering yes-no questions given only unlabeled model activations. It works by finding a direction in activation space that satisfies logical consistency properties, such as that a statement and its negation have opposite truth values. We show that despite using no supervision and no model outputs, our method can recover diverse knowledge represented in large language models: across 6 models and 10 question-answering datasets, it outperforms zero-shot accuracy by 4\\% on average. We also find that it cuts prompt sensitivity in half and continues to maintain high accuracy even when models are prompted to generate incorrect answers. Our results provide an initial step toward discovering what language models know, distinct from what they say, even when we don't have access to explicit ground truth labels",

    "title": "Diffusion Adversarial Representation Learning for Self-supervised Vessel Segmentation",
    "abstract": "Vessel segmentation in medical images is one of the important tasks in the diagnosis of vascular diseases and therapy planning. Although learning-based segmentation approaches have been extensively studied, a large amount of ground-truth labels are required in supervised methods and confusing background structures make neural networks hard to segment vessels in an unsupervised manner. To address this, here we introduce a novel diffusion adversarial representation learning (DARL) model that leverages a denoising diffusion probabilistic model with adversarial learning, and apply it to vessel segmentation. In particular, for self-supervised vessel segmentation, DARL learns the background signal using a diffusion module, which lets a generation module effectively provide vessel representations. Also, by adversarial learning based on the proposed switchable spatially-adaptive denormalization, our model estimates synthetic fake vessel images as well as vessel segmentation masks, which further makes the model capture vessel-relevant semantic information. Once the proposed model is trained, the model generates segmentation masks in a single step and can be applied to general vascular structure segmentation of coronary angiography and retinal images. Experimental results on various datasets show that our method significantly outperforms existing unsupervised and self-supervised vessel segmentation methods",

The problem has been subject of research of a large body of work, with performance frequently measured by observing scores over the wide range of environments contained in the Atari 57 benchmark. Agent57 was the first agent to surpass the human benchmark on all 57 games, but this came at the cost of poor data-efficiency, requiring nearly 80 billion frames of experience to achieve. Taking Agent57 as a starting point, we employ a diverse set of strategies to achieve a 200-fold reduction of experience needed to outperform the human baseline, within our novel agent MEME. We investigate a range of instabilities and bottlenecks we encountered while reducing the data regime, and propose effective solutions to build a more robust and efficient agent. We also demonstrate competitive performance with high-performing methods such as Muesli and MuZero. Our contributions aim to achieve faster propagation of learning signals related to rare events, stabilize learning under differing value scales, improve the neural network architecture, and make updates more robust under a rapidly-changing policy",

A substantial amount of attention has been dedicated as a consequence to the description of scaling laws, although mostly for supervised learning and only to a reduced extent for reinforcement learning frameworks. In this paper we present an extensive study of performance scaling for a cornerstone reinforcement learning algorithm, AlphaZero. On the basis of a relationship between Elo rating, playing strength and power-law scaling, we train AlphaZero agents on the games Connect Four and Pentago and analyze their performance. We find that player strength scales as a power law in neural network parameter count when not bottlenecked by available compute, and as a power of compute when training optimally sized agents. We observe nearly identical scaling exponents for both games. Combining the two observed scaling laws we obtain a power law relating optimal size to compute similar to the ones observed for language models. We find that the predicted scaling of optimal neural network size fits our data for both games. This scaling law implies that previously published state-of-the-art game-playing models are significantly smaller than their optimal size, given the respective compute budgets. We also show that large AlphaZero models are more sample efficient, performing better than smaller models with the same amount of training data",

    "title": "Perfectly Secure Steganography Using Minimum Entropy Coupling",
    "abstract": "Steganography is the practice of encoding secret information into innocuous content in such a manner that an adversarial third party would not realize that there is hidden meaning. While this problem has classically been studied in security literature, recent advances in generative models have led to a shared interest among security and machine learning researchers in developing scalable steganography techniques. In this work, we show that a steganography procedure is perfectly secure under Cachin (1998)'s information theoretic-model of steganography if and only if it is induced by a coupling. Furthermore, we show that, among perfectly secure procedures, a procedure is maximally efficient if and only if it is induced by a minimum entropy coupling. These insights yield what are, to the best of our knowledge, the first steganography algorithms to achieve perfect security guarantees with non-trivial efficiency; additionally, these algorithms are highly scalable. To provide empirical validation, we compare a minimum entropy coupling-based approach to three modern baselines---arithmetic coding, Meteor, and adaptive dynamic grouping---using GPT-2, WaveRNN, and Image Transformer as communication channels. We find that the minimum entropy coupling-based approach achieves superior encoding efficiency, despite its stronger security constraints. In aggregate, these results suggest that it may be natural to view information-theoretic steganography through the lens of minimum entropy coupling",

    "abstract": "This paper asks the intriguing question: is it possible to exploit neural architecture search (NAS) as a new attack vector to launch previously improbable attacks? Specifically, we present EVAS, a new attack that leverages NAS to find neural architectures with inherent backdoors and exploits such vulnerability using input-aware triggers. Compared with existing attacks, EVAS demonstrates many interesting properties: (i) it does not require polluting training data or perturbing model parameters; (ii) it is agnostic to downstream fine-tuning or even re-training from scratch; (iii) it naturally evades defenses that rely on inspecting model parameters or training data. With extensive evaluation on benchmark datasets, we show that EVAS features high evasiveness, transferability, and robustness, thereby expanding the adversary's design spectrum. We further characterize the mechanisms underlying EVAS, which are possibly explainable by architecture-level ``shortcuts'' that recognize trigger patterns. This work showcases that NAS can be exploited in a harmful way to find architectures with inherent backdoor vulnerability. The code is available at https://github.com/ain-soph/nas_backdoor",

Here, we leverage complexity measures including the global and local Rademacher complexities, in order to provide upper bounds on the generalization and estimation errors of model-based networks. We show that the generalization abilities of model-based networks for sparse recovery outperform those of regular ReLU networks, and derive practical design rules that allow to construct model-based networks with guaranteed high generalization. We demonstrate through a series of experiments that our theoretical insights shed light on a few behaviours experienced in practice, including the fact that ISTA and ADMM networks exhibit higher generalization abilities (especially for small number of training samples), compared to ReLU networks",

Here we propose a simple neural network building block called ChordMixer which can model the attention for long sequences with variable lengths. Each ChordMixer block consists of a position-wise rotation layer without learnable parameters and an element-wise MLP layer. Repeatedly applying such blocks forms an effective network backbone that mixes the input signals towards the learning targets.

In this case, an attack is generated from a known surrogate \\eg, the ImageNet trained model, and transferred to change the decision of an unknown (black-box) model trained on an image dataset. However, attacks generated from image models do not capture the dynamic nature of a moving object or a changing scene due to a lack of temporal cues within image models. This leads to reduced transferability of adversarial attacks from representation-enriched \\emph{image} models such as Supervised Vision Transformers (ViTs), Self-supervised ViTs (\\eg, DINO), and Vision-language models (\\eg, CLIP) to black-box \\emph{video} models. In this work, we induce dynamic cues within the image models without sacrificing their original performance on images. To this end, we optimize \\emph{temporal prompts} through frozen image models to capture motion dynamics. Our temporal prompts are the result of a learnable transformation that allows optimizing for temporal gradients during an adversarial attack to fool the motion dynamics. Specifically, we introduce spatial (image) and temporal (video) cues within the same source model through task-specific prompts. Attacking such prompts maximizes the adversarial transferability from image-to-video and image-to-image models using the attacks designed for image models. As an example, an iterative attack launched from image model Deit-B with temporal prompts reduces generalization (top1 \\% accuracy) of a video model by 35\\% on Kinetics-400. Our approach also improves adversarial transferability to image models by 9\\% on ImageNet w.r.t the current state-of-the-art approach.

    "abstract": "This paper presents MOAT, a family of neural networks that build on top of MObile convolution (i.e., inverted residual blocks) and ATtention. Unlike the current works that stack separate mobile convolution and transformer blocks, we effectively merge them into a MOAT block. Starting with a standard Transformer block, we replace its multi-layer perceptron with a mobile convolution block, and further reorder it before the self-attention operation. The mobile convolution block not only enhances the network representation capacity, but also produces better downsampled features. Our conceptually simple MOAT networks are surprisingly effective, achieving 89.1% / 81.5% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K / ImageNet-1K-V2 with ImageNet-22K pretraining. Additionally, MOAT can be seamlessly applied to downstream tasks that require large resolution inputs by simply converting the global attention to window attention. Thanks to the mobile convolution that effectively exchanges local information between pixels (and thus cross-windows), MOAT does not need the extra window-shifting mechanism. As a result, on COCO object detection, MOAT achieves 59.2% AP\nbox\n with 227M model parameters (single-scale inference, and hard NMS), and on ADE20K semantic segmentation, MOAT attains 57.6% mIoU with 496M model parameters (single-scale inference). Finally, the tiny-MOAT family, obtained by simply reducing the channel sizes, also surprisingly outperforms several mobile-specific transformer-based models on ImageNet. The tiny-MOAT family is also benchmarked on downstream tasks, serving as a baseline for the community. We hope our simple yet effective MOAT will inspire more seamless integration of convolution and self-attention. Code is publicly available",

Our theoretical proof connects PGrad to the spectral analysis of Hessian in training neural networks. Experiments on DomainBed and WILDS benchmarks demonstrate that our approach effectively enables robust DG optimization and leads to smoothly decreased loss curves.

    "abstract": "Image copy detection and retrieval from large databases leverage two components. First, a neural network maps an image to a vector representation, that is relatively robust to various transformations of the image. Second, an efficient but approximate similarity search algorithm trades scalability (size and speed) against quality of the search, thereby introducing a source of error. \nThis paper improves the robustness of image copy detection with active indexing, that optimizes the interplay of these two components.  We reduce the quantization loss of a given image representation by making imperceptible changes to the image before its release. The loss is back-propagated through the deep neural network back to the image, under perceptual constraints. These modifications make the image more retrievable. \nOur experiments show that the retrieval and copy detection of activated images is significantly improved. For instance, activation improves by \n+\n40\n%\n the Recall1@1 on various image transformations, and for several popular indexing structures based on product quantization and locality sensitivity hashing",

In pursuit of generic and adaptive solutions to this partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) based on deep reinforcement learning (RL), we design\na Deep Recurrent Q-Network (DRQN) with explicit recurrent position estimation in this dynamic grid world. Our extensive experiments show that pre-training this position estimation module before Q-learning can significantly improve the construction performance measured by the intersection-over-union score, achieving the best results in our benchmark of various baselines including model-free and model-based RL, a handcrafted SLAM-based policy, and human players.

    "abstract": "CROSS exchange (CE), a meta-heuristic that solves various vehicle routing problems (VRPs), improves the solutions of VRPs by swapping the sub-tours of the vehicles. Inspired by CE, we propose Neuro CE (NCE), a fundamental operator of \\textit{learned} meta-heuristic, to solve various min-max VRPs while overcoming the limitations of CE, i.e., the expensive \nO\n(\nn\n4\n)\n search cost. NCE employs graph neural network to predict the cost-decrements (i.e., results of CE searches) and utilizes the predicted cost-decrements to guide the selection of sub-tours for swapping, while reducing the search cost to \nO\n(\nn\n2\n)\n. As the learning objective of NCE is to predict the cost-decrement, the training can be simply done in a supervised fashion, whose training samples can be easily collected. Despite the simplicity of NCE, numerical results show that the NCE trained with min-max flexible multi-depot VRP (min-max FMDVRP) outperforms the meta-heuristic baselines. More importantly, it significantly outperforms the neural baselines when solving distinctive special cases of min-max FMDVRP (e.g., min-max MDVRP, min-max mTSP, min-max CVRP) without additional training",

We understand a scene by decomposing the scene into different concepts (e.g., shape and position of an object) and learning the respective laws of these concepts, which may be either natural (e.g., laws of motion) or man-made (e.g., laws of a game). The automatic parsing of these laws indicates the model's ability to understand the scene, which makes law parsing play a central role in many visual tasks. This paper proposes a deep latent variable model for Compositional LAw Parsing (CLAP), which achieves the human-like compositionality ability through an encoding-decoding architecture to represent concepts in the scene as latent variables. CLAP employs concept-specific latent random functions instantiated with Neural Processes to capture the law of concepts. Our experimental results demonstrate that CLAP outperforms the baseline methods in multiple visual tasks such as intuitive physics, abstract visual reasoning, and scene representation. The law manipulation experiments illustrate CLAP's interpretability by modifying specific latent random functions on samples. For example, CLAP learns the laws of position-changing and appearance constancy from the moving balls in a scene, making it possible to exchange laws between samples or compose existing laws into novel laws",

Prior works approach these problems one at a time and often require post-processing or multistage training which become less practical and do not scale very well for large datasets or architectures. Our method constructs a joint training objective that penalizes the self information of network parameters in a latent representation space to encourage small model size while also introducing priors to increase structured sparsity in the parameter space to reduce computation. When compared with existing state-of-the-art model compression methods, we achieve up to 50% smaller model size and 98% model sparsity on ResNet-20 on the CIFAR-10 dataset as well as 37% smaller model size and 71% structured sparsity on ResNet-50 trained on ImageNet while retaining the same accuracy as those methods. We show that the resulting sparsity can improve the inference time of the models by almost 1.8 times the dense ResNet-50 baseline model.

    "abstract": "The performance of deep neural networks is strongly influenced by the training dataset setup. In particular, when attributes with a strong correlation with the target attribute are present, the trained model can provide unintended prejudgments and show significant inference errors (i.e., the dataset bias problem). Various methods have been proposed to mitigate dataset bias, and their emphasis is on weakly correlated samples, called bias-conflicting samples. These methods are based on explicit bias labels provided by humans. However, such methods require human costs. Recently, several studies have sought to reduce human intervention by utilizing the output space values of neural networks, such as feature space, logits, loss, or accuracy. However, these output space values may be insufficient for the model to understand the bias attributes well. In this study, we propose a debiasing algorithm leveraging gradient called Per-sample Gradient-based Debiasing (PGD). PGD is comprised of three steps: (1) training a model on uniform batch sampling, (2) setting the importance of each sample in proportion to the norm of the sample gradient, and (3) training the model using importance-batch sampling, whose probability is obtained in step (2). Compared with existing baselines for various datasets, the proposed method showed state-of-the-art accuracy for the classification task. Furthermore, we describe theoretical understandings of how PGD can mitigate dataset bias",

We propose AudioGen, an auto-regressive generative model, operating on a learnt discrete audio representation, that generates audio samples conditioned on text inputs. The task of text-to-audio generation poses multiple challenges. Due to the way audio travels through a medium, differentiating ``objects'' can be a difficult task (e.g., separating multiple people simultaneously speaking). This is further complicated by real-world recording conditions (e.g., background noise, reverberation, etc.). Scarce text annotations impose another constraint, limiting the ability to scale models. Finally, modeling high fidelity audio requires one to operate over extremely long sequences. To alleviate the aforementioned challenges we propose an augmentation technique that mixes different audio samples, driving the model to internally learn to separate multiple sources. We curated 10 datasets containing different types of audio and text annotations to handle the scarcity of text-audio data points. For faster inference, we explore the use of multi-stream modeling, allowing the use of shorter sequences while maintaining a similar bitrate and perceptual quality. Finally, we apply classifier-free guidance to improve adherence to text. Comparing to the evaluated baselines, AudioGen outperforms over both objective and subjective metrics.

Inspired by these results, we equip Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) with plasticity rules to enable them to adapt their parameters according to ongoing experiences. In addition to the traditional local Hebbian plasticity, we propose a global, gradient-based plasticity rule, which allows the model to evolve towards its self-determined target. Our models show promising results on sequential and associative memory tasks, illustrating their ability to robustly form and retain memories. In the meantime, these models can cope with many challenging few-shot learning problems. Comparing different plasticity rules under the same framework shows that Hebbian plasticity is well-suited for several memory and associative learning tasks; however, it is outperformed by gradient-based plasticity on few-shot regression tasks which require the model to infer the underlying mapping",

    "abstract": "We study reward-free reinforcement learning with linear function approximation for episodic Markov decision processes (MDPs). In this setting, an agent first interacts with the environment without accessing the reward function in the exploration phase. In the subsequent planning phase, it is given a reward function and asked to output an \nϵ\n-optimal policy. We propose a novel algorithm LSVI-RFE under the linear MDP setting, where the transition probability and reward functions are linear in a feature mapping. We prove an \nO\n~\n(\nH\n4\nd\n2\n/\nϵ\n2\n)\n sample complexity upper bound for LSVI-RFE, where \nH\n is the episode length and \nd\n is the feature dimension. We also establish a sample complexity lower bound of \nΩ\n(\nH\n3\nd\n2\n/\nϵ\n2\n)\n. To the best of our knowledge, LSVI-RFE is the first computationally efficient algorithm that achieves the minimax optimal sample complexity in linear MDP settings up to an \nH\n and logarithmic factors. Our LSVI-RFE algorithm is based on a novel variance-aware exploration mechanism to avoid overly-conservative exploration in prior works. Our sharp bound relies on the decoupling of UCB bonuses during two phases, and a Bernstein-type self-normalized bound, which remove the extra dependency of sample complexity on \nH\n and \nd\n, respectively",

    "abstract": "Data-efficiency has always been an essential issue in pixel-based reinforcement learning (RL). As the agent not only learns decision-making but also meaningful representations from images. The line of reinforcement learning with data augmentation shows significant improvements in sample-efficiency. However, it is challenging to guarantee the optimality invariant transformation, that is, the augmented data are readily recognized as a completely different state by the agent. In the end, we propose a contrastive invariant transformation (CoIT), a simple yet promising learnable data augmentation combined with standard model-free algorithms to improve sample-efficiency. Concretely, the differentiable CoIT leverages original samples with augmented samples and hastens the state encoder for a contrastive invariant embedding. We evaluate our approach on DeepMind Control Suite and Atari100K. Empirical results verify advances using CoIT, enabling it to outperform the new state-of-the-art on various tasks.

One challenge in adapting existing RL algorithms to medical applications, however, is that the popular infinite support stochastic policies, e.g., Gaussian policy, may assign riskily high dosages and harm patients seriously. Hence, it is important to induce a policy class whose support only contains near-optimal actions, and shrink the action-searching area for effectiveness and reliability. To achieve this, we develop a novel quasi-optimal learning algorithm, which can be easily optimized in off-policy settings with guaranteed convergence under general function approximations. Theoretically, we analyze the consistency, sample complexity, adaptability, and convergence of the proposed algorithm.

This paper provides a theoretical analysis of generalization error of {federated learning}, which captures both heterogeneity and relatedness of the distributions. In particular, we assume that the heterogeneous distributions are sampled from a meta-distribution. In this two-level distribution framework, we characterize the generalization error not only for clients participating in the training but also for unparticipating clients. We first show that the generalization error for unparticipating clients can be bounded by participating generalization error and participating gap caused by clients' sampling. We further establish fast learning bounds of order \nO\n(\n1\nm\nn\n+\n1\nm\n)\n for unparticipating clients, where \nm\n is the number of clients and \nn\n is the sample size at each client.

    "abstract": "Transformers have quickly shined in the computer vision world since the emergence of Vision Transformers (ViTs). The dominant role of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) seems to be challenged by increasingly effective transformer-based models. Very recently, a couple of advanced convolutional models strike back with large kernels motivated by the local-window attention mechanism, showing appealing performance and efficiency. While one of them, i.e. RepLKNet, impressively manages to scale the kernel size to 31x31 with improved performance, the performance starts to saturate as the kernel size continues growing, compared to the scaling trend of advanced ViTs such as Swin Transformer. In this paper, we explore the possibility of training extreme convolutions larger than 31x31 and test whether the performance gap can be eliminated by strategically enlarging convolutions. This study ends up with a recipe for applying extremely large kernels from the perspective of sparsity, which can smoothly scale up kernels to 61x61 with better performance. Built on this recipe, we propose Sparse Large Kernel Network (SLaK), a pure CNN architecture equipped with sparse factorized 51x51 kernels that can perform on par with or better than state-of-the-art hierarchical Transformers and modern ConvNet architectures like ConvNeXt and RepLKNet, on ImageNet classification as well as a wide range of downstream tasks including semantic segmentation on ADE20K, object detection on PASCAL VOC 2007, and object detection/segmentation on MS COCO.

While previous works have only demonstrated that oversmoothing is inevitable when the number of graph convolutions tends to infinity, in this paper, we precisely characterize the mechanism behind the phenomenon via a non-asymptotic analysis. Specifically, we distinguish between two different effects when applying graph convolutions—an undesirable mixing effect that homogenizes node representations in different classes, and a desirable denoising effect that homogenizes node representations in the same class. By quantifying these two effects on random graphs sampled from the Contextual Stochastic Block Model (CSBM), we show that oversmoothing happens once the mixing effect starts to dominate the denoising effect, and the number of layers required for this transition is \nO\n(\nlog\n⁡\nN\n/\nlog\n⁡\n(\nlog\n⁡\nN\n)\n)\n for sufficiently dense graphs with \nN\n nodes. We also extend our analysis to study the effects of Personalized PageRank (PPR), or equivalently, the effects of initial residual connections on oversmoothing. Our results suggest that while PPR mitigates oversmoothing at deeper layers, PPR-based architectures still achieve their best performance at a shallow depth and are outperformed by the graph convolution approach on certain graphs. Finally, we support our theoretical results with numerical experiments, which further suggest that the oversmoothing phenomenon observed in practice can be magnified by the difficulty of optimizing deep GNN models",

However, higher-order relations in practice contain complex patterns and are often highly irregular. So, it is often challenging to design an HNN that suffices to express those relations while keeping computational efficiency. Inspired by hypergraph diffusion algorithms, this work proposes a new HNN architecture named ED-HNN, which provably approximates any continuous equivariant hypergraph diffusion operators that can model a wide range of higher-order relations. ED-HNN can be implemented efficiently by combining star expansions of hypergraphs with standard message passing neural networks. ED-HNN further shows great superiority in processing heterophilic hypergraphs and constructing deep models. We evaluate ED-HNN for node classification on nine real-world hypergraph datasets.

In this paper, we propose the teacher-guided training (TGT) framework for training a high-quality compact model that leverages the knowledge acquired by pretrained generative models, while obviating the need to go through a large volume of data. TGT exploits the fact that the teacher has acquired a good representation of the underlying data domain, which typically corresponds to a much lower dimensional manifold than the input space. Furthermore, we can use the teacher to explore input space more efficiently through sampling or gradient-based methods; thus, making TGT especially attractive for limited data or long-tail settings. We formally capture this benefit of proposed data-domain exploration in our generalization bounds. We find that TGT can improve accuracy on several image classification benchmarks as well as a range of text classification and retrieval tasks",

Our core contribution is to establish simple and effective prompts that improve GPT-3’s reliability as it: 1) generalizes out-of-distribution, 2) balances demographic distribution and uses natural language instructions to reduce social biases, 3) calibrates output probabilities, and 4) updates the LLM’s factual knowledge and reasoning chains. With appropriate prompts, GPT-3 is more reliable than smaller-scale supervised models on all these facets. We release all processed datasets, evaluation scripts, and model predictions. Our systematic empirical study not only sheds new insights on the reliability of prompting LLMs, but more importantly, our prompting strategies can help practitioners more reliably use LLMs like GPT-3",

    "title": "Human alignment of neural network representations",
    "abstract": "Today’s computer vision models achieve human or near-human level performance across a wide variety of vision tasks. However, their architectures, data, and learning algorithms differ in numerous ways from those that give rise to human vision. In this paper, we investigate the factors that affect the alignment between the representations learned by neural networks and human mental representations inferred from behavioral responses. We find that model scale and architecture have essentially no effect on the alignment with human behavioral responses, whereas the training dataset and objective function both have a much larger impact. These findings are consistent across three datasets of human similarity judgments collected using two different tasks. Linear transformations of neural network representations learned from behavioral responses from one dataset substantially improve alignment with human similarity judgments on the other two datasets. In addition, we find that some human concepts such as food and animals are well-represented by neural networks whereas others such as royal or sports-related objects are not. Overall, although models trained on larger, more diverse datasets achieve better alignment with humans than models trained on ImageNet alone, our results indicate that scaling alone is unlikely to be sufficient to train neural networks with conceptual representations that match those used by humans",

One natural approach is to initialize the policy for online learning with the one trained offline.\nIn this work, we introduce a policy expansion scheme for this task. After learning the offline policy, we use it as one candidate policy in a policy set, and further learn another policy that will be responsible for further learning as an expansion to the policy set. The two policies will be composed in an adaptive manner for interacting with the environment. With this approach, the policy previously learned offline is fully retained during online learning, thus mitigating the potential issues such as destroying the useful behaviors of the offline policy in the initial stage of online learning while allowing the offline policy participate in the  exploration  naturally in an adaptive manner.

    "abstract": "Designing robust loss functions is popular in learning with noisy labels while existing designs did not explicitly consider the overfitting property of deep neural networks (DNNs). As a result, applying these losses may still suffer from overfitting/memorizing noisy labels as training proceeds. In this paper, we first theoretically analyze the memorization effect and show that a lower-capacity model may perform better on noisy datasets. However, it is non-trivial to design a neural network with the best capacity given an arbitrary task. To circumvent this dilemma, instead of changing the model architecture, we decouple DNNs into an encoder followed by a linear classifier and propose to restrict the function space of a DNN by a representation regularizer. Particularly, we require the distance between two self-supervised features to be positively related to the distance between the corresponding two supervised model outputs.  \nOur proposed framework is easily extendable and can incorporate many other robust loss functions to further improve performance.

    "title": "Learning Cut Selection for Mixed-Integer Linear Programming via Hierarchical Sequence Model",
    "abstract": "Cutting planes (cuts) are important for solving mixed-integer linear programs (MILPs), which formulate a wide range of important real-world applications. Cut selection---which aims to select a proper subset of the candidate cuts to improve the efficiency of solving MILPs---heavily depends on (P1) which cuts should be preferred, and (P2) how many cuts should be selected. Although many modern MILP solvers tackle (P1)-(P2) by manually designed heuristics, machine learning offers a promising approach to learn more effective heuristics from MILPs collected from specific applications. However, many existing learning-based methods focus on learning which cuts should be preferred, neglecting the importance of learning the number of cuts that should be selected. Moreover, we observe from extensive empirical results that (P3) what order of selected cuts should be preferred has a significant impact on the efficiency of solving MILPs as well. To address this challenge, we propose a novel hierarchical sequence model (HEM) to learn cut selection policies via reinforcement learning. Specifically, HEM consists of a two-level model: (1) a higher-level model to learn the number of cuts that should be selected, (2) and a lower-level model---that formulates the cut selection task as a sequence to sequence learning problem---to learn policies selecting an ordered subset with the size determined by the higher-level model. To the best of our knowledge, HEM is the first method that can tackle (P1)-(P3) in cut selection simultaneously from a data-driven perspective. Experiments show that HEM significantly improves the efficiency of solving MILPs compared to human-designed and learning-based baselines on both synthetic and large-scale real-world MILPs, including MIPLIB 2017. Moreover, experiments demonstrate that HEM well generalizes to MILPs that are significantly larger than those seen during training",

Our model is able to adaptively infer brain spatial-temporal relations during sleep for spatial-temporal feature modeling through a well-designed Bayesian relation inference component. Meanwhile, our model also includes a spatial transformer for extracting brain spatial features and a temporal transformer for capturing temporal features. Experiments show that our BSTT outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on ISRUC and MASS datasets.

To this end, we introduce a Value Function Search that employs a population of perturbed value networks to search for a better approximation.

In this work, we propose a Temporal Coherent Test-time Optimization framework (TeCo) to utilize spatio-temporal information in test-time optimization for robust video classification. To exploit information in video with self-supervised learning, TeCo minimizes the entropy of the prediction based on the global content from video clips. Meanwhile, it also feeds local content to regularize the temporal coherence at the feature level. TeCo retains the generalization ability of various video classification models and achieves significant improvements in corruption robustness across Mini Kinetics-C and Mini SSV2-C.

Recent approaches such as Deep Kernel Shaping have made progress towards reducing our reliance on them, using insights from wide NN kernel theory to improve signal propagation in vanilla DNNs (which we define as networks without skips or normalisation). However, these approaches are incompatible with the self-attention layers present in transformers, whose kernels are intrinsically more complicated to analyse and control.  And so the question remains: \\emph{is it possible to train deep vanilla transformers?} We answer this question in the affirmative by designing several approaches that use combinations of parameter initialisations, bias matrices and location-dependent rescaling to achieve faithful signal propagation in vanilla transformers. Our methods address various intricacies specific to signal propagation in transformers, including the interaction with positional encoding and causal masking. In experiments on WikiText-103 and C4, our approaches enable deep transformers without normalisation to train at speeds matching their standard counterparts, and deep vanilla transformers to reach the same performance as standard ones after about 5 times more iterations",

    "abstract": "While 6D object pose estimation has wide applications across computer vision and robotics, it remains far from being solved due to the lack of annotations. The problem becomes even more challenging when moving to category-level 6D pose, which requires generalization to unseen instances. Current approaches are restricted by leveraging annotations from simulation or collected from humans. In this paper, we overcome this barrier by introducing a self-supervised learning approach trained directly on large-scale real-world object videos for category-level 6D pose estimation in the wild. Our framework reconstructs the canonical 3D shape of an object category and learns dense correspondences between input images and the canonical shape via surface embedding. For training, we propose novel geometrical cycle-consistency losses which construct cycles across 2D-3D spaces, across different instances and different time steps. The learned correspondence can be applied for 6D pose estimation and other downstream tasks such as keypoint transfer. Surprisingly, our method, without any human annotations or simulators, can achieve on-par or even better performance than previous supervised or semi-supervised methods on in-the-wild images.

    "title": "Non-parametric Outlier Synthesis",
    "abstract": "Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is indispensable for safely deploying machine learning models in the wild. One of the key challenges is that models lack supervision signals from unknown data, and as a result, can produce overconfident predictions on OOD data. Recent work on outlier synthesis modeled the feature space as parametric Gaussian distribution, a strong and restrictive assumption that might not hold in reality. In this paper, we propose a novel framework, non-parametric outlier synthesis (NPOS), which generates artificial OOD training data and facilitates learning a reliable decision boundary between ID and OOD data. Importantly, our proposed synthesis approach does not make any distributional assumption on the ID embeddings, thereby offering strong flexibility and generality. We show that our synthesis approach can be mathematically interpreted as a rejection sampling framework. Extensive experiments show that NPOS can achieve superior OOD detection performance, outperforming the competitive rivals by a significant margin.

In this work, we propose ProbKT, a framework based on probabilistic logical reasoning to train object detection models with arbitrary types of weak supervision.

Specifically, a sequence of discrete representations derived in a self-supervised manner are predicted from the model and passed to a vocoder for speech reconstruction, while still facing the following challenges: 1) Acoustic multimodality: the discrete units derived from speech with same content could be indeterministic due to the acoustic property (e.g., rhythm, pitch, and energy), which causes deterioration of translation accuracy; 2) high latency: current S2ST systems utilize autoregressive models which predict each unit conditioned on the sequence previously generated, failing to take full advantage of parallelism. In this work, we propose TranSpeech, a speech-to-speech translation model with bilateral perturbation. To alleviate the acoustic multimodal problem, we propose bilateral perturbation (BiP), which consists of the style normalization and information enhancement stages, to learn only the linguistic information from speech samples and generate more deterministic representations. With reduced multimodality, we step forward and become the first to establish a non-autoregressive S2ST technique, which repeatedly masks and predicts unit choices and produces high-accuracy results in just a few cycles. Experimental results on three language pairs demonstrate that BiP yields an improvement of 2.9 BLEU on average compared with a baseline textless S2ST model. Moreover, our parallel decoding shows a significant reduction of inference latency, enabling speedup up to 21.4x than autoregressive technique.

Driven by the inherent differences between video and audio, our design is asymmetric w.r.t. the two modalities' pretext tasks: Whereas the auditory stream predicts both the visual and auditory targets, the visual one predicts only the auditory targets. We observe strong results in low- and high-resource labelled data settings when fine-tuning the visual and auditory encoders resulting from a single pre-training stage, in which the encoders are jointly trained. Notably, RAVEn surpasses all self-supervised methods on visual speech recognition (VSR) on LRS3, and combining RAVEn with self-training using only 30 hours of labelled data even outperforms a recent semi-supervised method trained on 90,000 hours of non-public data. At the same time, we achieve state-of-the-art results in the LRS3 low-resource setting for auditory speech recognition (as well as for VSR).

    "abstract": "Model-based reinforcement learning is one approach to increase sample efficiency. However, the accuracy of the dynamics model and the resulting compounding error over modelled trajectories are commonly regarded as key limitations. A natural question to ask is: How much more sample efficiency can be gained by improving the learned dynamics models? Our paper empirically answers this question for the class of model-based value expansion methods in continuous control problems. Value expansion methods should benefit from increased model accuracy by enabling longer rollout horizons and better value function approximations. Our empirical study, which leverages oracle dynamics models to avoid compounding model errors, shows that (1) longer horizons increase sample efficiency, but the gain in improvement decreases with each additional expansion step, and (2) the increased model accuracy only marginally increases the sample efficiency compared to learned models with identical horizons. Therefore, longer horizons and increased model accuracy yield diminishing returns in terms of sample efficiency. These improvements in sample efficiency are particularly disappointing when compared to model-free value expansion methods. Even though they introduce no computational overhead, we find their performance to be on-par with model-based value expansion methods. Therefore, we conclude that the limitation of model-based value expansion methods is not the model accuracy of the learned models. While higher model accuracy is beneficial, our experiments show that even a perfect model will not provide an un-rivaled sample efficiency but that the bottleneck lies elsewhere",

In light of the well-learned visual features, there are works that transfer image representation to the video domain and achieve good results. However, adapting image-text pre-trained models to video-text pre-training (i.e., post-pretraining) has not demonstrated a significant advantage yet. In this paper, we tackle this challenge by raising and addressing two questions: 1) what are the factors hindering post-pretraining CLIP from improving performance on video-text tasks, and 2) how to mitigate the impact of these factors. Through a series of comparative experiments and analyses, we find that the data scale and domain gap between language sources have large impacts. By these observations, we propose an Omnisource Cross-modal Learning method equipped with a Video Proxy mechanism on the basis of CLIP, namely CLIP-ViP. Extensive results show that our approach improves the performance of CLIP on video-text retrieval by a large margin.

Recently, model-based RL algorithms have greatly improved sample-efficiency by concurrently learning an internal model of the world, and supplementing real environment interactions with imagined rollouts for policy improvement. However, learning an effective model of the world from scratch is challenging, and in stark contrast to humans that rely heavily on world understanding and visual cues for learning new skills. In this work, we investigate whether internal models learned by modern model-based RL algorithms can be leveraged to solve new, distinctly different tasks faster. We propose Model-Based Cross-Task Transfer (XTRA), a framework for sample-efficient online RL with scalable pretraining and finetuning of learned world models. By offline multi-task pretraining and online cross-task finetuning, we achieve substantial improvements over a baseline trained from scratch; we improve mean performance of model-based algorithm EfficientZero by 23%, and by as much as 71% in some instances.

Active learning with the uncertainty principle works well for deep learning, especially for large-scale image classification tasks with deep neural networks. Still, it is often overlooked how the uncertainty of predictions is estimated, despite the common findings on the difficulty of accurately estimating uncertainties of deep neural networks. In this paper, we highlight the effectiveness of snapshot ensembles for deep active learning. Compared to the previous approaches based on Monte-Carlo dropout or deep ensembles, we show that a simple acquisition strategy based on uncertainties estimated from parameter snapshots gathered from a single optimization path significantly improves the quality of the acquired samples. Based on this observation, we further propose an efficient active learning algorithm that maintains a single learning trajectory throughout the entire active learning episodes, unlike the existing algorithms training models from scratch for every active learning episode. Through the extensive empirical comparison, we demonstrate the effectiveness of snapshot ensembles for deep active learning",

    "title": "Decoupled Training for Long-Tailed Classification With Stochastic Representations",
    "abstract": "Decoupling representation learning and classifier learning has been shown to be effective in classification with long-tailed data. There are two main ingredients in constructing a decoupled learning scheme; 1) how to train the feature extractor for representation learning so that it provides generalizable representations and 2) how to re-train the classifier that constructs proper decision boundaries by handling class imbalances in long-tailed data. In this work, we first apply Stochastic Weight Averaging (SWA), an optimization technique for improving the generalization of deep neural networks, to obtain better generalizing feature extractors for long-tailed classification. We then propose a novel classifier re-training algorithm based on stochastic representation obtained from the SWA-Gaussian, a Gaussian perturbed SWA, and a self-distillation strategy that can harness the diverse stochastic representations based on uncertainty estimates to build more robust classifiers. Extensive experiments on CIFAR10/100-LT, ImageNet-LT, and iNaturalist-2018 benchmarks show that our proposed method improves upon previous methods both in terms of prediction accuracy and uncertainty estimation",

    "abstract": "Recently, great success has been made in learning visual representations from text supervision, facilitating the emergence of text-supervised semantic segmentation. However, existing works focus on pixel grouping and cross-modal semantic alignment, while ignoring the correspondence among multiple augmented views of the same image. To overcome such limitation, we propose multi-View Consistent learning (ViewCo) for text-supervised semantic segmentation. Specifically, we first propose text-to-views consistency modeling to learn correspondence for multiple views of the same input image. Additionally, we propose cross-view segmentation consistency modeling to address the ambiguity issue of text supervision by contrasting the segment features of Siamese visual encoders.  The text-to-views consistency benefits dense assignment of the visual features by encouraging different crops to align with the same text, while the cross-view segmentation consistency modeling provides additional self-supervision, overcoming the limitation of ambiguous text supervision for segmentation masks. Trained with large-scale image-text data, our model can directly segment objects of arbitrary categories in a zero-shot manner. Extensive experiments show that ViewCo outperforms state-of-the-art methods on average by up to 2.9%, 1.6%, and 2.4% mIoU on PASCAL VOC2012, PASCAL Context, and COCO, respectively",

On the other hand, state-of-the-art model-based RL methods can achieve human-level sample efficiency but often take a much longer over all training time than model-free methods. However, high sample efficiency and fast training time are both important to many real-world applications. We develop SpeedyZero, a distributed RL system built upon a state-of-the-art model-based RL method, EfficientZero, with a dedicated system design for fast distributed computation. We also develop two novel algorithmic techniques, Priority Refresh and Clipped LARS, to stabilize training with massive parallelization and large batch size. SpeedyZero maintains on-par sample efficiency compared with EfficientZero while achieving a 14.5X speedup in wall-clock time, leading to human-level performances on the Atari benchmark within 35 minutes using only 300k samples.

At the same time, there is a lack of clear understanding about both the presence and further characteristics of this capability in deep learning models. In this paper, we introduce a systematic probing framework to explore the abstraction capability of deep learning models from a transferability perspective. A set of controlled experiments are conducted based on this framework, providing strong evidence that two probed pre-trained language models (PLMs), T5 and GPT2, have the abstraction capability. We also conduct in-depth analysis, thus shedding further light: (1) the whole training phase exhibits a \"memorize-then-abstract\" two-stage process; (2) the learned abstract concepts are gathered in a few middle-layer attention heads, rather than being evenly distributed throughout the model; (3) the probed abstraction capabilities exhibit robustness against concept mutations, and are more robust to low-level/source-side mutations than high-level/target-side ones; (4) generic pre-training is critical to the emergence of abstraction capability, and PLMs exhibit better abstraction with larger model sizes and data scales",

    "abstract": "We propose a generic module named Indirection Layer (InLay), which leverages indirection and data internal relationships to effectively construct symbolic indirect representations to improve out-of-distribution generalization capabilities of various neural architectures. InLay receives data input in the form of a sequence of objects, treats it as a complete weighted graph whose vertices are the objects and edge weights are scalars representing relationships between vertices. The input is first mapped via indirection to a symbolic graph with data-independent and trainable vertices. This symbolic graph is then propagated, resulting in new vertex features whose indirection will be used for prediction steps afterward. Theoretically, we show that the distances between indirection representations are bounded by the distances between corresponding graphs, implying that unseen samples with very different surface statistics can still be close in the representation space to the seen samples if they share similar internal relationships. We demonstrate that InLay is consistently effective in improving out-of-distribution generalization throughout a comprehensive suite of experiments, including IQ problems, distorted image classification, and few-shot domain adaptation NLP classification. We also conduct ablation studies to verify different design choices of InLay",

    "abstract": "Guided diffusion is a technique for conditioning the output of a diffusion model at sampling time without retraining the network for each specific task. However, one drawback of diffusion models, whether they are guided or unguided, is their slow sampling process. \nRecent techniques can accelerate unguided sampling by applying high-order numerical methods to the sampling process when viewed as differential equations. On the contrary, we discover that the same techniques do not work for guided sampling, and little has been explored about its acceleration. This paper explores the culprit of this problem and provides a solution based on operator splitting methods, motivated by our key finding that classical high-order numerical methods are unsuitable for the conditional function. Our proposed method can re-utilize the high-order methods for guided sampling and can generate images with the same quality as a 250-step DDIM baseline using 32-58% less sampling time on ImageNet256. \nWe also demonstrate usage on a wide variety of conditional generation tasks, such as text-to-image generation, colorization, inpainting, and super-resolution",

Multivalid coverage guarantees are stronger than marginal coverage guarantees in two ways: (1) They hold even conditional on group membership---that is, the target coverage level \n1\n−\nα\n holds conditionally on membership in each of an arbitrary (potentially intersecting) group in a finite collection \nG\n of regions in the feature space. (2) They hold even conditional on the value of the threshold used to produce the prediction set on a given example. In fact multivalid coverage guarantees hold even when conditioning on group membership and threshold value simultaneously.\n\nWe give two algorithms: both take as input an arbitrary non-conformity score and an arbitrary collection of possibly intersecting groups \nG\n, and then can equip arbitrary black-box predictors with prediction sets.  Our first algorithm is a direct extension of quantile regression, needs to solve only a single convex minimization problem, and produces an estimator which has group-conditional guarantees for each group in \nG\n. Our second algorithm is iterative, and gives the full guarantees of multivalid conformal prediction: prediction sets that are valid conditionally both on group membership and non-conformity threshold.

    "abstract": "A central task in computational drug discovery is to construct models from known active molecules to find further promising molecules for subsequent screening. However, typically only very few active molecules are known. Therefore, few-shot learning methods have the potential to improve the effectiveness of this critical phase of the drug discovery process. We introduce a new method for few-shot drug discovery. Its main idea is to enrich a molecule representation by knowledge about known context or reference molecules. Our novel concept for molecule representation enrichment is to associate molecules from both the support set and the query set with a large set of reference (context) molecules through a modern Hopfield network. Intuitively, this enrichment step is analogous to a human expert who would associate a given molecule with familiar molecules whose properties are known. The enrichment step reinforces and amplifies the covariance structure of the data, while simultaneously removing spurious correlations arising from the decoration of molecules. Our approach is compared with other few-shot methods for drug discovery on the FS-Mol benchmark dataset. On FS-Mol, our approach outperforms all compared methods and therefore sets a new state-of-the art for few-shot learning in drug discovery. An ablation study shows that the enrichment step of our method is the key to improve the predictive quality. In a domain shift experiment, we further demonstrate the robustness of our method",

    "title": "Test-Time Adaptation via Self-Training with Nearest Neighbor Information",
    "abstract": "Test-time adaptation (TTA) aims to adapt a trained classifier using online unlabeled test data only, without any information related to the training procedure. Most existing TTA methods adapt the trained classifier using the classifier's prediction on the test data as pseudo-label.\nHowever, under test-time domain shift, accuracy of the pseudo labels cannot be guaranteed, and thus the TTA methods often encounter performance degradation at the adapted classifier. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel test-time adaptation method, called Test-time Adaptation via Self-Training with nearest neighbor information (TAST), which is composed of the following procedures: (1) adds trainable adaptation modules on top of the trained feature extractor; (2) newly defines a pseudo-label distribution for the test data by using the nearest neighbor information; (3) trains these modules only a few times during test time to match the nearest neighbor-based pseudo label distribution and a prototype-based class distribution for the test data; and (4) predicts the label of test data using the average predicted class distribution from these modules. The pseudo-label generation is based on the basic intuition that a test data and its nearest neighbor in the embedding space are likely to share the same label under the domain shift. By utilizing multiple randomly initialized adaptation modules, TAST extracts useful information for the classification of the test data under the domain shift, using the nearest neighbor information. TAST showed better performance than the state-of-the-art TTA methods on two standard benchmark tasks, domain generalization, namely VLCS, PACS, OfficeHome, and TerraIncognita, and image corruption, particularly CIFAR-10/100C",

However, in reinforcement learning, even for supervised sub-problems such as world model learning, early stopping is not applicable as the dataset is continually evolving. As a solution, we propose a new general method that dynamically adjusts the update to data (UTD) ratio during training based on under- and overfitting detection on a small subset of the continuously collected experience not used for training. We apply our method to DreamerV2, a state-of-the-art model-based reinforcement learning algorithm, and evaluate it on the DeepMind Control Suite and the Atari 100k benchmark. The results demonstrate that one can better balance under- and overestimation by adjusting the UTD ratio with our approach compared to the default setting in DreamerV2 and that it is competitive with an extensive hyperparameter search which is not feasible for many applications. Our method eliminates the need to set the UTD hyperparameter by hand and even leads to a higher robustness with regard to other learning-related hyperparameters further reducing the amount of necessary tuning",

In most MRL methods, molecules are treated as 1D sequential tokens or 2D topology graphs, limiting their ability to incorporate 3D information for downstream tasks and, in particular, making it almost impossible for 3D geometry prediction/generation. In this paper, we propose a universal 3D MRL framework, called Uni-Mol, that significantly enlarges the representation ability and application scope of MRL schemes. Uni-Mol contains two pretrained models with the same SE(3) Transformer architecture: a molecular model pretrained by 209M molecular conformations; a pocket model pretrained by 3M candidate protein pocket data. Besides, Uni-Mol contains several finetuning strategies to apply the pretrained models to various downstream tasks. By properly incorporating 3D information, Uni-Mol outperforms SOTA in 14/15 molecular property prediction tasks. Moreover, Uni-Mol achieves superior performance in 3D spatial tasks, including protein-ligand binding pose prediction, molecular conformation generation, etc. The code, model, and data are made publicly available at https://github.com/dptech-corp/Uni-Mol",

    "abstract": "While deep learning has achieved great success in various fields, a large amount of memory is necessary to train deep neural networks, which hinders the development of massive state-of-the-art models. The reason is the conventional learning rule, backpropagation, should temporarily store input activations of all the layers in the network. To overcome this, recent studies suggested various memory-efficient implementations of backpropagation. However, those approaches incur computational overhead due to the recomputation of activations, slowing down neural network training. In this work, we propose a new learning rule which significantly reduces memory requirements while closely matching the performance of backpropagation. The algorithm combines auxiliary activation with output activation during forward propagation, while only auxiliary activation is used during backward propagation instead of actual input activation to reduce the amount of data to be temporarily stored. We mathematically show that our learning rule can reliably train the networks whose loss landscape is convex if the auxiliary activation satisfies certain conditions. Based on this observation, we suggest candidates of auxiliary activation that satisfy those conditions. Experimental results confirm that the proposed learning rule achieves competitive performance compared to backpropagation in various models such as ResNet, Transformer, BERT, ViT, and MLP-Mixer",

Consequently, they have trivial task-specific knowledge and are limited to yielding low-quality synthetic data. To combat this issue, we propose Knowledge Mixture Data Augmentation Model (KnowDA), a Seq2Seq language model pretrained on a mixture of diverse NLP tasks under a novel framework of Knowledge Mixture Training (KoMT). The goal of KoMT is to condense diverse NLP task-specific knowledge into the single KnowDA model\n(i.e., all-in-one). The resulting KnowDA could utilize these knowledge to quickly grasp the inherent synthesis law of the target task through limited training instances. Specifically, KoMT reformulates input examples from various heterogeneous NLP tasks into a unified text-to-text format and employs denoising training objectives in different granularity to learn to reconstruct partial or complete samples. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to attempt to apply 100+ NLP multi-task training for data augmentation. Extensive experiments show that i) the synthetic data produced by KnowDA successfully improves the performance of the strong pre-trained language\nmodels (i.e., Bert, ALBert and Deberta) by a large margin on the low-resource NLP benchmark FewGLUE, CoNLL’03 and WikiAnn; ii) KnowDA successful transfer the task knowledge to NLP tasks whose types are seen and unseen in KoMT",

This semantic basis represents sample-independent meaningful perturbations that change the same semantic attribute of an image on the entire latent space. The proposed global basis, called Fréchet basis, is derived by introducing Fréchet mean to the local semantic perturbations in a latent space. Fréchet basis is discovered in two stages. First, the global semantic subspace is discovered by the Fréchet mean in the Grassmannian manifold of the local semantic subspaces. Second, Fréchet basis is found by optimizing a basis of the semantic subspace via the Fréchet mean in the Special Orthogonal Group. Experimental results demonstrate that Fréchet basis provides better semantic factorization and robustness compared to the previous methods. Moreover, we suggest the basis refinement scheme for the previous methods. The quantitative experiments show that the refined basis achieves better semantic factorization while constrained on the same semantic subspace given by the previous method",

However its applicability remains unexplored in unsupervised learning, whereby the knowledge of the task matures during training.\nWe propose a novel HYperbolic Self-Paced model (HYSP) for learning skeletonbased action representations. HYSP adopts self-supervision: it uses data augmentations to generate two views of the same sample, and it learns by matching one (named online) to the other (the target). We propose to use hyperbolic uncertainty to determine the algorithmic learning pace, under the assumption that less uncertain samples should be more strongly driving the training, with a larger weight and pace. Hyperbolic uncertainty is a by-product of the adopted hyperbolic neural networks, it matures during training and it comes with no extra cost, compared to the established Euclidean SSL framework counterparts.\nWhen tested on three established skeleton-based action recognition datasets, HYSP outperforms the state-of-the-art on PKU-MMD I, as well as on 2 out of 3 downstream tasks on NTU-60 and NTU-120. Additionally, HYSP only uses positive pairs and bypasses therefore the complex and computationally-demanding mining procedures required for the negatives in contrastive techniques.\nCode is available at https://github.com/paolomandica/HYSP",

    "abstract": "MuZero Unplugged presents a promising approach for offline policy learning from logged data. It conducts Monte-Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) with a learned model and leverages Reanalyze algorithm to learn purely from offline data. For good performance, MCTS requires accurate learned models and a large number of simulations, thus costing huge computing time. This paper investigates a few hypotheses where MuZero Unplugged may not work well under the offline RL settings, including 1) learning with limited data coverage; 2) learning from offline data of stochastic environments; 3) improperly parameterized models given the offline data; 4) with a low compute budget. We propose to use a regularized one-step look-ahead approach to tackle the above issues. Instead of planning with the expensive MCTS, we use the learned model to construct an advantage estimation based on a one-step rollout. Policy improvements are towards the direction that maximizes the estimated advantage with regularization of the dataset. We conduct extensive empirical studies with BSuite environments to verify the hypotheses and then run our algorithm on the RL Unplugged Atari benchmark. Experimental results show that our proposed approach achieves stable performance even with an inaccurate learned model. On the large-scale Atari benchmark, the proposed method outperforms MuZero Unplugged by 43%. Most significantly, it uses only 5.6% wall-clock time (i.e., 1 hour) compared to MuZero Unplugged (i.e., 17.8 hours) to achieve a 150% IQM normalized score with the same hardware and software stacks.

We chain 3D morphable modelling with deferred neural rendering by performing an implicit surface rendering of “Template Object Coordinates” (TOCS), which can be understood as an unsupervised counterpart to UV maps. This provides a detailed 2D TOCS map signal that reflects the compounded geometric effects of non-rigid shape variation, camera pose, and perspective projection. We combine 2D TOCS maps with an independent appearance code to condition a StyleGAN-based deferred neural rendering (DNR) network for foreground image (object) synthesis; we use a separate code for background synthesis and do late fusion to deliver the final result. We show competitive synthesis results on 4 datasets (FFHQ faces, AFHQ Cats, Dogs, Wild), while achieving the joint disentanglement of shape, pose, object and background texture",

    "title": "Searching Lottery Tickets in Graph Neural Networks: A Dual Perspective",
    "abstract": "Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have shown great promise in various graph learning tasks. However, the computational overheads of fitting GNNs to large-scale graphs grow rapidly, posing obstacles to GNNs from scaling up to real-world applications. To tackle this issue, Graph Lottery Ticket (GLT) hypothesis articulates that there always exists a sparse subnetwork/subgraph with admirable performance in GNNs with random initialization. Such a pair of core subgraph and sparse subnetwork (called graph lottery tickets) can be uncovered by iteratively applying a novel sparsification method. While GLT provides new insights for GNN compression, it requires a full pretraining process to obtain graph lottery tickets, which is not universal and friendly to real-world applications. Moreover, the graph sparsification in GLT utilizes sampling techniques, which may result in massive information loss and aggregation failure. In this paper, we explore the searching of graph lottery tickets from a complementary perspective -- transforming a random ticket into a graph lottery ticket, which allows us to more comprehensively explore the relationships between the original network/graph and their sparse counterpart. To achieve this, we propose regularization-based network pruning and hierarchical graph sparsification, leading to our Dual Graph Lottery Ticket (DGLT) framework for a joint sparsification of network and graph. Compared to GLT, our DGLT helps achieve a triple-win situation of graph lottery tickets with high sparsity, admirable performance, and good explainability. More importantly, we rigorously prove that our model can eliminate noise and maintain reliable information in substructures using the graph information bottleneck theory. Extensive experimental results on various graph-related tasks validate the effectiveness of our framework",

    "abstract": "Video scene graph generation (VidSGG) aims to generate a sequence of graph-structure representations for the given video. However, all existing VidSGG methods are fully-supervised, i.e., they need dense and costly manual annotations. In this paper, we propose the first weakly-supervised VidSGG task with only single-frame weak supervision: SF-VidSGG. By ``weakly-supervised\", we mean that SF-VidSGG relaxes the training supervision from two different levels: 1) It only provides single-frame annotations instead of all-frame annotations. 2) The single-frame ground-truth annotation is still a weak image SGG annotation, i.e., an unlocalized scene graph. To solve this new task, we also propose a novel Pseudo Label Assignment based method, dubbed as PLA. PLA is a two-stage method, which generates pseudo visual relation annotations for the given video at the first stage, and then trains a fully-supervised VidSGG model with these pseudo labels. Specifically, PLA consists of three modules: an object PLA module, a predicate PLA module, and a future predicate prediction (FPP) module. Firstly, in the object PLA, we localize all objects for every frame. Then, in the predicate PLA, we design two different teachers to assign pseudo predicate labels. Lastly, in the FPP module, we fusion these two predicate pseudo labels by the regularity of relation transition in videos. Extensive ablations and results on the benchmark Action Genome have demonstrated the effectiveness of our PLA",

    "abstract": "Sequence-to-Sequence (seq2seq) tasks transcribe the input sequence to a target sequence. The Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) criterion is widely used in multiple seq2seq tasks. Besides predicting the target sequence, a side product of CTC is to predict the alignment, which is the most probable input-long sequence that specifies a hard aligning relationship between the input and target units. As there are multiple potential aligning sequences (called paths) that are equally considered in CTC formulation, the choice of which path will be most probable and become the predicted alignment is always uncertain. In addition, it is usually observed that the alignment predicted by vanilla CTC will drift compared with its reference and rarely provides practical functionalities. Thus, the motivation of this work is to make the CTC alignment prediction controllable and thus equip CTC with extra functionalities. The Bayes risk CTC (BRCTC) criterion is then proposed in this work, in which a customizable Bayes risk function is adopted to enforce the desired characteristics of the predicted alignment. With the risk function, the BRCTC is a general framework to adopt some customizable preference over the paths in order to concentrate the posterior into a particular subset of the paths. In applications, we explore one particular preference which yields models with the down-sampling ability and reduced inference costs. By using BRCTC with another preference for early emissions, we obtain an improved performance-latency trade-off for online models. Experimentally, the proposed BRCTC reduces the inference cost of offline models by up to 47% without performance degradation and cuts down the overall latency of online systems to an unseen level",

Although each of the learning schemes has its own strength in terms of applicability or performance, respectively, it is difficult for any method in the either category to be considered as a gold standard since their successful performances are typically limited to specific cases. To that end, we propose a principled method, dubbed as FairDRO, which unifies the two learning schemes by incorporating a well-justified group fairness metric into the training objective using a classwise distributionally robust optimization (DRO) framework. We then develop an iterative optimization algorithm that minimizes the resulting objective by automatically producing the correct re-weights for each group. Our experiments show that FairDRO is scalable and easily adaptable to diverse applications, and consistently achieves the state-of-the-art performance on several benchmark datasets in terms of the accuracy-fairness trade-off, compared to recent strong baselines",

Inspired by setwise connectivity in biology, we extend Hopfield networks by adding setwise connections and embedding these connections in a simplicial complex. Simplicial complexes are higher dimensional analogues of graphs which naturally represent collections of pairwise and setwise relationships. We show that our simplicial Hopfield networks increase memory storage capacity. Surprisingly, even when connections are limited to a small random subset of equivalent size to an all-pairwise network, our networks still outperform their pairwise counterparts. Such scenarios include non-trivial simplicial topology.

Neural Processes (NPs), which model the distributions over functions conditioned on partial observations (context set), provide a practical solution for fast inference of continuous functions. However, existing NP architectures suffer from inferior modeling capability for complex signals. In this paper, we propose an efficient NP framework dubbed Versatile Neural Processes (VNP), which largely increases the capability of approximating functions. Specifically, we introduce a bottleneck encoder that produces fewer and informative context tokens, relieving the high computational cost while providing high modeling capability. At the decoder side, we hierarchically learn multiple global latent variables that jointly model the global structure and the uncertainty of a function, enabling our model to capture the distribution of complex signals. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed VNP on a variety of tasks involving 1D, 2D and 3D signals.

All the existing algorithms adhere to the same reward learning principle, where the adaptive return is simply formulated in the form of expected cumulative rewards, upon which the policy and critic update rules are specified under well-adopted distance metrics. In this paper, we present a novel algorithm that builds on the success of meta-gradient RL algorithms and effectively improves such algorithms by following a simple recipe, i.e., going beyond the expected return to formulate and learn the return in a more expressive form, value distributions. To this end, we first formulate a distributional return that could effectively capture bootstrapping and discounting behaviors over distributions, to form an informative distributional return target in value update. Then we derive an efficient meta update rule to learn the adaptive distributional return with meta-gradients. For empirical evaluation, we first present an illustrative example on a toy two-color grid-world domain, which validates the benefit of learning distributional return over expectation; then we conduct extensive comparisons on a large-scale RL benchmark Atari 2600, where we confirm that our proposed method with distributional return works seamlessly well with the actor-critic framework and leads to state-of-the-art median human normalized score among meta-gradient RL literature",

    "abstract": "As graph data size increases, the vast latency and memory consumption during inference pose a significant challenge to the real-world deployment of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). While quantization is a powerful approach to reducing GNNs complexity, most previous works on GNNs quantization fail to exploit the unique characteristics of GNNs, suffering from severe accuracy degradation. Through an in-depth analysis of the topology of GNNs, we observe that the topology of the graph leads to significant differences between nodes, and most of the nodes in a graph appear to have a small aggregation value. Motivated by this, in this paper, we propose the Aggregation-Aware mixed-precision Quantization (\nA\n2\nQ\n) for GNNs, where an appropriate bitwidth is automatically learned and assigned to each node in the graph. To mitigate the vanishing gradient problem caused by sparse connections between nodes, we propose a Local Gradient method to serve the quantization error of the node features as the supervision during training. We also develop a Nearest Neighbor Strategy to deal with the generalization on unseen graphs. Extensive experiments on eight public node-level and graph-level datasets demonstrate the generality and robustness of our proposed method. Compared to the FP32 models, our method can achieve up to \n18.8\n×\n (i.e., 1.70bits) compression ratio with negligible accuracy degradation. Moreover, compared to the state-of-the-art quantization method, our method can achieve up to \n11.4\n%\n and \n9.5\n%\n accuracy improvements on the node-level and graph-level tasks, respectively, and up to \n2\n×\n speedup on a dedicated hardware accelerator",

Generative replay (GR) based methods are effective for continual learning without storing history data. However, we fail when trying to intuitively adapt GR models for this setting.

In RandSAC, we group patch representations (image tokens) into hierarchically arranged segments; within each segment, tokens are predicted in parallel, similar to BERT, while across segment predictions are sequential, similar to GPT. We illustrate that randomized serialization of the segments significantly improves the performance and results in distribution over spatially-long (across-segments) and -short (within-segment) predictions which are effective for feature learning. We illustrate the pertinence of these design choices and explore alternatives on a number of datasets (e.g., CIFAR10, ImageNet).

For a model deployed in an industrial environment, fixing these mistakes quickly and robustly is vital to improve user experiences. Previous works formalize such problems as Model Editing (ME) and mostly focus on fixing one mistake. However, the one-mistake-fixing scenario is not an accurate abstraction of the real-world challenge. In the deployment of AI services, there are ever-emerging mistakes, and the same mistake may recur if not corrected in time. Thus a preferable solution is to rectify the mistakes as soon as they appear nonstop. Therefore, we extend the existing ME into the Sequential Model Editing (SME) to help develop more practical editing methods. Our study shows that current ME methods either fail to make a sequence of edits or to remember previous edits. We then introduce Transformer-Patcher, a novel model editor that can shift the behavior of transformer-based models by simply adding and training a few neurons in the last Feed-Forward Network layer. Experimental results on both classification and generation tasks show that Transformer-Patcher can successively correct up to thousands of errors (Reliability) and generalize to their equivalent inputs (Generality) while retaining the model’s accuracy on irrelevant inputs (Locality).

To boost the sample efficiency of MORL, we propose \nQ\n-Pensieve, a policy improvement scheme that stores a collection of \nQ\n-snapshots to jointly determine the policy update direction and thereby enables data sharing at the policy level. We show that \nQ\n-Pensieve can be naturally integrated with soft policy iteration with convergence guarantee. To substantiate this concept, we propose the technique of \nQ\n replay buffer, which stores the learned \nQ\n-networks from the past iterations, and arrive at a practical actor-critic implementation. Through extensive experiments and an ablation study, we demonstrate that with much fewer samples, the proposed algorithm can outperform the benchmark MORL methods on a variety of MORL benchmark tasks",

    "abstract": "Understanding the interaction between multiple agents is crucial for realistic vehicle trajectory prediction. \nExisting methods have attempted to infer the interaction from the observed past trajectories of agents using pooling, attention, or graph-based methods, which rely on a deterministic approach. \nHowever, these methods can fail under complex road structures, as they cannot predict various interactions that may occur in the future. \nIn this paper, we propose a novel approach that uses lane information to predict a stochastic future relationship among agents. \nTo obtain a coarse future motion of agents, our method first predicts the probability of lane-level waypoint occupancy of vehicles. \nWe then utilize the temporal probability of passing adjacent lanes for each agent pair, assuming that agents passing adjacent lanes will highly interact. \nWe also model the interaction using a probabilistic distribution, which allows for multiple possible future interactions. \nThe distribution is learned from the posterior distribution of interaction obtained from ground truth future trajectories. \nWe validate our method on popular trajectory prediction datasets: nuScenes and Argoverse. \nThe results show that the proposed method brings remarkable performance gain in prediction accuracy, and achieves state-of-the-art performance in long-term prediction benchmark dataset",

    "abstract": "It’s a meaningful and attractive topic to build a general and inclusive segmentation model that can recognize more categories in various scenarios. A straightforward way is to combine the existing fragmented segmentation datasets and train a multi-dataset network. However, there are two major issues with multi-dataset segmentation: (i) the inconsistent taxonomy demands manual reconciliation to construct a unified taxonomy; (ii) the inflexible one-hot common taxonomy causes time-consuming model retraining and defective supervision of unlabeled categories. In this paper, we investigate the multi-dataset segmentation and propose a scalable Language-guided Multi-dataset Segmentation framework, dubbed LMSeg, which supports both semantic and panoptic segmentation. Specifically, we introduce a pretrained text encoder to map the category names to a text embedding space as a unified taxonomy, instead of using inflexible one-hot label. The model dynamically aligns the segment queries with the category embeddings. Instead of relabeling each dataset with the unified taxonomy, a category-guided decoding module is designed to dynamically guide predictions to each dataset’s taxonomy. Furthermore, we adopt a dataset-aware augmentation strategy that assigns each dataset a specific image augmentation pipeline, which can suit the proper-\nties of images from different datasets. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves significant improvements on four segmentation datasets and three panoptic datasets, while the ablation study evaluates the effectiveness of each component",

From this probabilistic perspective, we calibrate its prediction based on the densities of labeled and unlabeled data, which leads to a simple closed-form solution from the Bayes' rule.

    "abstract": "Standard inference and training with transformer based architectures scale quadratically with input sequence length. This is prohibitively large for a variety of applications especially in web-page translation, query-answering etc. Consequently, several approaches have been developed recently to speedup attention computation by enforcing different attention structures such as sparsity, low-rank, approximating attention using kernels. In this work, we view attention computation as that of nearest neighbor retrieval, and use decision tree based hierarchical navigation to reduce the retrieval cost per query token from linear in sequence length to nearly logarithmic. Based on such hierarchical navigation, we design Treeformer which can use one of two efficient attention layers -- TF-Attention and TC-Attention. TF-Attention computes the attention in a fine-grained style, while TC-Attention is a coarse attention layer which also ensures that the gradients are \"dense\". To optimize such challenging discrete layers, we propose a two-level bootstrapped training method. Using extensive experiments on standard NLP benchmarks, especially for long-sequences, we demonstrate that our Treeformer architecture can be almost as accurate as baseline Transformer while using 30x lesser FLOPs in the attention layer. Compared to Linformer, the accuracy can be as much as 12% higher while using similar FLOPs in the attention layer",

In this work, we propose the adoption of latent variable policies within the MaxEnt framework, which we can provably approximate any policy distribution, and additionally, naturally emerges under the use of world models with a latent belief state. \nWe discuss why latent variable policies are difficult to train, how naive approaches can fail, and subsequently introduce a series of improvements centered around low-cost marginalization of the latent state, allowing us to make full use of the latent state at minimal additional cost. We instantiate our method under the actor-critic framework, marginalizing both the actor and critic. The resulting algorithm, referred to as Stochastic Marginal Actor-Critic (SMAC), is simple yet effective. We experimentally validate our method on continuous control tasks, showing that effective marginalization can lead to better exploration and more robust training.

Given the feature set, how to fully utilize the information from the feature set is an active topic in deep CTR model designs. There are several existing deep CTR works focusing on feature interactions, feature attentions, and so on. They attempt to capture high-order feature interactions to enhance the generalization ability of deep CTR models. However, these works either suffer from poor high-order feature interaction modeling using DNN or ignore the balance between generalization and memorization during the recommendation. To mitigate these problems, we propose an adaptive feature fusion framework called MaskFusion, to additionally capture the explicit interactions between the input feature and the existing deep part structure of deep CTR models dynamically, besides the common feature interactions proposed in existing works.  MaskFusion is an instance-aware feature augmentation method, which makes deep CTR models more personalized by assigning each feature with an instance-adaptive mask and fusing each feature with each hidden state vector in the deep part structure. MaskFusion can also be integrated into any existing deep CTR models flexibly. MaskFusion achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on all seven benchmarks deep CTR models with three public datasets",

However, its effects on 3D human body pose and shape estimation (3DHPSE) are open to question, whose target is fixed to a unique class, the human, and has an inherent task gap with SSL. We empirically study and analyze the effects of SSL and further compare it with other pre-training alternatives for 3DHPSE. The alternatives are 2D annotation-based pre-training and synthetic data pre-training, which share the motivation of SSL that aims to reduce the labeling cost. They have been widely utilized as a source of weak-supervision or fine-tuning, but have not been remarked as a pre-training source. SSL methods underperform the conventional ImageNet classification pre-training on multiple 3DHPSE benchmarks by 7.7% on average. In contrast, despite a much less amount of pre-training data, the 2D annotation-based pre-training improves accuracy on all benchmarks and shows faster convergence during fine-tuning. Our observations challenge the naive application of the current SSL pre-training to 3DHPSE and relight the value of other data types in the pre-training aspect",

    "abstract": "The state space in Multiagent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) grows exponentially with the agent number. Such a curse of dimensionality results in poor scalability and low sample efficiency, inhibiting MARL for decades. To break this curse, we propose a unified agent permutation framework that exploits the permutation invariance (PI) and permutation equivariance (PE) inductive biases to reduce the multiagent state space. Our insight is that permuting the order of entities in the factored multiagent state space does not change the information. Specifically, we propose two novel implementations: a Dynamic Permutation Network (DPN) and a Hyper Policy Network (HPN). The core idea is to build separate entity-wise PI input and PE output network modules to connect the entity-factored state space and action space in an end-to-end way. DPN achieves such connections by two separate module selection networks, which consistently assign the same input module to the same input entity (guarantee PI) and assign the same output module to the same entity-related output (guarantee PE). To enhance the representation capability, HPN replaces the module selection networks of DPN with hypernetworks to directly generate the corresponding module weights. Extensive experiments in SMAC, Google Research Football and MPE validate that the proposed methods significantly boost the performance and the learning efficiency of existing MARL algorithms. Remarkably, in SMAC, we achieve 100% win rates in almost all hard and super-hard scenarios (never achieved before)",

It is an efficient and useful post-hoc method for studying the interpretability of machine learning models without the need of expensive model re-training. Recently, graph convolution networks (GCNs), which operate on graph data, have attracted a great deal of attention. However, there is no preceding research on the influence functions of GCNs to shed light on the effects of removing training nodes/edges from an input graph. Since the nodes/edges in a graph are interdependent in GCNs, it is challenging to derive influence functions for GCNs. To fill this gap, we started with the simple graph convolution (SGC) model that operates on an attributed graph, and formulated an influence function to approximate the changes of model parameters when a node or an edge is removed from an attributed graph. Moreover, we theoretically analyzed the error bound of the estimated influence of removing an edge. We experimentally validated the accuracy and effectiveness of our influence estimation function. In addition, we showed that the influence function of a SGC model could be used to estimate the impact of removing training nodes/edges on the test performance of the SGC without re-training the model.

    "abstract": "Sliced Wasserstein (SW) distance has been widely used in different application scenarios since it can be scaled to a large number of supports without suffering from the curse of dimensionality. The value of sliced Wasserstein distance is the average of transportation cost between one-dimensional representations (projections) of original measures that are obtained by Radon Transform (RT). Despite its efficiency in the number of supports, estimating the sliced Wasserstein requires a relatively large number of projections in high-dimensional settings. Therefore, for applications where the number of supports is relatively small compared with the dimension, e.g., several deep learning applications where the mini-batch approaches are utilized, the complexities from matrix multiplication of Radon Transform become the main computational bottleneck. To address this issue, we propose to derive projections by linearly and randomly combining a smaller number of projections which are named bottleneck projections. We explain the usage of these projections by introducing Hierarchical Radon Transform (HRT) which is constructed by applying  Radon Transform variants recursively. We then formulate the approach into a new metric between measures, named Hierarchical Sliced Wasserstein (HSW) distance. By proving the injectivity of HRT, we derive the metricity of HSW. Moreover, we investigate the theoretical properties of HSW including its connection to SW variants and its computational and sample complexities. Finally, we compare the computational cost and generative quality of HSW with the conventional SW on the task of deep generative modeling using various benchmark datasets including CIFAR10, CelebA, and Tiny ImageNet",

    "abstract": "We aim to train accurate denoising networks for smartphone/digital cameras from single noisy images. Downscaling is commonly used as a practical denoiser for low-resolution images. Based on this processing, we found that the pixel variance of the natural images is more robust to downscaling than the pixel variance of the camera noises. Intuitively, downscaling easily removes high-frequency noises than natural textures. To utilize this property, we can adopt noisy/clean image synthesis at low-resolution to train camera denoisers. On this basis, we propose a new solution pipeline -- NERDS that estimates camera noises and synthesizes noisy-clean image pairs from only noisy images.  In particular, it first models the noise in raw-sensor images as a Poisson-Gaussian distribution, then estimates the noise parameters using the difference of pixel variances by downscaling. We formulate the noise estimation as a gradient-descent-based optimization problem through a reparametrization trick. We further introduce a new Image Signal Processor (ISP) estimation method that enables denoiser training in a human-readable RGB space by transforming the synthetic raw images to the style of a given RGB noisy image. The noise and ISP estimations utilize rich augmentation to synthesize image pairs for denoiser training. Experiments show that our NERDS can accurately train CNN-based denoisers (e.g., DnCNN, ResNet-style network) outperforming previous noise-synthesis-based and self-supervision-based denoisers in real datasets",

Importantly, there exist hierarchical relations among different levels. In this work, we propose to develop a novel hierarchical graph network, known as ProNet, to capture the relations.

By treating each amino acid as a node in graph modeling as well as harnessing the inherent hierarchies, our ProNet is more effective and efficient than existing methods. We also show that, given a base 3D graph network that is complete, our ProNet representations are also complete at all levels. Experimental results show that ProNet outperforms recent methods on most datasets. In addition, results indicate that different downstream tasks may require representations at different levels.

GAN-inversion, using a pre-trained generator as a deep generative prior, is a promising tool for image restoration under corruptions. However, the performance of GAN-inversion can be limited by a lack of robustness to unknown gross corruptions, i.e., the restored image might easily deviate from the ground truth. In this paper, we propose a Robust GAN-inversion (RGI) method with a provable robustness guarantee to achieve image restoration under unknown \\textit{gross} corruptions, where a small fraction of pixels are completely corrupted. Under mild assumptions, we show that the restored image and the identified corrupted region mask converge asymptotically to the ground truth. Moreover, we extend RGI to Relaxed-RGI (R-RGI) for generator fine-tuning to mitigate the gap between the GAN learned manifold and the true image manifold while avoiding trivial overfitting to the corrupted input image, which further improves the image restoration and corrupted region mask identification performance. The proposed RGI/R-RGI method unifies two important applications with state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance: (i) mask-free semantic inpainting, where the corruptions are unknown missing regions, the restored background can be used to restore the missing content. (ii) unsupervised pixel-wise anomaly detection, where the corruptions are unknown anomalous regions, the retrieved mask can be used as the anomalous region’s segmentation mask",

State-of-the-art coreset selection methods pick the highest importance examples based on an importance metric and are found to perform well at low pruning rates.  However, at high pruning rates, they suffer from a catastrophic accuracy drop, performing worse than even random sampling. This paper explores the reasons behind this accuracy drop both theoretically and empirically. We first propose a novel metric to measure the coverage of a dataset on a specific distribution by extending the classical geometric set cover problem to a distribution cover problem. This metric helps explain why coresets selected by SOTA methods at high pruning rates perform poorly compared to random sampling because of worse data coverage. We then propose a novel one-shot coreset selection method, Coverage-centric Coreset Selection (CCS), that jointly considers overall data coverage upon a distribution as well as the importance of each example. We evaluate CCS on five datasets and show that, at high pruning rates (e.g., 90%), it achieves significantly better accuracy than previous SOTA methods (e.g., at least 19.56% higher on CIFAR10) as well as random selection (e.g., 7.04% higher on CIFAR10) and comparable accuracy at low pruning rates.

Meanwhile, it has been shown that simple image transformations can also enhance attack transferability. Based on these two observations, we propose ILA-DA, which employs three novel augmentation techniques to enhance ILA. Specifically, we propose (1) an automated way to apply effective image transformations, (2) an efficient reverse adversarial update technique, and (3) an attack interpolation method to create more transferable adversarial examples. Shown by extensive experiments, ILA-DA greatly outperforms ILA and other state-of-the-art attacks by a large margin. On ImageNet, we attain an average attack success rate of 84.5%, which is 19.5% better than ILA and 4.7% better than the previous state-of-the-art across nine undefended models. For defended models, ILA-DA also leads existing attacks and provides further gains when incorporated into more advanced attack methods",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we study a novel inference paradigm, termed as schema inference, that learns to deductively infer the explainable predictions by rebuilding the prior deep neural network (DNN) forwarding scheme, guided by the prevalent philosophical cognitive concept of schema. We strive to reformulate the conventional model inference pipeline into a graph matching policy that associates the extracted visual concepts of an image with the pre-computed scene impression, by analogy with human reasoning mechanism via impression matching. To this end, we devise an elaborated architecture, termed as SchemaNet, as a dedicated instantiation of the proposed schema inference concept, that models both the visual semantics of input instances and the learned abstract imaginations of target categories as topological relational graphs. Meanwhile, to capture and leverage the compositional contributions of visual semantics in a global view, we also introduce a universal Feat2Graph scheme in SchemaNet to establish the relational graphs that contain abundant interaction information. Both the theoretical analysis and the experimental results on several benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed schema inference achieves encouraging performance and meanwhile yields a clear picture of the deductive process leading to the predictions.

    "abstract": "Contrastive learning, especially self-supervised contrastive learning (SSCL), has achieved great success in extracting powerful features from unlabeled data. In this work, we contribute to the theoretical understanding of SSCL and uncover its connection to the classic data visualization method, stochastic neighbor embedding (SNE), whose goal is to preserve pairwise distances. From the perspective of preserving neighboring information, SSCL can be viewed as a special case of SNE with the input space pairwise similarities specified by data augmentation. The established correspondence facilitates deeper theoretical understanding of learned features of SSCL, as well as methodological guidelines for practical improvement. Specifically, through the lens of SNE, we provide novel analysis on domain-agnostic augmentations, implicit bias and robustness of learned features. To illustrate the practical advantage, we demonstrate that the modifications from SNE to \nt\n-SNE can also be adopted in the SSCL setting, achieving significant improvement in both in-distribution and out-of-distribution generalization",

    "title": "Harnessing Mixed Offline Reinforcement Learning Datasets via Trajectory Weighting",
    "abstract": "Most offline reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms return a target policy maximizing a trade-off between (1) the expected performance gain over the behavior policy that collected the dataset, and (2) the risk stemming from the out-of-distribution-ness of the induced state-action occupancy. It follows that the performance of the target policy is strongly related to the performance of the behavior policy and, thus, the trajectory return distribution of the dataset. We show that in mixed datasets consisting of mostly low-return trajectories and minor high-return trajectories, state-of-the-art offline RL algorithms are overly restrained by low-return trajectories and fail to exploit high-performing trajectories to the fullest. To overcome this issue, we show that, in deterministic MDPs with stochastic initial states, the dataset sampling can be re-weighted to induce an artificial dataset whose behavior policy has a higher return. This re-weighted sampling strategy may be combined with any offline RL algorithm. We further analyze that the opportunity for performance improvement over the behavior policy correlates with the positive-sided variance of the returns of the trajectories in the dataset. We empirically show that while CQL, IQL, and TD3+BC achieve only a part of this potential policy improvement, these same algorithms combined with our reweighted sampling strategy fully exploit the dataset. Furthermore, we empirically demonstrate that, despite its theoretical limitation, the approach may still be efficient in stochastic environments",

In this paper, we propose a new decoding strategy, self-consistency, to replace the naive greedy decoding used in chain-of-thought prompting. It first samples a diverse set of reasoning paths instead of only taking the greedy one, and then selects the most consistent answer by marginalizing out all possible reasoning paths. Self-consistency leverages the intuition that a complex reasoning problem typically admits multiple different ways of thinking leading to its unique correct answer.  Our extensive empirical evaluation shows that self-consistency boosts the performance of chain-of-thought prompting with a striking margin on a range of popular arithmetic and commonsense reasoning benchmarks, including GSM8K (+17.9%), SVAMP (+11.0%), AQuA (+12.2%), StrategyQA (+6.4%) and ARC-challenge (+3.9%)",

    "abstract": "A recourse action aims to explain a particular algorithmic decision by showing one specific way in which the instance could be modified to receive an alternate outcome. Existing recourse generation methods often assume that the machine learning model does not change over time. However, this assumption does not always hold in practice because of data distribution shifts, and in this case, the recourse action may become invalid. To redress this shortcoming, we propose the Distributionally Robust Recourse Action (DiRRAc) framework, which generates a recourse action that has high probability of being valid under a mixture of model shifts. We first formulate the robustified recourse setup as a min-max optimization problem, where the max problem is specified by Gelbrich distance over an ambiguity set around the distribution of model parameters. Then we suggest a projected gradient descent algorithm to find a robust recourse according to the min-max objective. We also show that our DiRRAc framework can be extended to hedge against the misspecification of the mixture weights. Numerical experiments with both synthetic and three real-world datasets demonstrate the benefits of our proposed framework over the state-of-the-art recourse methods, which generate robust recourses",

    "abstract": "Recent advances in vision-language pre-training have pushed the state-of-the-art on various vision-language tasks, making machines more capable of multi-modal writing (image-to-text generation) and painting (text-to-image generation). However, few studies investigate if these two essential capabilities can be learned together and boost each other, making a versatile and powerful multi-modal foundation model. In this work, we disclose the potential of symmetric generative vision-language pre-training in learning to write and paint concurrently, and propose a new unified modal model, named DaVinci, trained with prefix language modeling and prefix image modeling, a simple generative self-supervised objective on image-text pairs. Thanks to the proposed prefix multi-modal modeling framework, DaVinci is simple to train, scalable to huge data, adaptable to both writing and painting tasks, and also strong on other vision, text, and multi-modal understanding tasks. DaVinci achieves competitive performance on a wide range of 27 generation/understanding tasks and demonstrates the superiority of combining vision/language generative pre-training. Furthermore, we carefully benchmark the performance of different vision-language pre-training objectives on different scales of pre-training datasets on a heterogeneous and broad distribution coverage. Our results demonstrate the potential of exploiting self-supervision in both language and vision inputs, and establish new, stronger baselines for future comparisons at different data scales.

    "abstract": "Many recent works on understanding deep learning try to quantify how much individual data instances influence the optimization and generalization of a model. Such attempts reveal characteristics and importance of individual instances, which may provide useful information in diagnosing and improving deep learning. However, most of the existing works on data valuation require actual training of a model, which often demands high-computational cost. In this paper, we provide a training-free data valuation score, called complexity-gap score, which is a data-centric score to quantify the influence of individual instances in generalization of two-layer overparameterized neural networks. The proposed score can quantify irregularity of the instances and measure how much each data instance contributes in the total movement of the network parameters during training. We theoretically analyze and empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of the complexity-gap score in finding `irregular or mislabeled' data instances, and also provide applications of the score in analyzing datasets and diagnosing training dynamics.

    "abstract": "Despite the recent advancement in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), the MARL agents easily overfit the training environment and perform poorly in evaluation scenarios where other agents behave differently. Obtaining generalizable policies for MARL agents is thus necessary but challenging mainly due to complex multi-agent interactions. In this work, we model the MARL problem with Markov Games and propose a simple yet effective method, called ranked policy memory (RPM), i.e., to maintain a look-up memory of policies to achieve good generalizability. The main idea of RPM is to train MARL policies via gathering massive multi-agent interaction data. In particular, we first rank each agent’s policies by its training episode return, i.e., the episode return of each agent in the training environment; we then save the ranked policies in the memory; when an episode starts, each agent can randomly select a policy from the RPM as the behavior policy. Each agent uses the behavior policy to gather multi-agent interaction data for MARL training. This innovative self-play framework guarantees the diversity of multi-agent interaction in the training data. Experimental results on Melting Pot demonstrate that RPM enables MARL agents to interact with unseen agents in multi-agent generalization evaluation scenarios and complete given tasks. It significantly boosts the performance up to 818% on average",

    "abstract": "Pretrained language models have shown superior performance on many natural language processing tasks, yet they still struggle at multi-step formal reasoning tasks like grade school math problems. One key challenge of finetuning them to solve such math reasoning problems is that many existing datasets only contain one reference solution for each problem, despite the fact that there are often alternative solutions resembling different reasoning paths to the final answer. This way, the finetuned models are biased towards the limited reference solutions, which limits their generalization to unseen examples. To mitigate this issue, we propose to let the model perform sampling during training and learn from both self-sampled fully-correct solutions, which yield the correct answer upon execution, and partially-correct solutions, whose intermediate state matches an intermediate state of a known correct solution. We show that our use of self-sampled correct and partially-correct solutions can benefit learning and help guide the sampling process, leading to more efficient exploration of the solution space. Additionally, we explore various training objectives to support learning from multiple solutions per example and find they greatly affect the performance. Experiments on two math reasoning datasets show the effectiveness of our method compared to learning from a single reference solution with MLE, where we improve PASS@100 from 35.5% to 44.5% for GSM8K, and 27.6% to 36.2% PASS@80 for MathQA.

However, a closed set may involve a highly imbalanced class distribution. Accurately differentiating open set samples and those from a minority class in the closed set poses a fundamental challenge as the model may be equally uncertain when recognizing samples from the minority class. In this paper, we propose Adaptive Robust Evidential Optimization (AREO) that offers a principled way to quantify sample uncertainty through evidential learning while optimally balancing the model training over all classes in the closed set through adaptive distributively robust optimization (DRO). To avoid the model to primarily focus on the most difficult samples by following the standard DRO, adaptive DRO training is performed, which is governed by a novel multi-scheduler learning mechanism to ensure an optimal model training behavior that gives sufficient attention to the difficult samples and the minority class while capable of learning common patterns from the majority classes. Our experimental results on multiple real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed model outputs uncertainty scores that can clearly separate samples from closed and open sets, respectively, and the detection results outperform the competitive baselines",

The training process requires concurrent access to both datasets, which hinders data separation and privacy protection; and existing models cannot be easily adapted for translation of new domain pairs. We present Dual Diffusion Implicit Bridges (DDIBs), an image translation method based on diffusion models, that circumvents training on domain pairs. Image translation with DDIBs relies on two diffusion models trained independently on each domain, and is a two-step process: DDIBs first obtain latent encodings for source images with the source diffusion model, and then decode such encodings using the target model to construct target images. Both steps are defined via ordinary differential equations (ODEs), thus the process is cycle consistent only up to discretization errors of the ODE solvers. Theoretically, we interpret DDIBs as concatenation of source to latent, and latent to target Schrodinger Bridges, a form of entropy-regularized optimal transport, to explain the efficacy of the method. Experimentally, we apply DDIBs on synthetic and high-resolution image datasets, to demonstrate their utility in a wide variety of translation tasks and their inherent optimal transport properties",

In practice, the training data used to construct a decision tree may change over time or contain noise, and a drastic change in the learned tree structure owing to such data perturbation is unfavorable. For example, in data mining, a change in the tree implies a change in the extracted knowledge, which raises the question of whether the extracted knowledge is truly reliable or is only a noisy artifact. To alleviate this issue, we design decision tree learning algorithms that are stable against insignificant perturbations in the training data. Specifically, we adopt the notion of average sensitivity as a stability measure, and design an algorithm with low average sensitivity that outputs a decision tree whose accuracy is close to the optimal decision tree. The experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed algorithm enables users to select suitable decision trees considering the trade-off between average sensitivity and accuracy",

Despite already providing impressive empirical results, these diffusion models algorithms can be further improved by reducing the variance of the training targets in their denoising score-matching objective. We argue that the source of such variance lies in the handling of intermediate noise-variance scales, where multiple modes in the data affect the direction of reverse paths. We propose to remedy the problem by incorporating a reference batch which we use to calculate weighted conditional scores as more stable training targets. We show that the procedure indeed helps in the challenging intermediate regime by reducing (the trace of) the covariance of training targets. The new stable targets can be seen as trading bias for reduced variance, where the bias vanishes with increasing reference batch size. Empirically, we show that the new objective improves the image quality, stability, and training speed of various popular diffusion models across datasets with both general ODE and SDE solvers.

However, existing methods for graph unlearning either deteriorate model weights shared across all nodes or fail to effectively delete edges due to their strong dependence on local graph neighborhoods. To address these limitations, we introduce GNNDelete, a novel model-agnostic layer-wise operator that optimizes two critical properties, namely, Deleted Edge Consistency and Neighborhood Influence, for graph unlearning. Deleted Edge Consistency ensures that the influence of deleted elements is removed from both model weights and neighboring representations, while Neighborhood Influence guarantees that the remaining model knowledge is preserved after deletion. GNNDelete updates representations to delete nodes and edges from the model while retaining the rest of the learned knowledge. We conduct experiments on seven real-world graphs, showing that GNNDelete outperforms existing approaches by up to 38.8% (AUC) on edge, node, and node feature deletion tasks, and 32.2% on distinguishing deleted edges from non-deleted ones. Additionally, GNNDelete is efficient, taking 12.3x less time and 9.3x less space than retraining GNN from scratch on WordNet18",

Numerical experiments on several tabular data sets showthe benefits of this new, simple and easy-to-use method, both in terms of generalization capacity and computation time, compared to default MLP initialization and even to existing complex deep learning solutions. In fact, this wise MLP initialization raises the performances of the resulting NN methods to that of gradient boosting on tabular data. Besides, such initializations are able to preserve the sparsity of weights introduced in the first layers of the network throughout the training, which emphasizes that the first layers act as a sparse feature extractor (like convolutional layers in CNN)",

Moreover, larger Transformers with more layers and wider MLP hidden dimensions are sparser as measured by the percentage of nonzero entries. Through extensive experiments we demonstrate that the emergence of sparsity is a prevalent phenomenon that occurs for both natural language processing and vision tasks, on both training and evaluation data, for Transformers of various configurations, at layers of all depth levels. We discuss how sparsity immediately implies a way to significantly reduce the FLOP count and improve efficiency for Transformers.

While this allows GNNs to learn features depending on the graph structure, for certain graph topologies it leads to inefficient information propagation and a problem known as oversquashing. This has recently been linked with the curvature and spectral gap of the graph. On the other hand, adding edges to the message-passing graph can lead to increasingly similar node representations and a problem known as oversmoothing. We propose a computationally efficient algorithm that prevents oversquashing by systematically adding edges to the graph based on spectral expansion. We combine this with a relational architecture, which lets the GNN preserve the original graph structure and provably prevents oversmoothing. We find experimentally that our algorithm outperforms existing graph rewiring methods in several graph classification tasks",

    "title": "Generative Modeling Helps Weak Supervision (and Vice Versa)",
    "abstract": "Many promising applications of supervised machine learning face hurdles in the acquisition of labeled data in sufficient quantity and quality, creating an expensive bottleneck. To overcome such limitations, techniques that do not depend on ground truth labels have been studied, including weak supervision and generative modeling. While these techniques would seem to be usable in concert, improving one another, how to build an interface between them is not well-understood. In this work, we propose a model fusing programmatic weak supervision and generative adversarial networks and provide theoretical justification motivating this fusion. The proposed approach captures discrete latent variables in the data alongside the weak supervision derived label estimate. Alignment of the two allows for better modeling of sample-dependent accuracies of the weak supervision sources, improving the estimate of unobserved labels. It is the first approach to enable data augmentation through weakly supervised synthetic images and pseudolabels. Additionally, its learned latent variables can be inspected qualitatively. The model outperforms baseline weak supervision label models on a number of multiclass image classification datasets, improves the quality of generated images, and further improves end-model performance through data augmentation with synthetic samples",

Instead of developing masked language modeling (MLM) and masked image modeling (MIM) independently, we propose to build joint masked vision and language modeling, where the masked signal of one modality is reconstructed with the help from another modality. This is motivated by the nature of image-text paired data that both of the image and the text convey almost the same information but in different formats. The masked signal reconstruction of one modality conditioned on another modality can also implicitly learn cross-modal alignment between language tokens and image patches. Our experiments on various V+L tasks show that the proposed method, along with common V+L alignment losses, not only achieves state-of-the-art performance by using a large amount of data but also outperforms the other competitors by a significant margin in the regimes of limited training data",

To mitigate these issues, we adapt the scheduled sampling algorithm to diffusion training.

While most databases and machine-learning-based generation models aim to optimize particular chemical properties, there is limited literature on how to properly measure the coverage of the chemical space by those candidates included or generated. This problem is challenging due to the lack of formal criteria to select good measures of the chemical space. In this paper, we propose a novel evaluation framework for measures of the chemical space based on two analyses: an axiomatic analysis with three intuitive axioms that a good measure should obey, and an empirical analysis on the correlation between a measure and a proxy gold standard. Using this framework, we are able to identify #Circles, a new measure of chemical space coverage, which is superior to existing measures both analytically and empirically. We further evaluate how well the existing databases and generation models cover the chemical space in terms of #Circles. The results suggest that many generation models fail to explore a larger space over existing databases, which leads to new opportunities for improving generation models by encouraging exploration",

This has been empirically observed in beam search decoding as output quality degrading with large beam sizes,  and decoding strategies benefiting from heuristics such as length normalization and repetition-blocking. In this work, we introduce sequence likelihood calibration (SLiC) where the likelihood of model generated sequences are calibrated to better align with reference sequences in the model’s latent space.  With SLiC, decoding heuristics become unnecessary and decoding candidates’ quality significantly improves regardless of the decoding method. Furthermore, SLiC shows no sign of diminishing returns with model scale, and presents alternative ways to improve quality with limited training and inference budgets.

However, the latent relationships between clients' data are ignored. In this work, we focus on a special non-iid FL problem, called Domain-mixed FL, where each client's data distribution is assumed to be a mixture of several predefined domains.  Recognizing the diversity of domains and the similarity within domains, we propose a novel method, FedDAR, which learns a domain shared representation and domain-wise personalized prediction heads in a decoupled manner. For simplified linear regression settings, we have theoretically proved that FedDAR enjoys a linear convergence rate.

While recent object-centric models can successfully decompose a scene into objects, modeling their dynamics effectively still remains a challenge. We address this problem by introducing SlotFormer -- a Transformer-based autoregressive model operating on learned object-centric representations. Given a video clip, our approach reasons over object features to model spatio-temporal relationships and predicts accurate future object states. In this paper, we successfully apply SlotFormer to perform video prediction on datasets with complex object interactions. Moreover, the unsupervised SlotFormer's dynamics model can be used to improve the performance on supervised downstream tasks, such as Visual Question Answering (VQA), and goal-conditioned planning. Compared to past works on dynamics modeling, our method achieves significantly better long-term synthesis of object dynamics, while retaining high quality visual generation. Besides, SlotFormer enables VQA models to reason about the future without object-level labels, even outperforming counterparts that use ground-truth annotations. Finally, we show its ability to serve as a world model for model-based planning, which is competitive with methods designed specifically for such tasks",

This objective is a lower bound on expected returns. Unlike prior bounds for model-based RL on policy exploration or model guarantees, our bound is directly on the overall RL objective.

The key challenge is the estimation of the predictor-corrector term; a naive approach based on sample-average approximation may lead to non-convergence. We develop a general moving-average based method to estimate the predictor-corrector term and provide error bounds for the iterates, both in presence of pure and noisy access to the queries from the relevant derivatives of the loss function.

Unlike existing methods, which optimize for either the worst or the average performance over classes or groups, our work is motivated by the need for finer control over the robustness properties of the model. We present an extremely lightweight post-hoc approach that performs scaling adjustments to predictions from a pre-trained model, with the goal of minimizing a distributionally robust loss around a chosen target distribution. These adjustments are computed by solving a constrained optimization problem on a validation set and applied to the model during test time.

An effort is made to give a specific example to a fundamental question: whether and how one can benefit from the theoretical structure of a mathematical problem to develop task-oriented and structure-conforming deep neural networks? Specifically, inspired by direct sampling methods for inverse problems, the 1D boundary data in different frequencies are preprocessed by a partial differential equation-based feature map to yield 2D harmonic extensions as different input channels. Then, by introducing learnable non-local kernels, the direct sampling is recast to a modified attention mechanism. The new method achieves superior accuracy over its predecessors and contemporary operator learners and shows robustness to noises in benchmarks. \nThis research shall strengthen the insights that, despite being invented for natural language processing tasks, the attention mechanism offers great flexibility to be modified in conformity with the a priori mathematical knowledge, which ultimately leads to the design of more physics-compatible neural architectures",

To this end, recent work has focused on miscalibration, i.e., the over or under confidence of model scores. Yet calibration is not enough: even a perfectly calibrated classifier with the best possible accuracy can have confidence scores that are far from the true posterior probabilities. This is due to the grouping loss, created by samples with the same confidence scores but different true posterior probabilities. Proper scoring rule theory shows that given the calibration loss, the missing piece to characterize individual errors is the grouping loss. While there are many estimators of the calibration loss, none exists for the grouping loss in standard settings. Here, we propose an estimator to approximate the grouping loss. We show that modern neural network architectures in vision and NLP exhibit grouping loss, notably in distribution shifts settings, which highlights the importance of pre-production validation",

We evaluate the generalizability of models trained on in-distribution datasets with the performance on OOD videos and observe a significant performance drop. We further propose a simple yet effective approach, which cuts off the excessive contextual dependency of action steps by performing causal inference, to provide a potential direction for enhancing the OOD generalizability.

In this work, we propose a novel framework DecAF that jointly generates both logical forms and direct answers, and then combines the merits of them to get the final answers. Moreover, different from most of the previous methods, DecAF is based on simple free-text retrieval without relying on any entity linking tools --- this simplification eases its adaptation to different datasets. DecAF achieves new state-of-the-art accuracy on WebQSP, FreebaseQA, and GrailQA benchmarks, while getting competitive results on the ComplexWebQuestions benchmark",

    "title": "Causality Compensated Attention for Contextual Biased Visual Recognition",
    "abstract": "Visual attention does not always capture the essential object representation desired for robust predictions. Attention modules tend to underline not only the target object but also the common co-occurring context that the module thinks helpful in the training. The problem is rooted in the confounding effect of the context leading to incorrect causalities between objects and predictions, which is further exacerbated by visual attention. In this paper, to learn causal object features robust for contextual bias, we propose a novel attention module named Interventional Dual Attention (IDA) for visual recognition. Specifically, IDA adopts two attention layers with multiple sampling intervention, which compensates the attention against the confounder context. Note that our method is model-agnostic and thus can be implemented on various backbones. Extensive experiments show our model obtains significant improvements in classification and detection with lower computation. In particular, we achieve the state-of-the-art results in multi-label classification on MS-COCO and PASCAL-VOC",

    "title": "Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning: Convexity, Stationarity and Pareto Optimality",
    "abstract": "In recent years, single-objective reinforcement learning (SORL) algorithms have received a significant amount of attention and seen some strong results. However, it is generally recognized that many practical problems have intrinsic multi-objective properties that cannot be easily handled by SORL algorithms. Although there have been many multi-objective reinforcement learning (MORL) algorithms proposed, there has been little recent exploration of the fundamental properties of the spaces we are learning in. In this paper, we perform a rigorous analysis of policy induced value functions and use the insights to distinguish three views of Pareto optimality. The results imply the convexity of the induced value function's range for stationary policies and suggest that any point of its Pareto front can be achieved by training a policy using linear scalarization (LS). We show the problem that leads to the suboptimal performance of LS can be solved by adding strongly concave terms to the immediate rewards, which motivates us to propose a new vector reward-based Q-learning algorithm, CAPQL. Combined with an actor-critic formulation, our algorithm achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple MuJoCo tasks in the preference agnostic setting. Furthermore, we empirically show that, in contrast to other LS-based algorithms, our approach is significantly more stable, achieving similar results across various random seeds",

More precisely, experiments performed on real-world datasets showed that our attack could yield up to a 90\\% relative decrease in amplitude of the sensitive feature attribution.

The core of 3DiM is an image-to-image diffusion model -- 3DiM takes a single reference view and their poses as inputs, and generates a novel view via diffusion. 3DiM can then generate a full 3D consistent scene following our novel stochastic conditioning sampler: the output frames of the scene are generated autoregressively, and during the reverse diffusion process of each individual frame, we select a random conditioning frame from the set of previous frames at each denoising step. We demonstrate that stochastic conditioning yields much more 3D consistent results compared to the naive sampling process which only conditions on a single previous frame. We compare 3DiMs to prior work on the SRN ShapeNet dataset, demonstrating that 3DiM's generated videos from a single view achieve much higher fidelity while being approximately 3D consistent. We also introduce a new evaluation methodology, 3D consistency scoring, to measure the 3D consistency of a generated object by training a neural field on the model's output views. 3DiMs are geometry free, do not rely on hyper-networks or test-time optimization for novel view synthesis, and allow a single model to easily scale to a large number of scenes",

The key to this component is a series of carefully designed loss functions to enable every 3D point, especially in non-occupied space, to be effectively optimized even without 3D labels. In addition, we introduce an inverse query algorithm to freely manipulate any specified 3D object shape in the learned scene representation. Notably, our manipulation algorithm can explicitly tackle key issues such as object collisions and visual occlusions. Our method, called DM-NeRF, is among the first to simultaneously reconstruct, decompose, manipulate and render complex 3D scenes in a single pipeline. Extensive experiments on three datasets clearly show that our method can accurately decompose all 3D objects from 2D views, allowing any interested object to be freely manipulated in 3D space such as translation, rotation, size adjustment, and deformation",

    "title": "How to Exploit Hyperspherical Embeddings for Out-of-Distribution Detection?",
    "abstract": "Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is a critical task for reliable machine learning. Recent advances in representation learning give rise to distance-based OOD detection, where testing samples are detected as OOD if they are relatively far away from the centroids or prototypes of in-distribution (ID) classes. However, prior methods directly take off-the-shelf contrastive losses that suffice for classifying ID samples, but are not optimally designed when test inputs contain OOD samples. In this work, we propose CIDER, a novel representation learning framework that exploits hyperspherical embeddings for OOD detection. CIDER jointly optimizes two losses to promote strong ID-OOD separability: a dispersion loss that promotes large angular distances among different class prototypes, and a compactness loss that encourages samples to be close to their class prototypes. We analyze and establish the unexplored relationship between OOD detection performance and the embedding properties in the hyperspherical space, and demonstrate the importance of dispersion and compactness. CIDER establishes superior performance, outperforming the latest rival by 13.33% in FPR95. Code is available at https://github.com/deeplearning-wisc/cider",

IPS achieves this by selecting only the most salient patches, which are then aggregated into a global representation for image recognition. For both patch selection and aggregation, a cross-attention based transformer is introduced, which exhibits a close connection to Multiple Instance Learning. Our method demonstrates strong performance and has wide applicability across different domains, training regimes and image sizes while using minimal accelerator memory.

Recently, the structure of directed acyclic graph has achieved great success in NAT, which tackles the multi-modality problem by introducing dependency between vertices. However, training it with negative log-likelihood loss implicitly requires a strict alignment between reference tokens and vertices, weakening its ability to handle multiple translation modalities. In this paper, we hold the view that all paths in the graph are fuzzily aligned with the reference sentence. We do not require the exact alignment but train the model to maximize a fuzzy alignment score between the graph and reference, which takes captured translations in all modalities into account. Extensive experiments on major WMT benchmarks show that our method substantially improves translation performance and increases prediction confidence, setting a new state of the art for NAT on the raw training data",

    "abstract": "We address the task of open-world class-agnostic object detection, i.e., detecting every object in an image by learning from a limited number of base object classes. State-of-the-art RGB-based models suffer from overfitting the training classes and often fail at detecting novel-looking objects. This is because RGB-based models primarily rely on appearance similarity to detect novel objects and are also prone to overfitting short-cut cues such as textures and discriminative parts. To address these shortcomings of RGB-based object detectors, we propose incorporating geometric cues such as depth and normals, predicted by general-purpose monocular estimators. Specifically, we use the geometric cues to train an object proposal network for pseudo-labeling unannotated novel objects in the training set. Our resulting Geometry-guided Open-world Object Detector (GOOD) significantly improves detection recall for novel object categories and already performs well with only a few training classes. Using a single ``person'' class for training on the COCO dataset, GOOD  surpasses SOTA methods by 5.0% AR@100, a relative improvement of 24%.

In TabCaps, a record is encoded into several vectorial features by some optimizable multivariate Gaussian kernels in the primary capsule layer, where each vectorial feature represents a specific \"profile\" of the input record and is transformed into senior capsule layer under the guidance of a new straightforward routing algorithm. The design of routing algorithm is motivated by the Bag-of-Words (BoW) model, which performs capsule feature grouping straightforwardly and efficiently, in lieu of the computationally complex clustering of previous routing algorithms.

    "title": "Towards Understanding and Mitigating Dimensional Collapse in Heterogeneous Federated Learning",
    "abstract": "Federated learning aims to train models collaboratively across different clients without sharing data for privacy considerations. However, one major challenge for this learning paradigm is the data heterogeneity problem, which refers to the discrepancies between the local data distributions among various clients. To tackle this problem, we first study how data heterogeneity affects the representations of the globally aggregated models. Interestingly, we find that heterogeneous data results in the global model suffering from severe dimensional collapse, in which representations tend to reside in a lower-dimensional space instead of the ambient space. Moreover, we observe a similar phenomenon on models locally trained on each client and deduce that the dimensional collapse on the global model is inherited from local models. In addition, we theoretically analyze the gradient flow dynamics to shed light on how data heterogeneity result in dimensional collapse for local models. To remedy this problem caused by the data heterogeneity, we propose FedDecorr, a novel method that can effectively mitigate dimensional collapse in federated learning. Specifically, FedDecorr applies a regularization term during local training that encourages different dimensions of representations to be uncorrelated. FedDecorr, which is implementation-friendly and computationally-efficient, yields consistent improvements over baselines on standard benchmark datasets. Code: https://github.com/bytedance/FedDecorr",

Specifically, two learned control policies, i.e., the neural deterministic controller (NDC) and the neural stochastic controller (NSC), work effectively in the learning procedures that rely on, respectively, the well-known LaSalle-type theorem and the newly-established theorem for guaranteeing the stochastic stability in SDDEs. We theoretically investigate the performance of the proposed controllers in terms of convergence time and energy cost.

In this work, for smooth and unconstrained problems, we improve the current analysis and show that DP-SGD-GC can achieve a vanishing utility bound without any bias term. Furthermore, when the noise generated from subsampled gradients is light-tailed, we prove that DP-SGD-GC can achieve nearly the same utility bound as DP-SGD applies to the Lipschitz continuous objectives.

    "abstract": "Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) have emerged in the last few years as a powerful tool to encode continuously  a variety of different signals like images, videos, audio and 3D shapes. When applied to 3D shapes, INRs allow to overcome the fragmentation and shortcomings of the popular discrete representations used so far. Yet, considering that INRs consist in neural networks, it is not clear whether and how it may be possible to feed them into deep learning pipelines aimed at solving a downstream task. In this paper, we put forward this research problem and propose inr2vec, a framework that can compute a compact latent representation for an input INR in a single inference pass. We verify that inr2vec can embed effectively the 3D shapes represented by the input INRs and show how the produced embeddings can be fed into deep learning pipelines to solve several tasks by processing exclusively INRs",

    "title": "ImaginaryNet: Learning Object Detectors without Real Images and Annotations",
    "abstract": "Without the demand of training in reality, humans are able of detecting a new category of object simply based on the language description on its visual characteristics. Empowering deep learning with this ability undoubtedly enables the neural network to handle complex vision tasks, e.g., object detection, without collecting and annotating real images. To this end, this paper introduces a novel challenging learning paradigm Imaginary-Supervised Object Detection (ISOD), where neither real images nor manual annotations are allowed for training object detectors. To resolve this challenge, we propose ImaginaryNet, a framework to synthesize images by combining pretrained language model and text-to-image synthesis model. Given a class label, the language model is used to generate a full description of a scene with a target object, and the text-to-image model is deployed to generate a photo-realistic image. With the synthesized images and class labels, weakly supervised object detection can then be leveraged to accomplish ISOD. By gradually introducing real images and manual annotations, ImaginaryNet can collaborate with other supervision settings to further boost detection performance. Experiments show that ImaginaryNet can (i) obtain about 75% performance in ISOD compared with the weakly supervised counterpart of the same backbone trained on real data, (ii) significantly improve the baseline while achieving state-of-the-art or comparable performance by incorporating ImaginaryNet with other supervision settings.

    "title": "Contextual bandits with concave rewards, and an application to fair ranking",
    "abstract": "We consider Contextual Bandits with Concave Rewards (CBCR), a multi-objective bandit problem where the desired trade-off between the rewards is defined by a known concave objective function, and the reward vector depends on an observed stochastic context. We present the first algorithm with provably vanishing regret for CBCR without restrictions on the policy space, whereas prior works were restricted to finite policy spaces or tabular representations. Our solution is based on a geometric interpretation of CBCR algorithms as optimization algorithms over the convex set of expected rewards spanned by all stochastic policies. Building on Frank-Wolfe analyses in constrained convex optimization, we derive a novel reduction from the CBCR regret to the regret of a \\emph{scalar-reward} bandit problem. We illustrate how to apply the reduction off-the-shelf to obtain algorithms for CBCR with both linear and general reward functions, in the case of non-combinatorial actions. Motivated by fairness in recommendation, we describe a special case of CBCR with rankings and fairness-aware objectives, leading to the first algorithm with regret guarantees for contextual combinatorial bandits with fairness of exposure",

    "title": "Learning Zero-Shot Cooperation with Humans, Assuming Humans Are Biased",
    "abstract": "There is a recent trend of applying multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) to train an agent that can cooperate with humans in a zero-shot fashion without using any human data. The typical workflow is to first repeatedly run self-play (SP) to build a policy pool and then train the final adaptive policy against this pool. A crucial limitation of this framework is that every policy in the pool is optimized w.r.t. the environment reward function, which implicitly assumes that the testing partners of the adaptive policy will be precisely optimizing the same reward function as well. However, human objectives are often substantially biased according to their own preferences, which can differ greatly from the environment reward. We propose a more general framework, Hidden-Utility Self-Play (HSP), which explicitly models human biases as hidden reward functions in the self-play objective. By approximating the reward space as linear functions, HSP adopts an effective technique to generate an augmented policy pool with biased policies. We evaluate HSP on the Overcooked benchmark. Empirical results show that our HSP method produces higher rewards than baselines when cooperating with learned human models, manually scripted policies, and real humans. The HSP policy is also rated as the most assistive policy based on human feedback",

The data augmentations used are of crucial importance to the quality of learned feature representations. In this paper, we analyze how the color jitter traditionally used in data augmentation negatively impacts the quality of the color features in learned feature representations. To address this problem, we propose a more realistic, physics-based color data augmentation - which we call Planckian Jitter - that creates realistic variations in chromaticity and produces a model robust to illumination changes that can be commonly observed in real life, while maintaining the ability to discriminate image content based on color information.\nExperiments confirm that such a representation is complementary to the representations learned with the currently-used color jitter augmentation and that a simple concatenation leads to significant performance gains on a wide range of downstream datasets. \nIn addition, we present a color sensitivity analysis that documents the impact of different training methods on model neurons and shows that the performance of the learned features is robust with respect to illuminant variations.\nOfficial code available at: https://github.com/TheZino/PlanckianJitter",

However, it remains unclear how to combine such multi-view methods with the widely available 3D point clouds. Previous methods use unlearned heuristics to combine features at the point level. To this end, we introduce the concept of the multi-view point cloud (Voint cloud), representing each 3D point as a set of features extracted from several view-points. This novel 3D Voint cloud representation combines the compactness of 3D point cloud representation with the natural view-awareness of multi-view representation. Naturally, we can equip this new representation with convolutional and pooling operations. We deploy a Voint neural network (VointNet) to learn representations in the Voint space. Our novel representation achieves state-of-the-art performance on 3D classification, shape retrieval, and robust 3D part segmentation on standard benchmarks ( ScanObjectNN, ShapeNet Core55, and ShapeNet Parts). Further analysis shows that VointNet improves the robustness to occlusion compared to other methods",

    "abstract": "A locality-sensitive hash (or LSH) is a function that can efficiently map dataset points into a latent space while preserving pairwise distances. Such LSH functions have been used in approximate nearest-neighbor search (ANNS) in the following classic way, which we call classic hash clustering (CHC): first, the dataset points are hashed into a low-dimensional binary space using the LSH function; then, the points are clustered by these hash values. Upon receiving a query, its nearest neighbors are sought within its hash-cluster and nearby hash-clusters (i.e., multi-probe). However, CHC mandates a low-dimensional latent space for the LSH function, which distorts distances from the (high-dimensional) original real space; this results in inferior recall. This is often mitigated through using multiple hash tables at additional storage and memory costs.\n\nIn this paper, we introduce a better way of using LSH functions for ANNS. Our method, called the Polar Code Nearest-Neighbor (PCNN) algorithm, uses modern error-correcting codes (specifically polar codes) to maintain a manageable number of clusters inside a high-dimensional latent space. Allowing the LSH function to embed into this high-dimensional latent space results in higher recall, as the embedding faithfully captures distances in the original space. The crux of PCNN is using polar codes for probing: we present a multi-probe scheme for PCNN which uses efficient list-decoding methods for polar codes, with time complexity independent of the dataset size. Fixing the choice of LSH, experiment results demonstrate significant performance gains of PCNN over CHC; in particular, PCNN with a single table outperforms CHC with multiple tables, obviating the need for large memory and storage",

Some pioneer works have achieved encouraging results on RGB-D SLAM. In this paper, we present a dense RGB SLAM method with neural implicit map representation. To reach this challenging goal without depth input, we introduce a hierarchical feature volume to facilitate the implicit map decoder. This design effectively fuses shape cues across different scales to facilitate map reconstruction. Our method simultaneously solves the camera motion and the neural implicit map by matching the rendered and input video frames. To facilitate optimization, we further propose a photometric warping loss in the spirit of multi-view stereo to better constrain the camera pose and scene geometry. We evaluate our method on commonly used benchmarks and compare it with modern RGB and RGB-D SLAM systems.

    "abstract": "Monocular scene reconstruction from posed images is challenging due to the complexity of a large environment. Recent volumetric methods learn to directly predict the TSDF volume and have demonstrated promising results in this task. However, most methods focus on how to extract and fuse the 2D features to a 3D feature volume, but none of them improve the way how the 3D volume is aggregated. In this work, we propose an SDF transformer network, which replaces the role of 3D CNN for better 3D feature aggregation. To reduce the explosive computation complexity of the 3D multi-head attention, we propose a sparse window attention module, where the attention is only calculated between the non-empty voxels within a local window. Then a top-down-bottom-up 3D attention network is built for 3D feature aggregation, where a dilate-attention structure is proposed to prevent geometry degeneration, and two global modules are employed to equip with global receptive fields. The experiments on multiple datasets show that this 3D transformer network generates a more accurate and complete reconstruction, which outperforms previous methods by a large margin. Remarkably, the mesh accuracy is improved by 41.8%, and the mesh completeness is improved by 25.3% on the ScanNet dataset. The code of our method will be made public",

Motivated from entirely different viewpoints, their loss functions appear to be unrelated. In practice, they yield strongly differing embeddings and can suggest conflicting interpretations of the same data. The fundamental reasons for this and, more generally, the exact relationship between \nt\n-SNE and UMAP have remained unclear. In this work, we uncover their conceptual connection via a new insight into contrastive learning methods. Noise-contrastive estimation can be used to optimize \nt\n-SNE, while UMAP relies on negative sampling, another contrastive method. We find the precise relationship between these two contrastive methods, and provide a mathematical characterization of the distortion introduced by negative sampling. Visually, this distortion results in UMAP generating more compact embeddings with tighter clusters compared to \nt\n-SNE. We exploit this new conceptual connection to propose and implement a generalization of negative sampling, allowing us to interpolate between (and even extrapolate beyond) \nt\n-SNE and UMAP and their respective embeddings. Moving along this spectrum of embeddings leads to a trade-off between discrete / local and continuous / global structures, mitigating the risk of over-interpreting ostensible features of any single embedding.

    "title": "D4AM: A General Denoising Framework for Downstream Acoustic Models",
    "abstract": "The performance of acoustic models degrades notably in noisy environments. Speech enhancement (SE) can be used as a front-end strategy to aid automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems. However, existing training objectives of SE methods are not fully effective at integrating speech-text and noise-clean paired data for training toward unseen ASR systems. In this study, we propose a general denoising framework, D4AM, for various downstream acoustic models. Our framework fine-tunes the SE model with the backward gradient according to a specific acoustic model and the corresponding classification objective. In addition, our method aims to consider the regression objective as an auxiliary loss to make the SE model generalize to other unseen acoustic models. To jointly train an SE unit with regression and classification objectives, D4AM uses an adjustment scheme to directly estimate suitable weighting coefficients rather than undergoing a grid search process with additional training costs. The adjustment scheme consists of two parts: gradient calibration and regression objective weighting. The experimental results show that D4AM can consistently and effectively provide improvements to various unseen acoustic models and outperforms other combination setups. Specifically, when evaluated on the Google ASR API with real noisy data completely unseen during SE training, D4AM achieves a relative WER reduction of 24.65% compared with the direct feeding of noisy input. To our knowledge, this is the first work that deploys an effective combination scheme of regression (denoising) and classification (ASR) objectives to derive a general pre-processor applicable to various unseen ASR systems.

    "abstract": "Large-scale Vehicle Routing Problems (VRPs) are widely used in logistics, transportation, supply chain, and robotic systems. Recently, data-driven VRP heuristics are proposed to generate real-time VRP solutions with up to 100 nodes. Despite this progress, current heuristics for large-scale VRPs still face three major challenges: 1) Difficulty in generalizing the heuristics learned on small-scale VRPs to large-scale VRPs without retraining; 2) Challenge in generating real-time solutions for large-scale VRPs; 3) Difficulty in embedding global constraints into learned heuristics. We contribute in the three directions: We propose a Two-stage Divide Method (TAM) to generate sub-route sequence rather than node sequence for generalizing the heuristics learned on small-scale VRPs to solve large-scale VRPs in real-time. A  two-step reinforcement learning method with new reward and padding techniques is proposed to train our TAM.  A global mask function is proposed to keep the global constraints satisfied when dividing a large-scale VRP into several small-scale Traveling Salesman Problems (TSPs). As result, we can solve the small-scale TSPs in parallel quickly. The experiments on synthetic and real-world large-scale VRPs show our method could generalize the learned heuristics trained on datasets of VRP 100 to solve VRPs with over 5000 nodes in real-time while keeping the solution quality better than data-driven heuristics and competitive with traditional heuristics",

To this end, we define a kind of \n(\nσ\n,\nδ\n)\n-measure to mathematically quantify the data augmentation, and then provide an upper bound of the downstream classification error rate based on the measure. It reveals that the generalization ability of contrastive self-supervised learning is related to three key factors: alignment of positive samples, divergence of class centers, and concentration of augmented data. The first two factors are properties of learned representations, while the third one is determined by pre-defined data augmentation. We further investigate two canonical contrastive losses, InfoNCE and cross-correlation, to show how they provably achieve the first two factors. Moreover, we conduct experiments to study the third factor, and observe a strong correlation between downstream performance and the concentration of augmented data",

(2) Alongside the contrastive objective, we propose contextual shape prediction to bring more task-relevant information for unsupervised 3D point cloud representation learning and we also provide a theoretical analysis for this pre-training goal. (3) As compared to previous methods, representation learned by CO3 is able to be transferred to different outdoor scene dataset collected by different type of LiDAR sensors.

Its performance suffers from the non-vanishing biases introduced by the local inconsistent optimal and the rugged client-drifts by the local over-fitting. In this paper, we propose a novel and practical method, FedSpeed, to alleviate the negative impacts posed by these problems.  Concretely, FedSpeed applies the prox-correction term on the current local updates to efficiently reduce the biases introduced by the prox-term, a necessary regularizer to maintain the strong local consistency. Furthermore, FedSpeed merges the vanilla stochastic gradient with a perturbation computed from an extra gradient ascent step in the neighborhood, thereby alleviating the issue of local over-fitting. Our theoretical analysis indicates that the convergence rate is related to both the communication rounds \nT\n and local intervals \nK\n with a tighter upper bound \nO\n(\n1\nT\n)\n if \nK\n=\nO\n(\nT\n)\n.  Moreover, we conduct extensive experiments on the real-world dataset to demonstrate the efficiency of our proposed FedSpeed, which converges significantly faster and achieves the state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on the general FL experimental settings than several baselines including FedAvg, FedProx, FedCM, FedAdam, SCAFFOLD, FedDyn, FedADMM, etc",

    "abstract": "Gradient inversion attacks have posed a serious threat to the privacy of federated learning. The attacks search for the optimal pair of input and label best matching the shared gradients and the search space of the attacks can be reduced by pre-restoring labels. Recently, label restoration technique allows for the extraction of labels from gradients analytically, but even the state-of-the-art remains limited to identify the presence of categories (i.e., the class-wise label restoration). This work considers the more real-world settings, where there are multiple instances of each class in a training batch. An analytic method is proposed to perform instance-wise batch label restoration from only the gradient of the final layer. On the basis of the approximate recovered class-wise embeddings and post-softmax probabilities, we establish linear equations of the gradients, probabilities and labels to derive the Number of Instances (NoI) per class by the Moore-Penrose pseudoinverse algorithm. Our experimental evaluations reach over 99% Label existence Accuracy (LeAcc) and exceed 96% Label number Accuracy (LnAcc) in most cases on three image datasets and four classification models. The two metrics are used to evaluate class-wise and instance-wise label restoration accuracy, respectively. And the recovery is made feasible even with a batch size of 4096 and partially negative activations (e.g., Leaky ReLU and Swish). Furthermore, we demonstrate that our method facilitates the existing gradient inversion attacks by exploiting the recovered labels, with an increase of 6-7 in PSNR on both MNIST and CIFAR100.

Such a methodology is referred to as Gradient Re-parameterization, and the optimizers are named RepOptimizers. For the extreme simplicity of model structure, we focus on a VGG-style plain model and showcase that such a simple model trained with a RepOptimizer, which is referred to as RepOpt-VGG, performs on par with or better than the recent well-designed models. From a practical perspective, RepOpt-VGG is a favorable base model because of its simple structure, high inference speed and training efficiency. Compared to Structural Re-parameterization, which adds priors into models via constructing extra training-time structures, RepOptimizers require no extra forward/backward computations and solve the problem of quantization. We hope to spark further research beyond the realms of model structure design. Code and models https://github.com/DingXiaoH/RepOptimizers",

    "title": "Protein Representation Learning via Knowledge Enhanced Primary Structure Reasoning",
    "abstract": "Protein representation learning has primarily benefited from the remarkable development of language models (LMs). Accordingly, pre-trained protein models also suffer from a problem in LMs: a lack of factual knowledge. The recent solution models the relationships between protein and associated knowledge terms as the knowledge encoding objective. However, it fails to explore the relationships at a more granular level, i.e., the token level. To mitigate this, we propose Knowledge-exploited Auto-encoder for Protein (KeAP), which performs token-level knowledge graph exploration for protein representation learning. In practice, non-masked amino acids iteratively query the associated knowledge tokens to extract and integrate helpful information for restoring masked amino acids via attention. We show that KeAP can consistently outperform the previous counterpart on 9 representative downstream applications, sometimes surpassing it by large margins. These results suggest that KeAP provides an alternative yet effective way to perform knowledge enhanced protein representation learning",

    "abstract": "Self-supervised methods have become crucial for advancing deep learning by leveraging data itself to reduce the need for expensive annotations. However, the question of how to conduct self-supervised offline reinforcement learning (RL) in a principled way remains unclear.\nIn this paper, we address this issue by investigating the theoretical benefits of utilizing reward-free data in linear Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) within a semi-supervised setting. Further, we propose a novel, Provable Data Sharing algorithm (PDS) to utilize such reward-free data for offline RL. PDS uses additional penalties on the reward function learned from labeled data to prevent overestimation, ensuring a conservative algorithm. Our results on various offline RL tasks demonstrate that PDS significantly improves the performance of offline RL algorithms with reward-free data. Overall, our work provides a promising approach to leveraging the benefits of unlabeled data in offline RL while maintaining theoretical guarantees.

    "abstract": "Recently multi-lingual pre-trained language models (PLM) such as mBERT and XLM-R have achieved impressive strides in cross-lingual dense retrieval. Despite its successes, they are general-purpose PLM while the multilingual PLM tailored for cross-lingual retrieval is still unexplored. Motivated by an observation that the sentences in parallel documents are approximately in the same order, which is universal across languages, we propose to model this sequential sentence relation to facilitate cross-lingual representation learning. Specifically, we propose a multilingual PLM called masked sentence model (MSM), which consists of a sentence encoder to generate the sentence representations, and a document encoder applied to a sequence of sentence vectors from a document. The document encoder is shared for all languages to model the universal sequential sentence relation across languages. To train the model, we propose a masked sentence prediction task, which masks and predicts the sentence vector via a hierarchical contrastive loss with sampled negatives. Comprehensive experiments on four cross-lingual retrieval tasks show MSM significantly outperforms existing advanced pre-training models, demonstrating the effectiveness and stronger cross-lingual retrieval capabilities of our approach",

MIM recently dominates this line of research with state-of-the-art performance on vision Transformers (ViTs), where the core is to enhance the patch-level visual context capturing of the network via denoising auto-encoding mechanism. Rather than tailoring image tokenizers with extra training stages as in previous works, we unleash the great potential of contrastive learning on de- noising auto-encoding and introduce a pure MIM method, ConMIM, to produce simple intra-image inter-patch contrastive constraints as the sole learning objectives for masked patch prediction. We further strengthen the denoising mechanism with asymmetric designs, including image perturbations and model progress rates, to improve the network pre-training. ConMIM-pretrained models with various scales achieve competitive results on downstream image classification, semantic segmentation, object detection, and instance segmentation tasks, e.g., on ImageNet-1K classification, we achieve 83.9% top-1 accuracy with ViT-Small and 85.3% with ViT-Base without extra data for pre-training.

Even though this has greatly promoted the development of multi-agent reinforcement learning  (MARL), it is still not enough to support further exploration on the behavior of swarm intelligence between multiple teams, and cooperation between multiple agents due to their limited scalability. To alleviate this, we introduce GoBigger, a scalable platform for cooperative-competition multi-agent interactive simulation. GoBigger is an enhanced environment for the Agar-like game, enabling the simulation of multiple scales of agent intra-team cooperation and inter-team competition. Compared with existing multi-agent simulation environments, our platform supports multi-team games with more than two teams simultaneously, which dramatically expands the diversity of agent cooperation and competition, and can more effectively simulate the swarm intelligent agent behavior. Besides, in GoBigger, the cooperation between the agents in a team can lead to much higher performance. We offer a diverse set of challenging scenarios, built-in bots, and visualization tools for best practices in benchmarking. We evaluate several state-of-the-art algorithms on GoBigger and demonstrate the potential of the environment. We believe this platform can inspire various emerging research directions in MARL, swarm intelligence, and large-scale agent interactive learning.

    "abstract": "State-of-the-art computer vision models are mostly trained with supervised learning using human-labeled images, which limits their scalability due to the expensive annotation cost. While self-supervised representation learning has achieved impressive progress, it still requires a second stage of finetuning on labeled data. On the other hand, models pre-trained with large-scale text supervision (e.g., CLIP) have enabled zero-shot transfer to downstream image classification tasks. However, the zero-shot performance of CLIP-like models are often insufficient for real-world adoption. In this paper, we aim to leverage the abundant unlabeled data from a target domain to improve the performance of a pre-trained zero-shot classifier, by unsupervised finetuning of the pre-trained model. We propose Masked Unsupervised Self-Training (MUST), a new approach which leverages two different and complimentary sources of training signals: pseudo-labels and raw images. MUST jointly optimizes three objectives to learn both class-level global feature and pixel-level local feature and enforces a regularization between the two. We demonstrate the efficacy of MUST on 8 downstream tasks across a variety of domains, where it improves upon CLIP by a large margin. MUST also outperforms supervised few-shot adaptation methods. It achieves a top-1 accuracy of 77.7% on ImageNet using ViT-B, +9.4% higher than CLIP, and +6.2% higher than 16-shot CLIP adaptation. Our code is available at https://github.com/salesforce/MUST",

In this work, we propose GeneFace, a generalized and high-fidelity NeRF-based talking face generation method, which can generate natural results corresponding to various out-of-domain audio. Specifically, we learn a variational motion generator on a large lip-reading corpus, and introduce a domain adaptative post-net to calibrate the result. Moreover, we learn a NeRF-based renderer conditioned on the predicted motion. A head-aware torso-NeRF is proposed to eliminate the head-torso separation problem.

In this paper, we study the sim-to-real transfer in continuous domain with partial observations, where the simulated environments and real-world environments are modeled by linear quadratic Gaussian (LQG) systems. We show that a popular robust adversarial training algorithm is capable of learning a policy from the simulated environment that is competitive to the optimal policy in the real-world environment.

To this end, we study weight decay regularized training problems of deep neural networks with threshold activations. We first show that regularized deep threshold network training problems can be equivalently formulated as a standard convex optimization problem, which parallels the LASSO method, provided that the last hidden layer width exceeds a certain threshold. We also derive a simplified convex optimization formulation when the dataset can be shattered at a certain layer of the network.

Although deep generative models and geometric deep learning have made great progress in drug design, existing works either sample in the 2D graph space or fail to generate valid molecules with realistic substructures. To tackle these problems, we propose a Fragment-based LigAnd Generation framework (FLAG), to generate 3D molecules with valid and realistic substructures fragment-by-fragment. In FLAG, a motif vocabulary is constructed by extracting common molecular fragments (i.e., motif) in the dataset. At each generation step, a 3D graph neural network is first employed to encode the intermediate context information. Then, our model selects the focal motif, predicts the next motif type, and attaches the new motif. The bond lengths/angles can be quickly and accurately determined by cheminformatics tools. Finally, the molecular geometry is further adjusted according to the predicted rotation angle and the structure refinement. Our model not only achieves competitive performances on conventional metrics such as binding affinity, QED, and SA, but also outperforms baselines by a large margin in generating molecules with realistic substructures",

Existing robustness certification methods aim to provide robustness guarantees for each sample with respect to the worst-case perturbations given a neural network. However, those sample-wise bounds will be loose when considering the UP threat model as they overlook the important constraint that the perturbation should be shared across all samples. We propose a method based on a combination of linear relaxation-based perturbation analysis and Mixed Integer Linear Programming to establish the first robust certification method for UP. In addition, we develop a theoretical framework for computing error bounds on the entire population using the certification results from a randomly sampled batch. Aside from an extensive evaluation of the proposed certification, we further show how the certification facilitates efficient comparison of robustness among different models or efficacy among different universal adversarial attack defenses and enables accurate detection of backdoor target classes",

    "abstract": "Deep generative models (DGMs) are data-eager because learning a complex model on limited data suffers from a large variance and easily overfits. Inspired by the classical perspective of the bias-variance tradeoff, we propose regularized deep generative model (Reg-DGM), which leverages a nontransferable pre-trained model to reduce the variance of generative modeling with limited data. Formally, Reg-DGM optimizes a weighted sum of a certain divergence and the expectation of an energy function, where the divergence is between the data and the model distributions, and the energy function is defined by the pre-trained model w.r.t. the model distribution. We analyze a simple yet representative Gaussian-fitting case to demonstrate how the weighting hyperparameter trades off the bias and the variance. Theoretically, we characterize the existence and the uniqueness of the global minimum of Reg-DGM in a non-parametric setting and prove its convergence with neural networks trained by gradient-based methods. Empirically, with various pre-trained feature extractors and a data-dependent energy function, Reg-DGM consistently improves the generation performance of strong DGMs with limited data and achieves competitive results to the state-of-the-art methods.

Federated learning (FL) serves as a privacy-conscious alternative to centralized machine learning. However, existing FL methods extended to multimodal data all rely on model aggregation on single modality level, which restrains the server and clients to have identical model architecture for each modality. This limits the global model in terms of both model complexity and data capacity, not to mention task diversity. In this work, we propose \\textit{Contrastive Representation Ensemble and Aggregation for Multimodal FL (CreamFL)}, a multimodal federated learning framework that enables training larger server models from clients with heterogeneous model architectures and data modalities, while only communicating knowledge on public dataset. To achieve better multimodal representation fusion, we design a global-local cross-modal ensemble strategy to aggregate client representations. To mitigate local model drift caused by two unprecedented heterogeneous factors stemming from multimodal discrepancy (\\textit{modality gap} and \\textit{task gap}), we further propose two inter-modal and intra-modal contrasts to regularize local training, which complements information of the absent modality for uni-modal clients and regularizes local clients to head towards global consensus.

Specifically, in terms of robustness on out-of-distribution samples, recent research finds that Transformers are inherently more robust than CNNs, regardless of different training setups. Moreover, it is believed that such superiority of Transformers should largely be credited to their \\emph{self-attention-like architectures per se}. In this paper, we question that belief by closely examining the design of Transformers. Our findings lead to three highly effective architecture designs for boosting robustness, yet simple enough to be implemented in several lines of code, namely a) patchifying input images, b) enlarging kernel size, and c) reducing activation layers and normalization layers. Bringing these components together, we are able to build pure CNN architectures without any attention-like operations that are as robust as, or even more robust than, Transformers.

Recently, an interesting attempt is stochastic weight averaging (SWA), which significantly improves the generalization by simply averaging the solutions at the tail stage of training. In this paper, we realize that the averaging coefficients could be determined in a trainable manner and propose Trainable Weight Averaging (TWA), a novel optimization method in the reduced subspace spanned by historical solutions. TWA has much greater flexibility and can be applied to the head stage of training to achieve training efficiency while preserving good generalization capability. Further, we propose a distributed training scheme to resolve the memory burden of large-scale training with efficient parallel computation. In the extensive numerical experiments, (i) TWA achieves consistent improvements over SWA with less sensitivity to learning rate; (ii) applying TWA in the head stage of training largely speeds up the convergence, resulting in over \n40\n%\n time saving on CIFAR and \n30\n%\n on ImageNet with improved generalization compared with regular training",

Existing approaches to differentiable DTW either differentiate through a fixed warping path or apply a differentiable relaxation to the min operator found in the recursive steps used to solve the DTW problem. We instead propose a DTW layer based around bi-level optimisation and deep declarative networks, which we name DecDTW. By formulating DTW as a continuous, inequality constrained optimisation problem, we can compute gradients for the solution of the optimal alignment (with respect to the underlying time series) using implicit differentiation. An interesting byproduct of this formulation is that DecDTW outputs the optimal warping path between two time series as opposed to a soft approximation, recoverable from Soft-DTW. We show that this property is particularly useful for applications where downstream loss functions are defined on the optimal alignment path itself. This naturally occurs, for instance, when learning to improve the accuracy of predicted alignments against ground truth alignments. We evaluate DecDTW on two such applications, namely the audio-to-score alignment task in music information retrieval and the visual place recognition task in robotics, demonstrating state-of-the-art results in both",

    "abstract": "Finding multiple solutions of non-convex optimization problems is a ubiquitous yet challenging task. Most past algorithms either apply single-solution optimization methods from multiple random initial guesses or search in the vicinity of found solutions using ad hoc heuristics. We present an end-to-end method to learn the proximal operator of a family of training problems so that multiple local minima can be quickly obtained from initial guesses by iterating the learned operator, emulating the proximal-point algorithm that has fast convergence. The learned proximal operator can be further generalized to recover multiple optima for unseen problems at test time, enabling applications such as object detection. The key ingredient in our formulation is a proximal regularization term, which elevates the convexity of our training loss: by applying recent theoretical results, we show that for weakly-convex objectives with Lipschitz gradients, training of the proximal operator converges globally with a practical degree of over-parameterization. We further present an exhaustive benchmark for multi-solution optimization to demonstrate the effectiveness of our method",

    "abstract": "Modern deep learning systems are increasingly deployed in situations such as personalization and federated learning where it is necessary to support i) learning on small amounts of data, and ii) communication efficient distributed training protocols. In this work, we develop FiLM Transfer (FiT) which fulfills these requirements in the image classification setting by combining ideas from transfer learning (fixed pretrained backbones and fine-tuned FiLM adapter layers) and meta-learning (automatically configured Naive Bayes classifiers and episodic training) to yield parameter efficient models with superior classification accuracy at low-shot. The resulting parameter efficiency is key for enabling few-shot learning, inexpensive model updates for personalization, and communication efficient federated learning. We experiment with FiT on a wide range of downstream datasets and show that it achieves better classification accuracy than the leading Big Transfer (BiT) algorithm at low-shot and achieves state-of-the art accuracy on the challenging VTAB-1k benchmark, with fewer than 1% of the updateable parameters. Finally, we demonstrate the parameter efficiency and superior accuracy of FiT in distributed low-shot applications including model personalization and federated learning where model update size is an important performance metric",

    "abstract": "Diffusion probabilistic models (DPMs) have become a popular approach to conditional generation, due to their promising results and support for cross-modal synthesis. A key desideratum in conditional synthesis is to achieve high correspondence between the conditioning input and generated output. Most existing methods learn such relationships implicitly, by incorporating the prior into the variational lower bound. In this work, we take a different route---we explicitly enhance input-output connections by maximizing their mutual information. To this end, we introduce a Conditional Discrete Contrastive Diffusion (CDCD) loss and design two contrastive diffusion mechanisms to effectively incorporate it into the denoising process, combining the diffusion training and contrastive learning for the first time by connecting it with the conventional variational objectives. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach in evaluations with diverse multimodal conditional synthesis tasks: dance-to-music generation, text-to-image synthesis, as well as class-conditioned image synthesis. On each, we enhance the input-output correspondence and achieve higher or competitive general synthesis quality. Furthermore, the proposed approach improves the convergence of diffusion models, reducing the number of required diffusion steps by more than 35% on two benchmarks, significantly increasing the inference speed",

We propose to learn a distribution over diverse and longer protein backbone structures via an E(3)-equivariant graph neural network. We develop SMCDiff to efficiently sample scaffolds from this distribution conditioned on a given motif; our algorithm is the first to theoretically guarantee conditional samples from a diffusion model in the large-compute limit.

    "title": "Private Federated Learning Without a Trusted Server: Optimal Algorithms for Convex Losses",
    "abstract": "This paper studies federated learning (FL)—especially cross-silo FL—with data from people who do not trust the server or other silos. In this setting, each silo (e.g. hospital) has data from different people (e.g. patients) and must maintain the privacy of each person’s data (e.g. medical record), even if the server or other silos act as adversarial eavesdroppers. This requirement motivates the study of Inter-Silo Record-Level Differential Privacy (ISRL-DP), which requires silo \ni\n’s communications to satisfy record/item-level differential privacy (DP). ISRL-DP ensures that the data of each person (e.g. patient) in silo \ni\n (e.g. hospital \ni\n) cannot be leaked. ISRL-DP is different from well-studied privacy notions. Central and user-level DP assume that people trust the server/other silos. On the other end of the spectrum, local DP assumes that people do not trust anyone at all (even their own silo). Sitting between central and local DP, ISRL-DP makes the realistic assumption (in cross-silo FL) that people trust their own silo, but not the server or other silos. In this work, we provide tight (up to logarithms) upper and lower bounds for ISRL-DP FL with convex/strongly convex loss functions and homogeneous (i.i.d.) silo data. Remarkably, we show that similar bounds are attainable for smooth losses with arbitrary heterogeneous silo data distributions, via an accelerated ISRL-DP algorithm. We also provide tight upper and lower bounds for ISRL-DP federated empirical risk minimization, and use acceleration to attain the optimal bounds in fewer rounds of communication than the state-of-the-art. Finally, with a secure “shuffler” to anonymize silo messages (but without a trusted server), our algorithm attains the optimal central DP rates under more practical trust assumptions. Numerical experiments show favorable privacy-accuracy tradeoffs for our algorithm in classification and regression tasks",

Most existing approaches facilitate inter-agent communication by allowing agents to send messages to each other through free communication channels, i.e., \\emph{cheap talk channels}. Current methods require these channels to be constantly accessible and known to the agents a priori. In this work, we lift these requirements such that the agents must discover the cheap talk channels and learn how to use them. Hence, the problem has two main parts: \\emph{cheap talk discovery} (CTD) and \\emph{cheap talk utilization} (CTU).

Such architectural scheme attributes RevCol very different behavior from conventional networks: during forward propagation, features in RevCol are learned to be gradually disentangled when passing through each column, whose total information is maintained rather than compressed or discarded as other network does. Our experiments suggest that CNN-style RevCol models can achieve very competitive performances on multiple computer vision tasks such as image classification, object detection and semantic segmentation, especially with large parameter budget and large dataset. For example, after ImageNet-22K pre-training, RevCol-XL obtains 88.2% ImageNet-1K accuracy. Given more pre-training data, our largest model RevCol-H reaches 90.0% on ImageNet-1K, 63.8% AP\nb\no\nx\n on COCO detection minival set, 61.0% mIoU on ADE20k segmentation. To our knowledge, it is the best COCO detection and ADE20k segmentation result among pure (static) CNN models.

    "abstract": "Equipping predicted segmentation with calibrated uncertainty is essential for safety-critical applications. In this work, we focus on capturing the data-inherent uncertainty (aka aleatoric uncertainty) in segmentation, typically when ambiguities exist in input images. Due to the high-dimensional output space and potential multiple modes in segmenting ambiguous images, it remains challenging to predict well-calibrated uncertainty for segmentation. To tackle this problem, we propose a novel mixture of stochastic experts (MoSE) model, where each expert network estimates a distinct mode of the aleatoric uncertainty and a gating network predicts the probabilities of an input image being segmented in those modes. This yields an efficient two-level uncertainty representation. To learn the model, we develop a Wasserstein-like loss that directly minimizes the distribution distance between the MoSE and ground truth annotations. The loss can easily integrate traditional segmentation quality measures and be efficiently optimized via constraint relaxation. We validate our method on the LIDC-IDRI dataset and a modified multimodal Cityscapes dataset.

Theoretically, we use our proposed basis function decomposition to establish the convergence of gradient descent (GD) on several representative learning tasks. In particular, we improve the convergence of GD on symmetric matrix factorization and provide a completely new convergence result for the orthogonal symmetric tensor decomposition. Empirically, we illustrate the promise of our proposed framework on realistic deep neural networks (DNNs) across different architectures, gradient-based solvers, and datasets. Our key finding is that gradient-based algorithms monotonically learn the coefficients of a particular orthonormal function basis of DNNs defined as the eigenvectors of the conjugate kernel after training",

    "title": "What Is Missing in IRM Training and Evaluation? Challenges and Solutions",
    "abstract": "Invariant risk minimization (IRM) has received increasing attention as a way to acquire environment-agnostic data representations and predictions, and also a principled solution for preventing spurious correlations from being learned and improving models’ out-of-distribution generalization. Yet, recent works have found that the optimality of the originally-proposed IRM optimization (IRMV1) may be compromised in practice or could be impossible to achieve in some scenarios. Therefore, a series of advanced IRM algorithms have been developed that show practical improvement over IRMV1. In this work, we revisit these recent IRM advancements and identify and resolve three practical limitations in IRM training and evaluation. First, we find that the effect of batch size during training has been chronically overlooked in previous studies, leaving room for further improvement. We propose small-batch training and highlight the improvements over a set of large-batch optimization techniques. Second, we find that improper selection of evaluation environments could give a false sense of invariance for IRM. To alleviate this effect, we leverage diversified test-time environments to precisely characterize the invariance of IRM when applied in practice. Third, we revisit Ahuja et al. (2020)’s proposal to convert IRM into an ensemble game and identify a limitation when a single invariant predictor is desired instead of an ensemble of individual predictors. We propose a new IRM variant to address this limitation based on a novel viewpoint of ensemble IRM games as consensus-constrained bi-level optimization. Lastly, we conduct extensive experiments (covering 7 existing IRM variants and 7 datasets) to justify the practical significance of revisiting IRM training and evaluation in a principled manner",

    "title": "Multi-task Self-supervised Graph Neural Networks Enable Stronger Task Generalization",
    "abstract": "Self-supervised learning (SSL) for graph neural networks (GNNs) has attracted increasing attention from the graph machine learning community in recent years, owing to its capability to learn performant node embeddings without costly label information. One weakness of conventional SSL frameworks for GNNs is that they learn through a single philosophy, such as mutual information maximization or generative reconstruction. When applied to various downstream tasks, these frameworks rarely perform equally well for every task, because one philosophy may not span the extensive knowledge required for all tasks. To enhance the task generalization across tasks, as an important first step forward in exploring fundamental graph models, we introduce PARETOGNN, a multi-task SSL framework for node representation learning over graphs. Specifically, PARETOGNN is self-supervised by manifold pretext tasks observing multiple philosophies. To reconcile different philosophies, we explore a multiple-gradient descent algorithm, such that PARETOGNN actively learns from every pretext task while minimizing potential conflicts. We conduct comprehensive experiments over four downstream tasks (i.e., node classification, node clustering, link prediction, and partition prediction), and our proposal achieves the best overall performance across tasks on 11 widely adopted benchmark datasets. Besides, we observe that learning from multiple philosophies enhances not only the task generalization but also the single task performances, demonstrating that PARETOGNN achieves better task generalization via the disjoint yet complementary knowledge learned from different philosophies.

Although soft trees can take various architectures, their impact is not theoretically well known. In this paper, we formulate and analyze the Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) induced by soft tree ensembles for arbitrary tree architectures. This kernel leads to the remarkable finding that only the number of leaves at each depth is relevant for the tree architecture in ensemble learning with an infinite number of trees. In other words, if the number of leaves at each depth is fixed, the training behavior in function space and the generalization performance are exactly the same across different tree architectures, even if they are not isomorphic. We also show that the NTK of asymmetric trees like decision lists does not degenerate when they get infinitely deep. This is in contrast to the perfect binary trees, whose NTK is known to degenerate and leads to worse generalization performance for deeper trees",

A representative MIM model, the masked auto-encoder (MAE), randomly masks a subset of image patches and reconstructs the masked patches given the unmasked patches. Concurrently, many recent works in self-supervised learning utilize the student/teacher paradigm which provides the student with an additional target based on the output of a teacher composed of an exponential moving average (EMA) of previous students. Although common, relatively little is known about the dynamics of the interaction between the student and teacher. \nThrough analysis on a simple linear model, we find that the teacher conditionally removes previous gradient directions based on feature similarities which effectively acts as a conditional momentum regularizer. From this analysis, we present a simple SSL method, the Reconstruction-Consistent Masked Auto-Encoder (RC-MAE) by adding an EMA teacher to MAE. We find that RC-MAE converges faster and requires less memory usage than state-of-the-art self-distillation methods during pre-training, which may provide a way to enhance the practicality of prohibitively expensive self-supervised learning of Vision Transformer models. Additionally, we show that RC-MAE achieves more robustness and better performance compared to MAE on downstream tasks such as ImageNet-1K classification, object detection, and instance segmentation",

    "abstract": "The field of Natural Language Processing (NLP) has experienced a dramatic leap in capabilities with the recent introduction of huge Language Models (LMs). Despite this success, natural language problems that involve several compounded steps are still practically unlearnable, even by the largest LMs. This complies with experimental failures for end-to-end learning of composite problems that were demonstrated in a variety of domains. An effective mitigation is to introduce intermediate supervision for solving sub-tasks of the compounded problem. Recently, several works have demonstrated high gains by taking a straightforward approach for incorporating intermediate supervision in compounded natural language problems: the sequence-to-sequence LM is fed with an augmented input, in which the decomposed tasks' labels are simply concatenated to the original input. In this paper, we prove a positive learning result that motivates these recent efforts. We show that when concatenating intermediate supervision to the input and training a sequence-to-sequence model on this modified input, unlearnable composite problems can become learnable. We show that this is true for any family of tasks which on the one hand, are unlearnable, and on the other hand, can be decomposed into a polynomial number of simple sub-tasks, each of which depends only on \nO\n(\n1\n)\n previous sub-task results. Beyond motivating contemporary empirical efforts for incorporating intermediate supervision in sequence-to-sequence language models, our positive theoretical result is the first of its kind in the landscape of results on the benefits of intermediate supervision for neural-network learning: Until now, all theoretical results on the subject are negative, i.e., show cases where learning is impossible without intermediate supervision, while our result is positive, showing that learning is facilitated in the presence of intermediate supervision",

In contrast, we show that the zero duality gap can be obtained by stacking standard deep networks in parallel, which we call a parallel architecture, and modifying the regularization. Therefore, we prove the strong duality and existence of equivalent convex problems that enable globally optimal training of deep networks. As a by-product of our analysis, we demonstrate that the weight decay regularization on the network parameters explicitly encourages low-rank solutions via closed-form expressions.

    "title": "Pessimism in the Face of Confounders: Provably Efficient Offline Reinforcement Learning in Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes",
    "abstract": "We study offline reinforcement learning (RL) in partially observable Markov decision processes. In particular, we aim to learn an optimal policy from a dataset collected by a behavior policy which possibly depends on the latent state. Such a dataset is confounded in the sense that the latent state simultaneously affects the action and the observation, which is prohibitive for existing offline RL algorithms. To this end, we propose the \\underline{P}roxy variable \\underline{P}essimistic \\underline{P}olicy \\underline{O}ptimization (\\texttt{P3O}) algorithm, which addresses the confounding bias and the distributional shift between the optimal and behavior policies in the context of general function approximation. At the core of \\texttt{P3O} is a coupled sequence of pessimistic confidence regions  constructed via proximal causal inference, which is  formulated as  minimax estimation. Under a partial coverage assumption on the confounded dataset, we prove that \\texttt{P3O} achieves a \nn\n−\n1\n/\n2\n-suboptimality, where \nn\n is the number of trajectories in the dataset. To our best knowledge, \\texttt{P3O} is the first provably efficient offline RL algorithm for POMDPs with a confounded dataset",

    "title": "Understanding Zero-shot Adversarial Robustness for Large-Scale Models",
    "abstract": "Pretrained large-scale vision-language models like CLIP have exhibited strong generalization over unseen tasks. Yet imperceptible adversarial perturbations can significantly reduce CLIP's performance on new tasks. In this work, we identify and explore the problem of adapting large-scale models for zero-shot adversarial robustness. We first identify two key factors during model adaption--training losses and adaptation methods--that affect the model's zero-shot adversarial robustness. We then propose a text-guided contrastive adversarial training loss, which aligns the text embeddings and the adversarial visual features with contrastive learning on a small set of training data. We apply this training loss to two adaption methods, model finetuning and visual prompt tuning. We find that visual prompt tuning is more effective in the absence of texts, while finetuning wins in the existence of text guidance. Overall, our approach significantly improves the zero-shot adversarial robustness over CLIP, seeing an average improvement of 31 points over ImageNet and 15 zero-shot datasets. We hope this work can shed light on understanding the zero-shot adversarial robustness of large-scale models",

    "title": "Can We Faithfully Represent Absence States to Compute Shapley Values on a DNN?",
    "abstract": "Masking some input variables of a deep neural network (DNN) and computing output changes on the masked input sample represent a typical way to compute attributions of input variables in the sample. People usually mask an input variable using its baseline value. However, there is no theory to examine whether baseline value faithfully represents the absence of an input variable, i.e., removing all signals from the input variable. Fortunately, recent studies (Ren et al., 2023a; Deng et al., 2022a) show that the inference score of a DNN can be strictly disentangled into a set of causal patterns (or concepts) encoded by the DNN. Therefore, we propose to use causal patterns to examine the faithfulness of baseline values. More crucially, it is proven that causal patterns can be explained as the elementary rationale of the Shapley value. Furthermore, we propose a method to learn optimal baseline values, and experimental results have demonstrated its effectiveness",

    "title": "Dataless Knowledge Fusion by Merging Weights of Language Models",
    "abstract": "Fine-tuning pre-trained language models has become the prevalent paradigm for building downstream NLP models. Oftentimes fine-tuned models are readily available but their training data is not, due to data privacy or intellectual property concerns. This creates a barrier to fusing knowledge across individual models to yield a better single model. In this paper, we study the problem of merging individual models built on different training data sets to obtain a single model that performs well both across all data set domains and can generalize on out-of-domain data. We propose a data-less knowledge fusion method that merges models in their parameter space, guided by weights that minimize prediction differences between the merged model and the individual models. Over a battery of evaluation settings, we show that the proposed method significantly outperforms baselines such as Fisher-weighted averaging or model ensembling. Further, we find that our method is a promising alternative to multi-task learning that can preserve or sometimes improve over the individual models without access to the training data. Finally, model merging is more efficient than training a multi-task model, thus making it applicable to a wider set of scenarios",

    "abstract": "This paper presents Universal Vision-Language Dense Retrieval (UniVL-DR), which builds a unified model for multi-modal retrieval. UniVL-DR encodes queries and multi-modality resources in an embedding space for searching candidates from different modalities. To learn a unified embedding space for multi-modal retrieval, UniVL-DR proposes two techniques: 1) Universal embedding optimization strategy, which contrastively optimizes the embedding space using the modality-balanced hard negatives; 2) Image verbalization method, which bridges the modality gap between images and texts in the raw data space. UniVL-DR achieves the state-of-the-art on the multi-modal open-domain question answering benchmark, WebQA, and outperforms all retrieval models on the two subtasks, text-text retrieval and text-image retrieval. It demonstrates that universal multi-modal search is feasible to replace the divide-and-conquer pipeline with a united model and also benefits single/cross modality tasks.

However, manually identifying and verifying the properties that contribute to accurate optical flow estimation require large-scale trial-and-error experiments with iteratively generating whole synthetic datasets and training on them, \\ie, impractical. To address this challenge, we propose a differentiable optical flow data generation pipeline and a loss function to drive the pipeline, called DFlow. DFlow efficiently synthesizes a dataset effective for a target domain without the need for cumbersome try-and-errors.  This favorable property is achieved by proposing an efficient dataset comparison method that uses neural networks to approximately encode each dataset and compares the proxy networks instead of explicitly comparing datasets in a pairwise way. Our experiments show the competitive performance of our DFlow against the prior arts in pre-training. Furthermore, compared to competing datasets, DFlow achieves the best fine-tuning performance on the Sintel public benchmark with RAFT",

To this end, many \nfair\n clustering approaches have been recently proposed to counteract this issue. Due to the potential for significant harm, it is essential to ensure that fair clustering algorithms provide consistently fair outputs even under adversarial influence. However, fair clustering algorithms have not been studied from an adversarial attack perspective. In contrast to previous research, we seek to bridge this gap and conduct a robustness analysis against fair clustering by proposing a novel \nblack-box fairness attack\n. Through comprehensive experiments, we find that state-of-the-art models are highly susceptible to our attack as it can reduce their fairness performance significantly. Finally, we propose Consensus Fair Clustering (CFC), the first \nrobust fair clustering\n approach that transforms consensus clustering into a fair graph partitioning problem, and iteratively learns to generate fair cluster outputs. Experimentally, we observe that CFC is highly robust to the proposed attack and is thus a truly robust fair clustering alternative",

    "abstract": "Transformers have seen growing interest in processing different modalities,  including language and image data. As a result, we can process vision and language data using transformers that are architecturally similar. Leveraging this feature of transformers, we propose weight sharing across two transformer backbones and within the same transformer backbone and pruning across two backbones in a unified framework. More specifically, we investigate weight sharing and pruning for two components of the transformers: (1) Multi-Head Attention (MSA) and (2) Feed-Forward Network (FFN) layers. To jointly perform weight sharing and pruning, we propose to use a regularization term to align model weights and the desired structure during the multimodal pre-training step. The structure vectors of sharing and pruning are generated by using a hypernetwork, which can capture complex interactions between pruning and sharing across layers and modalities. We train the hypernetwork and model weights iteratively so that the learned structure evolves along with model weights. After minimizing the proposed objective in the pre-training step, we perform weight sharing and pruning and fine-tune the compressed model on downstream tasks. Finally, we perform experiments on vision and language tasks, including Referring Expression Comprehension (REC), Visual Question Answering (VQA), and Object Detection using the state-of-the-art grounding based models: MDETR and GLIP. Our experiments show that we can compress these models by \n35\n−\n40\n%\n by sharing and pruning MSA and FFN weights without almost any loss in accuracy",

    "abstract": "Transfer learning on graphs drawn from varied distributions (domains) is in great demand across many applications. Emerging methods attempt to learn domain-invariant representations using graph neural networks (GNNs), yet the empirical performances vary and the theoretical foundation is limited. This paper aims at designing theory-grounded algorithms for graph domain adaptation (GDA). (i) As the first attempt, we derive a model-based GDA bound closely related to two GNN spectral properties: spectral smoothness (SS) and maximum frequency response (MFR). This is achieved by cross-pollinating between the OT-based (optimal transport) DA and graph filter theories. (ii) Inspired by the theoretical results, we propose algorithms regularizing spectral properties of SS and MFR to improve GNN transferability. We further extend the GDA theory into the more challenging scenario of conditional shift, where spectral regularization still applies. (iii) More importantly, our analyses of the theory reveal which regularization would improve performance of what transfer learning scenario, (iv) with numerical agreement with extensive real-world experiments: SS and MFR regularizations bring more benefits to the scenarios of node transfer and link transfer, respectively. In a nutshell, our study paves the way toward explicitly constructing and training GNNs that can capture more transferable representations across graph domains.

    "abstract": "This work aims to tackle a major challenge in offline Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL), namely the reward extrapolation error, where the learned reward function may fail to explain the task correctly and misguide the agent in unseen environments due to the intrinsic covariate shift. Leveraging both expert data and lower-quality diverse data, we devise a principled algorithm (namely CLARE) that solves offline IRL efficiently via integrating \"conservatism\" into a learned reward function and utilizing an estimated dynamics model. Our theoretical analysis provides an upper bound on the return gap between the learned policy and the expert policy, based on which we characterize the impact of covariate shift by examining subtle two-tier tradeoffs between the exploitation (on both expert and diverse data) and exploration (on the estimated dynamics model). We show that CLARE can provably alleviate the reward extrapolation error by striking the right exploitation-exploration balance therein. Extensive experiments corroborate the significant performance gains of CLARE over existing state-of-the-art algorithms on MuJoCo continuous control tasks (especially with a small offline dataset), and the learned reward is highly instructive for further learning",

    "abstract": "Federated learning (FL) is an emerging distributed learning framework that collaboratively trains a shared model without transferring the local clients' data to a centralized server. Motivated by concerns stemming from extended communication and potential attacks, one-shot FL limits communication to a single round while attempting to retain performance. However, one-shot FL methods often degrade under high statistical heterogeneity, fail to promote pipeline security, or require an auxiliary public dataset. To address these limitations, we propose two novel data-free one-shot FL methods: FedCVAE-Ens and its extension FedCVAE-KD. Both approaches reframe the local learning task using a conditional variational autoencoder (CVAE) to address high statistical heterogeneity. Furthermore, FedCVAE-KD leverages knowledge distillation to compress the ensemble of client decoders into a single decoder. We propose a method that shifts the center of the CVAE prior distribution and experimentally demonstrate that this promotes security, and show how either method can incorporate heterogeneous local models. We confirm the efficacy of the proposed methods over baselines under high statistical heterogeneity using multiple benchmark datasets. In particular, at the highest levels of statistical heterogeneity, both FedCVAE-Ens and FedCVAE-KD typically more than double the accuracy of the baselines",

    "abstract": "Dynamic graphs are ubiquitous across disciplines where observations usually change over time. Regressions on dynamic graphs often contribute to diverse critical tasks, such as climate early-warning and traffic controlling. Existing homophily Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) adopt physical connections or feature similarity as adjacent matrix to perform node-level aggregations. However, on dynamic graphs with diverse node-wise relations, exploiting a pre-defined fixed topology for message passing inevitably leads to the aggregations of target-deviated neighbors. We designate such phenomenon as the topology-task discordance, which naturally challenges the homophily assumption. In this work, we revisit node-wise relationships and explore novel homophily measurements on dynamic graphs with both signs and distances, capturing multiple node-level spatial relations and temporal evolutions. We discover that advancing homophily aggregations to signed target-oriented message passing can effectively resolve the discordance and promote aggregation capacity. Therefore, a GReTo is proposed, which performs signed message passing in immediate neighborhood, and exploits both local environments and target awareness to realize high-order message propagation. Empirically, our solution achieves significant improvements against best baselines, notably improving 24.79% on KnowAir and 3.60% on Metr-LA",

    "abstract": "Dynamic diagnosis is desirable when medical tests are costly or time-consuming. In this work, we use reinforcement learning (RL) to find a dynamic policy that selects lab test panels sequentially based on previous observations, ensuring accurate testing at a low cost. Clinical diagnostic data are often highly imbalanced; therefore, we aim to maximize the F1 score instead of the error rate. However, optimizing the non-concave \nF\n1\n score is not a classic RL problem, thus invalidating standard RL methods. To remedy this issue, we develop a reward shaping approach, leveraging properties of the \nF\n1\n score and duality of policy optimization, to provably find the set of all Pareto-optimal policies for budget-constrained \nF\n1\n score maximization. To handle the combinatorially complex state space, we propose a Semi-Model-based Deep Diagnosis Policy Optimization (SM-DDPO) framework that is compatible with end-to-end training and online learning. SM-DDPO is tested on diverse clinical tasks: ferritin abnormality detection, sepsis mortality prediction, and acute kidney injury diagnosis. Experiments with real-world data validate that SM-DDPO trains efficiently and identify all Pareto-front solutions. Across all tasks, SM-DDPO is able to achieve state-of-the-art diagnosis accuracy (in some cases higher than conventional methods) with up to \n85\n%\n reduction in testing cost.

However, the requirement of RKHS restricts the function class and algorithmic flexibility. This paper offers a general solution to this problem by introducing a functional regularization term that encompasses the RKHS norm as a special case.  This allows us to propose a new particle-based VI algorithm called  preconditioned functional gradient flow (PFG). Compared to SVGD, PFG has several advantages. It has a larger function class, improved scalability in large particle-size scenarios, better adaptation to ill-conditioned distributions, and provable continuous-time convergence in KL divergence.

    "abstract": "Witnessing the impressive achievements of pre-training techniques on large-scale data in the field of computer vision and natural language processing, we wonder whether this idea could be adapted in a grab-and-go spirit, and mitigate the sample inefficiency problem for visuomotor driving. Given the highly dynamic and variant nature of the input, the visuomotor driving task inherently lacks the view and translation invariance, and the visual input contains massive irrelevant information for decision making, resulting in predominant pre-training approaches from general vision less suitable for the autonomous driving task. To this end, we propose PPGeo (Policy Pre-training via Geometric modeling), an intuitive and straightforward fully self-supervised framework curated for the policy pre-training in visuomotor driving. We aim at learning policy representations as a powerful abstraction by modeling 3D geometric scenes on large-scale unlabeled and uncalibrated YouTube driving videos. The proposed PPGeo is performed in two stages to support effective self-supervised training. In the first stage, the geometric modeling framework generates pose and depth predictions simultaneously, with two consecutive frames as input. In the second stage, the visual encoder learns driving policy representation by predicting the future ego-motion and optimizing with the photometric error based on current visual observation only. As such, the pre-trained visual encoder is equipped with rich driving policy related representations and thereby competent for multiple visuomotor driving tasks. As a side product, the pre-trained geometric modeling networks could bring further improvement to the depth and odometry estimation tasks. Extensive experiments covering a wide span of challenging scenarios have demonstrated the superiority of our proposed approach, where improvements range from 2% to even over 100% with very limited data",

We prove that the computational complexity of OAVI is not superlinear, as previously claimed, but linear in the number of samples \nm\n. In addition, we propose two modifications that accelerate OAVI's training time: Our analysis reveals that replacing the pairwise conditional gradients algorithm, one of the solvers used in OAVI, with the faster blended pairwise conditional gradients algorithm leads to an exponential speed-up in the number of features \nn\n. Finally, using a new inverse Hessian boosting approach, intermediate convex optimization problems can be solved almost instantly, improving OAVI's training time by multiple orders of magnitude in a variety of numerical experiments",

    "title": "Switch-NeRF: Learning Scene Decomposition with Mixture of Experts for Large-scale Neural Radiance Fields",
    "abstract": "The Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) have been recently applied to reconstruct building-scale and even city-scale scenes. To model a large-scale scene efficiently, a dominant strategy is to employ a divide-and-conquer paradigm via performing scene decomposition, which decomposes a complex scene into parts that are further processed by different sub-networks. Existing large-scale NeRFs mainly use heuristic hand-crafted scene decomposition, with regular 3D-distance-based or physical-street-block-based schemes. Although achieving promising results, the hand-crafted schemes limit the capabilities of NeRF in large-scale scene modeling in several aspects. Manually designing a universal scene decomposition rule for different complex scenes is challenging, leading to adaptation issues for different scenarios. The decomposition procedure is not learnable, hindering the network from jointly optimizing the scene decomposition and the radiance fields in an end-to-end manner.  The different sub-networks are typically optimized independently, and thus hand-crafted rules are required to composite them to achieve a better consistency.  To tackle these issues, we propose Switch-NeRF, a novel end-to-end large-scale NeRF with learning-based scene decomposition. We design a gating network to dispatch 3D points to different NeRF sub-networks. The gating network can be optimized together with the NeRF sub-networks for different scene partitions, by a design with the Sparsely Gated Mixture of Experts (MoE). The outputs from different sub-networks can also be fused in a learnable way in the unified framework to effectively guarantee the consistency of the whole scene. Furthermore, the proposed MoE-based Switch-NeRF model is carefully implemented and optimized to achieve both high-fidelity scene reconstruction and efficient computation. Our method establishes clear state-of-the-art performances on several large-scale datasets. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to propose an applicable end-to-end sparse NeRF network  with learning-based decomposition for large-scale scenes.

    "title": "NORM: Knowledge Distillation via N-to-One Representation Matching",
    "abstract": "Existing feature distillation methods commonly adopt the One-to-one Representation Matching between any pre-selected teacher-student layer pair. In this paper, we present \nN\n-to-\nO\nne \nR\nepresentation \nM\natching (NORM), a new two-stage knowledge distillation method, which relies on a simpleFeature Transform (FT) module consisting of two linear layers. In view of preserving the intact information learnt by the teacher network, during training, our FT module is merely inserted after the last convolutional layer of the student network. The first linear layer projects the student representation to a feature space having \nN\n times feature channels than the teacher representation from the last convolutional layer, and the second linear layer contracts the expanded output back to the original feature space. By sequentially splitting the expanded student representation into \nN\n non-overlapping feature segments having the same number of feature channels as the teacher's, they can be readily forced to approximate the intact teacher representation simultaneously, formulating a novel many-to-one representation matching mechanism conditioned on a single teacher-student layer pair. After training, such an FT module will be naturally merged into the subsequent fully connected layer thanks to its linear property, introducing no extra parameters or architectural modifications to the student network at inference. Extensive experiments on different visual recognition benchmarks demonstrate the leading performance of our method. For instance, the ResNet18|MobileNet|ResNet50-1/4 model trained by NORM reaches 72.14%|74.26%|68.03% top-1 accuracy on the ImageNet dataset when using a pre-trained ResNet34|ResNet50|ResNet50 model as the teacher, achieving an absolute improvement of 2.01%|4.63%|3.03% against the individually trained counterpart.

    "abstract": "We introduce CriticSMC, a new algorithm for planning as inference built from a composition of sequential Monte Carlo with learned Soft-Q function heuristic factors. These heuristic factors, obtained from parametric approximations of the marginal likelihood ahead, more effectively guide SMC towards the desired target distribution, which is particularly helpful for planning in environments with hard constraints placed sparsely in time. Compared with previous work, we modify the placement of such heuristic factors, which allows us to cheaply propose and evaluate large numbers of putative action particles, greatly increasing inference and planning efficiency. CriticSMC is compatible with informative priors, whose density function need not be known, and can be used as a model-free control algorithm. Our experiments on collision avoidance in a high-dimensional simulated driving task show that CriticSMC significantly reduces collision rates at a low computational cost while maintaining realism and diversity of driving behaviors across vehicles and environment scenarios",

    "abstract": "The success of deep learning heavily relies on large-scale data with comprehensive labels, which is more expensive and time-consuming to fetch in 3D compared to 2D images or natural languages. This promotes the potential of utilizing models pretrained with data more than 3D as teachers for cross-modal knowledge transferring. In this paper, we revisit masked modeling in a unified fashion of knowledge distillation, and we show that foundational Transformers pretrained with 2D images or natural languages can help self-supervised 3D representation learning through training Autoencoders as Cross-Modal Teachers (ACT). The pretrained Transformers are transferred as cross-modal 3D teachers using discrete variational autoencoding self-supervision, during which the Transformers are frozen with prompt tuning for better knowledge inheritance. The latent features encoded by the 3D teachers are used as the target of masked point modeling, wherein the dark knowledge is distilled to the 3D Transformer students as foundational geometry understanding. Our ACT pretrained 3D learner achieves state-of-the-art generalization capacity across various downstream benchmarks, e.g., 88.21% overall accuracy on ScanObjectNN.

    "abstract": "We study the theory of neural network (NN) from the lens of classical nonparametric regression problems with a focus on NN’s ability to adaptively estimate functions with heterogeneous smoothness — a property of functions in Besov or Bounded Variation (BV) classes. Existing work on this problem requires tuning the NN architecture based on the function spaces and sample sizes. We consider a “Parallel NN” variant of deep ReLU networks and show that the standard weight decay is equivalent to promoting the ℓp -sparsity (0 < p < 1) of the coefficient vector of an end-to-end learned function bases, i.e., a dictionary. Using this equivalence, we further establish that by tuning only the weight decay, such Parallel NN achieves an estimation error arbitrarily close to the minimax rates for both the Besov and BV classes. Notably, it gets exponentially closer to minimax optimal as the NN gets deeper. Our research sheds new lights on why depth matters and how NNs are more powerful than kernel methods",

    "title": "Sparse Token Transformer with Attention Back Tracking",
    "abstract": "Despite the success of Transformers in various applications from text, vision, and speech domains, they are yet to become standard architectures for mobile and edge device applications due to their heavy memory and computational requirements. While there exist many different approaches to reduce the complexities of the Transformers, such as the pruning of the weights/attentions/tokens, quantization, and distillation, we focus on token pruning, which reduces not only the complexity of the attention operations, but also the linear layers, which have non-negligible computational costs. However, previous token pruning approaches often remove tokens during the feed-forward stage without consideration of their impact on later layers' attentions, which has a potential risk of dropping out important tokens for the given task. To tackle this issue, we propose an attention back-tracking method that tracks the importance of each attention in a Transformer architecture from the outputs to the inputs, to preserve the tokens that have a large impact on the final predictions. We experimentally validate the effectiveness of the method on both NLP and CV benchmarks, using Transformer architectures for both domains, and the results show that the proposed attention back-tracking allows the model to better retain the full models' performance even at high sparsity rates, significantly outperforming all baselines. Qualitative analysis of the examples further shows that our method does preserve semantically meaningful tokens",

    "title": "Robust Active Distillation",
    "abstract": "Distilling knowledge from a large teacher model to a lightweight one is a widely successful approach for generating compact, powerful models in the semi-supervised learning setting where a limited amount of labeled data is available. In large-scale applications, however, the teacher tends to provide a large number of incorrect soft-labels that impairs student performance. The sheer size of the teacher additionally constrains the number of soft-labels that can be queried due to prohibitive computational and/or financial costs. The difficulty in achieving simultaneous \\emph{efficiency} (i.e., minimizing soft-label queries) and \\emph{robustness} (i.e., avoiding student inaccuracies due to incorrect labels) hurts the widespread application of knowledge distillation to many modern tasks. In this paper, we present a parameter-free approach with provable guarantees to query the soft-labels of points that are simultaneously informative and correctly labeled by the teacher. At the core of our work lies a game-theoretic formulation that explicitly considers the inherent trade-off between the informativeness and correctness of input instances. We establish bounds on the expected performance of our approach that hold even in worst-case distillation instances. We present empirical evaluations on popular benchmarks that demonstrate the improved distillation performance enabled by our work relative to that of state-of-the-art active learning and active distillation methods",

However, the computational cost and memory requirement render these methods unsuitable on the mobile device, especially for the high resolution per-pixel semantic segmentation task. In this paper, we introduce a new method squeeze-enhanced Axial Transformer (SeaFormer) for mobile semantic segmentation. Specifically, we design a generic attention block characterized by the formulation of squeeze Axial and spatial enhancement. It can be further used to create a family of backbone architectures with superior cost-effectiveness. Coupled with a light segmentation head, we demonstrate state-of-the-art results on the ADE20K, Pascal Context and COCO-stuff datasets. Critically, we beat both the mobile-friendly rivals and Transformer-based counterparts with better performance and lower latency without bells and whistles.

    "abstract": "Due to the significant computational challenge of training large-scale graph neural networks (GNNs), various sparse learning techniques have been exploited to reduce memory and storage costs. Examples include graph sparsification that samples a subgraph to reduce the amount of data aggregation and model sparsification that prunes the neural network to reduce the number of trainable weights. Despite the empirical successes in reducing the training cost while maintaining the test accuracy, the theoretical generalization analysis of sparse learning for GNNs remains elusive. To the best of our knowledge, this paper provides the first theoretical characterization of joint edge-model sparse learning from the perspective of sample complexity and convergence rate in achieving zero generalization error. It proves analytically that both sampling important nodes and pruning neurons with lowest-magnitude can reduce the sample complexity and improve convergence without compromising the test accuracy. Although the analysis is centered on two-layer GNNs with structural constraints on data, the insights are applicable to more general setups and justified by both synthetic and practical citation datasets",

Further, we interpret our overall minimization approach as a recurrent network that we then employ to deal with inverse low-level computer vision problems. Thanks to the convergence guarantees that our IRLS strategy offers, we are able to train the derived reconstruction networks using a memory-efficient implicit back-propagation scheme, which does not pose any restrictions on their effective depth. To assess our networks' performance, we compare them against other existing reconstruction methods on several inverse problems, namely image deblurring, super-resolution, demosaicking and sparse recovery. Our reconstruction results are shown to be very competitive and in many cases outperform those of existing unrolled networks, whose number of parameters is orders of magnitude higher than that of our learned models",

Their benefits, however, remain an open question on Adam-based large model pre-training (e.g. BERT and GPT).

To alleviate this limitation, we propose \\textbf{0/1 Adam} that linearizes each Adam step via approximating its optimizer states using their stale estimates and linear correlation. \\textbf{0/1 Adam} performs an Adam-like step to preserve the adaptivity, while its linearity allows utilizing 1-bit compression and local steps simultaneously for wall-clock time speed up. We provide convergence guarantee for \\textbf{0/1 Adam} on smooth non-convex objectives.

Using a graph for learning introduces inter-user dependencies in prediction; our key point is that strategic users can exploit these to promote their goals.

    "abstract": "The ability to discover behaviours from past experience and transfer them to new tasks is a hallmark of intelligent agents acting sample-efficiently in the real world. Equipping embodied reinforcement learners with the same ability may be crucial for their successful deployment in robotics. While hierarchical and KL-regularized reinforcement learning individually hold promise here, arguably a hybrid approach could combine their respective benefits. Key to these fields is the use of information asymmetry across architectural modules to bias which skills are learnt. While asymmetry choice has a large influence on transferability, existing methods base their choice primarily on intuition in a domain-independent, potentially sub-optimal, manner. In this paper, we theoretically and empirically show the crucial expressivity-transferability trade-off of skills across sequential tasks, controlled by information asymmetry. Given this insight, we introduce Attentive Priors for Expressive and Transferable Skills (APES), a hierarchical KL-regularized method, heavily benefiting from both priors and hierarchy. Unlike existing approaches, APES automates the choice of asymmetry by learning it in a data-driven, domain-dependent, way based on our expressivity-transferability theorems. Experiments over complex transfer domains of varying levels of extrapolation and sparsity, such as robot block stacking, demonstrate the criticality of the correct asymmetric choice, with APES drastically outperforming previous methods",

In this paper, we propose an Efficient single-model Variable-bit-rate Codec (EVC), which is able to run at 30 FPS with 768x512 input images and still outperforms VVC for the RD performance. By further reducing both encoder and decoder complexities, our small model even achieves 30 FPS with 1920x1080 input images. To bridge the performance gap between our different capacities models, we meticulously design the mask decay, which transforms the large model's parameters into the small model automatically. And a novel sparsity regularization loss is proposed to mitigate shortcomings of \nL\np\n regularization. Our algorithm significantly narrows the performance gap by 50% and 30% for our medium and small models, respectively. At last, we advocate the scalable encoder for neural image compression. The encoding complexity is dynamic to meet different latency requirements. We propose decaying the large encoder multiple times to reduce the residual representation progressively.

Meanwhile, reinforcement learning (RL) is widely regarded as a promising framework for optimizing long-term engagement in sequential recommendation. However, due to expensive online interactions, it is very difficult for RL algorithms to perform state-action value estimation, exploration and feature extraction when optimizing long-term engagement. In this paper, we propose ResAct which seeks a policy that is close to, but better than, the online-serving policy. In this way, we can collect sufficient data near the learned policy so that state-action values can be properly estimated, and there is no need to perform online exploration. ResAct optimizes the policy by first reconstructing the online behaviors and then improving it via a Residual Actor. To extract long-term information, ResAct utilizes two information-theoretical regularizers to confirm the expressiveness and conciseness of features. We conduct experiments on a benchmark dataset and a large-scale industrial dataset which consists of tens of millions of recommendation requests.

    "abstract": "The great success of deep learning heavily relies on increasingly larger training data, which comes at a price of huge computational and infrastructural costs. This poses crucial questions that, do all training data contribute to model's performance? How much does each individual training sample or a sub-training-set affect the model's generalization, and how to construct the smallest subset from the entire training data as a proxy training set without significantly sacrificing the model's performance? To answer these, we propose dataset pruning, an optimization-based sample selection method that can (1) examine the influence of removing a particular set of training samples on model's generalization ability with theoretical guarantee, and (2) construct the smallest subset of training data that yields strictly constrained generalization gap. The empirically observed generalization gap of dataset pruning is substantially consistent with our theoretical expectations. Furthermore, the proposed method prunes 40% training examples on the CIFAR-10 dataset, halves the convergence time with only 1.3% test accuracy decrease, which is superior to previous score-based sample selection methods",

    "title": "StrucTexTv2: Masked Visual-Textual Prediction for Document Image Pre-training",
    "abstract": "In this paper, we present StrucTexTv2, an effective document image pre-training framework, by performing masked visual-textual prediction. It consists of two self-supervised pre-training tasks: masked image modeling and masked language modeling, based on text region-level image masking. The proposed method randomly masks some image regions according to the bounding box coordinates of text words. The objectives of our pre-training tasks are reconstructing the pixels of masked image regions and the corresponding masked tokens simultaneously. Hence the pre-trained encoder can capture more textual semantics in comparison to the masked image modeling that usually predicts the masked image patches. Compared to the masked multi-modal modeling methods for document image understanding that rely on both the image and text modalities, StrucTexTv2 models image-only input and potentially deals with more application scenarios free from OCR pre-processing. Extensive experiments on mainstream benchmarks of document image understanding demonstrate the effectiveness of StrucTexTv2. It achieves competitive or even new state-of-the-art performance in various downstream tasks such as image classification, layout analysis, table structure recognition, document OCR, and information extraction under the end-to-end scenario",

    "title": "General Neural Gauge Fields",
    "abstract": "The recent advance of neural fields, such as neural radiance fields, has significantly pushed the boundary of scene representation learning. Aiming to boost the computation efﬁciency and rendering quality of 3D scenes, a popular line of research maps the 3D coordinate system to another measuring system, e.g., 2D manifolds and hash tables, for modeling neural fields. The conversion of coordinate systems can be typically dubbed as \\emph{gauge transformation}, which is usually a pre-defined mapping function, e.g., orthogonal projection or spatial hash function. This begs a question: can we directly learn a desired gauge transformation along with the neural field in an end-to-end manner? In this work, we extend this problem to a general paradigm with a taxonomy of discrete and continuous cases, and develop an end-to-end learning framework to jointly optimize the gauge transformation and neural fields. To counter the problem that the learning of gauge transformations can collapse easily, we derive a general regularization mechanism from the principle of information conservation during the gauge transformation. To circumvent the high computation cost in gauge learning with regularization, we directly derive an information-invariant gauge transformation which allows to preserve scene information inherently and yield superior performance",

    "title": "Understanding Why Generalized Reweighting Does Not Improve Over ERM",
    "abstract": "Empirical risk minimization (ERM) is known to be non-robust in practice to distributional shift where the training and the test distributions are different. A suite of approaches, such as importance weighting, and variants of distributionally robust optimization (DRO), have been proposed to solve this problem. But a line of recent work has empirically shown that these approaches do not significantly improve over ERM in real applications with distribution shift. The goal of this work is to obtain a comprehensive theoretical understanding of this intriguing phenomenon. We first posit the class of Generalized Reweighting (GRW) algorithms, as a broad category of approaches that iteratively update model parameters based on iterative reweighting of the training samples. We show that when overparameterized models are trained under GRW, the resulting models are close to that obtained by ERM. We also show that adding small regularization which does not greatly affect the empirical training accuracy does not help. Together, our results show that a broad category of what we term GRW approaches are not able to achieve distributionally robust generalization. Our work thus has the following sobering takeaway: to make progress towards distributionally robust generalization, we either have to develop non-GRW approaches, or perhaps devise novel classification/regression loss functions that are adapted to GRW approaches",

    "title": "Gradient-Guided Importance Sampling for Learning Binary Energy-Based Models",
    "abstract": "Learning energy-based models (EBMs) is known to be difficult especially on discrete data where gradient-based learning strategies cannot be applied directly. Although ratio matching is a sound method to learn discrete EBMs, it suffers from expensive computation and excessive memory requirements, thereby resulting in difficulties in learning EBMs on high-dimensional data. Motivated by these limitations, in this study, we propose ratio matching with gradient-guided importance sampling (RMwGGIS). Particularly, we use the gradient of the energy function w.r.t. the discrete data space to approximately construct the provably optimal proposal distribution, which is subsequently used by importance sampling to efficiently estimate the original ratio matching objective. We perform experiments on density modeling over synthetic discrete data, graph generation, and training Ising models to evaluate our proposed method. The experimental results demonstrate that our method can significantly alleviate the limitations of ratio matching, perform more effectively in practice, and scale to high-dimensional problems.

    "title": "Reliability of CKA as a Similarity Measure in Deep Learning",
    "abstract": "Comparing learned neural representations in neural networks is a challenging but important problem, which has been approached in different ways. The Centered Kernel Alignment (CKA) similarity metric, particularly its linear variant, has recently become a popular approach and has been widely used to compare representations of a network's different layers, of architecturally similar networks trained differently, or of models with different architectures trained on the same data. A wide variety of claims about similarity and dissimilarity of these various representations have been made using CKA results. In this work we present analysis that formally characterizes CKA sensitivity to a large class of simple transformations, which can naturally occur in the context of modern machine learning. This provides a concrete explanation to CKA sensitivity to outliers, which has been observed in past works, and to transformations that preserve the linear separability of the data, an important generalization attribute. We empirically investigate several weaknesses of the CKA similarity metric, demonstrating situations in which it gives unexpected or counterintuitive results. Finally we study approaches for modifying representations to maintain functional behaviour while changing the CKA value. Our results illustrate that, in many cases, the CKA value can be easily manipulated without substantial changes to the functional behaviour of the models, and call for caution when leveraging activation alignment metrics",

    "title": "Fair Attribute Completion on Graph with Missing Attributes",
    "abstract": "Tackling unfairness in graph learning models is a challenging task, as the unfairness issues on graphs involve both attributes and topological structures. Existing work on fair graph learning simply assumes that attributes of all nodes are available for model training and then makes fair predictions. In practice, however, the attributes of some nodes might not be accessible due to missing data or privacy concerns, which makes fair graph learning even more challenging. In this paper, we propose FairAC, a fair attribute completion method, to complement missing information and learn fair node embeddings for graphs with missing attributes. FairAC adopts an attention mechanism to deal with the attribute missing problem and meanwhile, it mitigates two types of unfairness, i.e., feature unfairness from attributes and topological unfairness due to attribute completion. FairAC can work on various types of homogeneous graphs and generate fair embeddings for them and thus can be applied to most downstream tasks to improve their fairness performance. To our best knowledge, FairAC is the first method that jointly addresses the graph attribution completion and graph unfairness problems. Experimental results on benchmark datasets show that our method achieves better fairness performance with less sacrifice in accuracy, compared with the state-of-the-art methods of fair graph learning.

    "title": "ERL-Re$^2$: Efficient Evolutionary Reinforcement Learning with Shared State Representation and Individual Policy Representation",
    "abstract": "Deep Reinforcement Learning (Deep RL) and Evolutionary Algorithm (EA) are two major paradigms of policy optimization with distinct learning principles, i.e., gradient-based v.s. gradient-free. An appealing research direction is integrating Deep RL and EA to devise new methods by fusing their complementary advantages. However, existing works on combining Deep RL and EA have two common drawbacks:1) the RL agent and EA agents learn their policies individually, neglecting efficient sharing of useful common knowledge; 2) parameter-level policy optimization guarantees no semantic level of behavior evolution for the EA side. In this paper, we propose Evolutionary Reinforcement Learning with Two-scale State Representation and Policy Representation (ERL-Re\n2\n), a novel solution to the aforementioned two drawbacks. The key idea of ERL-Re\n2\n is two-scale representation: all EA and RL policies share the same nonlinear state representation while maintaining individual linear policy representations. The state representation conveys expressive common features of the environment learned by all the agents collectively; the linear policy representation provides a favorable space for efficient policy optimization, where novel behavior-level crossover and mutation operations can be performed. Moreover, the linear policy representation allows convenient generalization of policy fitness with the help of Policy-extended Value Function Approximator (PeVFA), further improving the sample efficiency of fitness estimation. The experiments on a range of continuous control tasks show that ERL-Re\n2\n consistently outperforms advanced baselines and achieves the State Of The Art (SOTA).

    "abstract": "Chain-of-thought prompting has demonstrated remarkable performance on various natural language reasoning tasks. However, it tends to perform poorly on tasks which requires solving problems harder than the exemplars shown in the prompts. To overcome this challenge of easy-to-hard generalization, we propose a novel prompting strategy, least-to-most prompting. The key idea in this strategy is to break down a complex problem into a series of simpler subproblems and then solve them in sequence. Solving each subproblem is facilitated by the answers to previously solved subproblems. Our experimental results on tasks related to symbolic manipulation, compositional generalization, and math reasoning reveal that least-to-most prompting is capable of generalizing to more difficult problems than those seen in the prompts. A notable finding is that when the GPT-3 code-davinci-002 model is used with least-to-most prompting, it can solve the compositional generalization benchmark SCAN in any split (including length split)  with an accuracy of at least 99\\% using just 14 exemplars, compared to only 16\\% accuracy with chain-of-thought prompting.  This is particularly noteworthy because neural-symbolic models in the literature that specialize in solving SCAN are trained on the entire training set containing over 15,000 examples.

    "abstract": "For unsupervised pretraining, mask-reconstruction pretraining (MRP) approaches, e.g. MAE and data2vec, randomly mask input patches and then reconstruct the pixels or semantic features of these masked patches via an auto-encoder. Then for a downstream task, supervised fine-tuning the pretrained encoder remarkably surpasses the conventional \"supervised learning\" (SL) trained from scratch. However, it is still unclear 1) how MRP performs semantic (feature) learning in the pretraining phase and 2) why it helps in downstream tasks.  To solve these problems, we first theoretically show that on an auto-encoder of a two/one-layered convolution encoder/decoder, MRP can capture all discriminative semantics of each potential semantic class in the pretraining dataset. Then considering the fact that the pretraining dataset is of huge size and high diversity and thus covers most semantics in downstream dataset, in fine-tuning phase, the pretrained encoder can capture as much semantics as it can in downstream datasets, and would not lost these semantics with theoretical guarantees.  In contrast, SL only randomly captures some semantics due to lottery ticket hypothesis. So  MRP provably achieves better performance than SL  on the classification tasks.   Experimental results testify to our data assumptions and also our theoretical implications",

Specifically, we first introduce the concept of part-level SE(3) equivariance and devise a network to learn features of such property. Then, through a carefully designed fine-grained pose-shape disentanglement strategy, we expect that canonical spaces to support pose estimation could be induced automatically. Thus, we could further predict articulated object poses as per-part rigid transformations describing how parts transform from their canonical part spaces to the camera space. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on both complete and partial point clouds from synthetic and real articulated object datasets",

In contrast, traditional neural networks suffer from forgetting in changing environments and many methods have been proposed to limit forgetting with different trade-offs. Inspired by the brain thalamocortical circuit, we introduce a simple algorithm that uses optimization at inference time to generate internal representations of the current task dynamically. The algorithm alternates between updating the model weights and a latent task embedding, allowing the agent to parse the stream of temporal experience into discrete events and organize learning about them. On a continual learning benchmark, it achieves competitive end average accuracy by mitigating forgetting, but importantly, the interaction between the weights dynamics and the latent dynamics organizes knowledge into flexible structures with a cognitive interface to control them. Tasks later in the sequence can be solved through knowledge transfer as they become reachable within the well-factorized latent space. The algorithm meets many of the desiderata of an ideal continually learning agent in open-ended environments, and its simplicity suggests fundamental computations in circuits with abundant feedback control loops such as the thalamocortical circuits in the brain",

Methods based on IPs usually carry out function-space approximate inference, which overcomes some of the difficulties of parameter-space approximate inference. Nevertheless, the approximations employed often limit the expressiveness of the final model, resulting, e.g., in a Gaussian predictive distribution, which can be restrictive. We propose here a multi-layer generalization of IPs called the Deep Variational Implicit process (DVIP). This generalization is similar to that of deep GPs over GPs, but it is more flexible due to the use of IPs as the prior distribution over the latent functions. We describe a scalable variational inference algorithm for training DVIP and show that it outperforms previous IP-based methods and also deep GPs. We support these claims via extensive regression and classification experiments.

However, in practice, the treatment assignment is usually confounded by unobserved variables and thus introduces bias. A remedy to remove the bias is the use of instrumental variables (IVs). Such settings are widespread in medicine (e.g., trials where the treatment assignment is used as binary IV). In this paper, we propose a novel, multiply robust machine learning framework, called MRIV, for estimating CATEs using binary IVs and thus yield an unbiased CATE estimator. Different from previous work for binary IVs, our framework estimates the CATE directly via a pseudo-outcome regression. (1)~We provide a theoretical analysis where we show that our framework yields multiple robust convergence rates: our CATE estimator achieves fast convergence even if several nuisance estimators converge slowly. (2)~We further show that our framework asymptotically outperforms state-of-the-art plug-in IV methods for CATE estimation, in the sense that it achieves a faster rate of convergence if the CATE is smoother than the individual outcome surfaces. (3)~We build upon our theoretical results and propose a tailored deep neural network architecture called MRIV-Net for CATE estimation using binary IVs. Across various computational experiments, we demonstrate empirically that our MRIV-Net achieves state-of-the-art performance.

    "abstract": "Interpretable machine learning offers insights into what factors drive a certain prediction of a black-box system. A large number of interpreting methods focus on identifying explanatory input features, which generally fall into two main categories: attribution and selection. A popular attribution-based approach is to exploit local neighborhoods for learning instance-specific explainers in an additive manner. The process is thus inefficient and susceptible to poorly-conditioned samples. Meanwhile, many selection-based methods directly optimize local feature distributions in an instance-wise training framework, thereby being capable of leveraging global information from other inputs. However, they can only interpret single-class predictions and many suffer from inconsistency across different settings, due to a strict reliance on a pre-defined number of features selected. This work exploits the strengths of both methods and proposes a framework for learning local explanations simultaneously for multiple target classes. Our model explainer significantly outperforms additive and instance-wise counterparts on faithfulness with more compact and comprehensible explanations.

This demands collaboration among cameras and enforces the epipolar geometric constraint between different views, which makes it challenging to deploy these methods in distributed camera systems with randomly overlapping fields of view. Meanwhile, distributed source coding theory indicates that efficient data compression of correlated sources can be achieved by independent encoding and joint decoding, which motivates us to design a learning-based distributed multi-view image coding (LDMIC) framework. With independent encoders, LDMIC introduces a simple yet effective joint context transfer module based on the cross-attention mechanism at the decoder to effectively capture the global inter-view correlations, which is insensitive to the geometric relationships between images.

    "abstract": "Randomized smoothing is sound when using infinite precision. However, we show that randomized smoothing is no longer sound for limited floating-point precision. We present a simple example where randomized smoothing certifies a radius of \n1.26\n around a point, even though there is an adversarial example in the distance \n0.8\n and show how this can be abused to give false certificates for CIFAR10. We discuss the implicit assumptions of randomized smoothing and show that they do not apply to generic image classification models whose smoothed versions are commonly  certified.  In order to overcome this problem, we propose a sound approach to randomized smoothing when using floating-point precision with essentially  equal speed for quantized input. It yields sound certificates or image classifiers which for the ones tested so far are very similar to the unsound practice of randomized smoothing.  Our only assumption is that we have  access to a fair coin",

    "title": "Provably Efficient Risk-Sensitive Reinforcement Learning: Iterated CVaR and Worst Path",
    "abstract": "In this paper, we study a novel episodic risk-sensitive Reinforcement Learning (RL) problem, named Iterated CVaR RL, which aims to maximize the tail of the reward-to-go at each step, and focuses on tightly controlling the risk of getting into catastrophic situations at each stage. This formulation is applicable to real-world tasks that demand strong risk avoidance throughout the decision process, such as autonomous driving, clinical treatment planning and robotics. We investigate two performance metrics under Iterated CVaR RL, i.e., Regret Minimization  and Best Policy Identification. For both metrics, we design efficient algorithms ICVaR-RM and ICVaR-BPI, respectively, and provide nearly matching upper and lower bounds with respect to the number of episodes \nK\n. We also investigate an interesting limiting case of Iterated CVaR RL, called Worst Path RL, where the objective becomes to maximize the minimum possible cumulative reward. For Worst Path RL, we propose an efficient algorithm with constant upper and lower bounds. Finally, the techniques we develop for bounding the change of CVaR due to the value function shift and decomposing the regret via a distorted visitation distribution are novel, and can find applications in other risk-sensitive online learning problems",

    "title": "Test-Time Robust Personalization for Federated Learning",
    "abstract": "Federated Learning (FL) is a machine learning paradigm where many clients collaboratively learn a shared global model with decentralized training data. Personalization on FL models additionally adapts the global model to different clients, achieving promising results on consistent local training & test distributions. However, for real-world personalized FL applications, it is crucial to go one step further: robustifying FL models under the evolving local test set during deployment, where various types of distribution shifts can arise. In this work, we identify the pitfalls of existing works under test-time distribution shifts and propose Federated Test-time Head Ensemble plus tuning (FedTHE+), which personalizes FL models with robustness to various test-time distribution shifts. We illustrate the advancement of FedTHE+ (and its degraded computationally efficient variant FedTHE) over strong competitors, for training various neural architectures (CNN, ResNet, and Transformer) on CIFAR10 and ImageNet and evaluating on diverse test distributions. Along with this, we build a benchmark for assessing the performance and robustness of personalized FL methods during deployment. Code: \\url{https://github.com/LINs-lab/FedTHE}",

Based on this sensitivity, we then present SENet, a three-stage training method that for a given ReLU budget, automatically assigns per-layer ReLU counts, decides the ReLU locations for each layer’s activation map, and trains a model with significantly fewer ReLUs to potentially yield latency and communication efficient PI. Experimental evaluations with multiple models on various datasets show SENet’s superior performance both in terms of reduced ReLUs and improved classification accuracy compared to existing alternatives. In particular, SENet can yield models that require up to ∼2× fewer ReLUs while yielding similar accuracy.

    "title": "Meta Knowledge Condensation for Federated Learning",
    "abstract": "Existing federated learning paradigms usually extensively exchange distributed models, rather than original data, at a central solver to achieve a more powerful model. However, this would incur severe communication burden between a server and multiple clients especially when data distributions are heterogeneous. As a result, current federated learning methods often require plenty of communication rounds in training. Unlike existing paradigms, we introduce an alternative perspective to significantly decrease the federate learning communication cost without leaking original data. In this work, we first present a meta knowledge representation method that extracts meta knowledge from distributed clients.  The extracted meta knowledge encodes essential information that can be used to improve the current model. As the training progresses, the contributions of the same training samples to a federated model should also vary. Thus, we introduce a dynamic weight assignment mechanism that enables informative samples to contribute adaptively to the current model update. Then, informative meta knowledge from all active clients is sent to the server for model update. Training model on the combined meta knowledge that is regarded as a condense form of original data can significantly mitigate the heterogeneity issues. Moreover, to further ameliorate data heterogeneity, we also exchange meta knowledge among clients as conditional initialisation for meta knowledge extraction. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed method. Remarkably, our method outperforms the state-of-the-art by a large margin (from \n74.07\n%\n to \n92.95\n%\n) on MNIST with a restricted communication budget (\\textit{i.e.}, 10 rounds)",

    "title": "Masked Frequency Modeling for Self-Supervised Visual Pre-Training",
    "abstract": "We present Masked Frequency Modeling (MFM), a unified frequency-domain-based approach for self-supervised pre-training of visual models. Instead of randomly inserting mask tokens to the input embeddings in the spatial domain, in this paper, we shift the perspective to the frequency domain. Specifically, MFM first masks out a portion of frequency components of the input image and then predicts the missing frequencies on the frequency spectrum. Our key insight is that predicting masked components in the frequency domain is more ideal to reveal underlying image patterns rather than predicting masked patches in the spatial domain, due to the heavy spatial redundancy. Our findings suggest that with the right configuration of mask-and-predict strategy, both the structural information within high-frequency components and the low-level statistics among low-frequency counterparts are useful in learning good representations. For the first time, MFM demonstrates that, for both ViT and CNN, a simple non-Siamese framework can learn meaningful representations even using none of the following: (i) extra data, (ii) extra model, (iii) mask token. Experimental results on image classification and semantic segmentation, as well as several robustness benchmarks show the competitive performance and advanced robustness of MFM compared with recent masked image modeling approaches. Furthermore, we also comprehensively investigate the effectiveness of classical image restoration tasks for representation learning from a unified frequency perspective and reveal their intriguing relations with our MFM approach.

    "title": "Dynamic Prompt Learning via Policy Gradient for Semi-structured Mathematical Reasoning",
    "abstract": "Mathematical reasoning, a core ability of human intelligence, presents unique challenges for machines in abstract thinking and logical reasoning. Recent large pre-trained language models such as GPT-3 have achieved remarkable progress on mathematical reasoning tasks written in text form, such as math word problems (MWP). However, it is unknown if the models can handle more complex problems that involve math reasoning over heterogeneous information, such as tabular data. To fill the gap, we present Tabular Math Word Problems (TabMWP), a new dataset containing 38,431 open-domain grade-level problems that require mathematical reasoning on both textual and tabular data. Each question in TabMWP is aligned with a tabular context, which is presented as an image, semi-structured text, and a structured table. There are two types of questions: free-text and multi-choice, and each problem is annotated with gold solutions to reveal the multi-step reasoning process. We evaluate different pre-trained models on TabMWP, including the GPT-3 model in a few-shot setting. As earlier studies suggest, since few-shot GPT-3 relies on the selection of in-context examples, its performance is unstable and can degrade to near chance. The unstable issue is more severe when handling complex problems like TabMWP. To mitigate this, we further propose a novel approach, PromptPG, which utilizes policy gradient to learn to select in-context examples from a small amount of training data and then constructs the corresponding prompt for the test example. Experimental results show that our method outperforms the best baseline by 5.31% on the accuracy metric and reduces the prediction variance significantly compared to random selection, which verifies its effectiveness in selecting in-context examples.

Emergent Languages are artificial communication protocols arising among agents. However, it is not obvious whether such a simulated language would have the same properties as natural language. In this paper, we test if they satisfy HAS. HAS states that word boundaries can be obtained solely from phonemes in natural language. We adopt HAS-based word segmentation and verify whether emergent languages have meaningful word segments. The experiment suggested they do not have, although they meet some preconditions for HAS.

    "abstract": "Video representation learning has been successful in video-text pre-training for zero-shot transfer, where each sentence is trained to be close to the paired video clips in a common feature space. For long videos, given a paragraph of description where the sentences describe different segments of the video, by matching all sentence-clip pairs,  the paragraph and the full video are aligned implicitly. However, such unit-level similarity measure may ignore the global temporal context over a long time span, which inevitably limits the generalization ability. In this paper, we propose a contrastive learning framework TempCLR to compare the full video and the paragraph explicitly. As the video/paragraph is formulated as a sequence of clips/sentences, under the constraint of their temporal order, we use dynamic time warping to compute the minimum cumulative cost over sentence-clip pairs as the sequence-level distance. To explore the temporal dynamics, we break the consistency of temporal order by shuffling the video clips or sentences according to the temporal granularity. In this way, we obtain the representations for clips/sentences, which perceive the temporal information and thus facilitate the sequence alignment. In addition to pre-training on the video and paragraph, our approach can also generalize on the matching between different video instances. We evaluate our approach on video retrieval, action step localization, and few-shot action recognition, and achieve consistent performance gain over all three tasks. Detailed ablation studies are provided to justify the approach design",

We perform reconstruction and backtracking on the model representations optimized by Bort and observe a clear improvement in model explainability. Based on Bort, we are able to synthesize explainable adversarial samples without additional parameters and training.

We propose a series of new algorithms based on regularizing the payoff functions of the game, and establish a set of convergence results that strictly improve over the existing ones, with either weaker assumptions or stronger convergence guarantees. In particular, we first show that dilated optimistic mirror descent (DOMD),  an efficient variant of OMD for solving EFGs, with adaptive regularization can achieve a fast \nO\n~\n(\n1\n/\nT\n)\n  last-iterate convergence in terms of duality gap and distance to the set of Nash equilibrium (NE) without uniqueness assumption of the NE.

To  the best of our knowledge, they constitute the first last-iterate convergence results  for CFR-type  algorithms, while matching the state-of-the-art average-iterate convergence rate in finding NE for non-perturbed EFGs.

    "title": "MLPInit: Embarrassingly Simple GNN Training Acceleration with MLP Initialization",
    "abstract": "Training graph neural networks (GNNs) on large graphs is complex and extremely time consuming. This is attributed to overheads caused by sparse matrix multiplication, which are sidestepped when training multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) with only node features. MLPs, by ignoring graph context, are simple and faster for graph data, however they usually sacrifice prediction accuracy, limiting their applications for graph data. We observe that for most message passing-based GNNs, we can trivially derive an analog MLP (we call this a PeerMLP) with an equivalent weight space, by setting the trainable parameters with the same shapes, making us curious about how do GNNs using weights from a fully trained PeerMLP perform? Surprisingly, we find that GNNs initialized with such weights significantly outperform their PeerMLPs, motivating us to use PeerMLP training as a precursor, initialization step to GNN training. To this end, we propose an embarrassingly simple, yet hugely effective initialization method for GNN training acceleration, called \\mlpinit. Our extensive experiments on multiple large-scale graph datasets with diverse GNN architectures validate that MLPInit can accelerate the training of GNNs (up to 33× speedup on OGB-Products) and often improve prediction performance (e.g., up to \n7.97\n%\n improvement for GraphSAGE across \n7\n datasets for node classification, and up to \n17.81\n%\n improvement across \n4\n datasets for link prediction on metric Hits@10).

    "title": "Progressively Compressed Auto-Encoder for Self-supervised Representation Learning",
    "abstract": "As a typical self-supervised learning strategy, Masked Image Modeling (MIM) is driven by recovering all masked patches from visible ones. However, patches from the same image are highly correlated and it is redundant to reconstruct all the masked patches. We find that this redundancy is neglected by existing MIM based methods and causes non-negligible overheads in computation that do not necessarily benefit self-supervised representation. In this paper, we present a novel approach named PCAE, short for Progressively Compressed AutoEncoder, to address the redundant reconstruction issue by progressively compacting tokens and only retaining necessary information for forward propagation and reconstruction. In particular, we identify those redundant tokens in an image via a simple yet effective similarity metric between each token with the mean of the token sequence. Those redundant tokens that other ones can probably represent are progressively dropped accordingly during the forward propagation, and importantly, we only focus on reconstructing these retained tokens. As a result, we are able to achieve a better trade-off between performance and efficiency for pre-training. Besides, benefitting from the flexible strategy, PCAE can be also directly employed for downstream fine-tuning tasks and enable scalable deployment. Experiments show that PCAE achieves comparable performance to MAE with only 1/8 GPU days. The code is available at https://github.com/caddyless/PCAE/",

To address this issue, we propose to reparameterize and Gaussianize the latent tensors using novel differentiable data-dependent layers wherein custom operators are defined by solving optimization problems. These proposed layers constrain inverse problems to obtain high-fidelity in-distribution solutions.

We leverage the properties of the apparent similarity in high-resolution WSIs, which essentially exhibit \\textit{low-rank} structures in the data manifold, to develop a novel MIL with a boost in both feature embedding and feature aggregation. We extend the contrastive learning with a pathology-specific Low-Rank Constraint  (LRC) for feature embedding to pull together samples (i.e., patches) belonging to the same pathological tissue in the low-rank subspace and simultaneously push apart those from different latent subspaces. At the feature aggregation stage, we introduce an iterative low-rank attention MIL (ILRA-MIL) model to aggregate features with low-rank learnable latent vectors to model global interactions among all instances. We highlight the importance of instance correlation modeling but refrain from directly using the transformer encoder considering the \nO\n(\nn\n2\n)\n complexity.

    "title": "Rethinking the Effect of Data Augmentation in Adversarial Contrastive Learning",
    "abstract": "Recent works have shown that self-supervised learning can achieve remarkable robustness when integrated with adversarial training (AT). However, the robustness gap between supervised AT (sup-AT) and self-supervised AT (self-AT) remains significant. Motivated by this observation, we revisit existing self-AT methods and discover an inherent dilemma that affects self-AT robustness: either strong or weak data augmentations are harmful to self-AT, and a medium strength is insufficient to bridge the gap. To resolve this dilemma, we propose a simple remedy named DYNACL (Dynamic Adversarial Contrastive Learning). In particular, we propose an augmentation schedule that gradually anneals from a strong augmentation to a weak one to benefit from both extreme cases. Besides, we adopt a fast post-processing stage for adapting it to downstream tasks. Through extensive experiments, we show that DYNACL can improve state-of-the-art self-AT robustness by 8.84% under Auto-Attack on the CIFAR-10 dataset, and can even outperform vanilla supervised adversarial training for the first time.

    "abstract": "Motivated by the interests of social network analysis and network-based recommendation systems, we consider a semi-supervised community detection problem, where the goal is to estimate the community label of a new node by leveraging on the network structure and partially observed community labels of existing nodes. \nWe model the network with a degree-corrected stochastic block model, which allows for severe degree heterogeneity and potentially non-assortative communities. \nWe propose a fast algorithm that computes a `structural similarity metric' between the new node and each of the \nK\n communities, aggregating information in labeled and unlabeled data. The estimated label of the new node is equal to the value of \nk\n  that maximizes this similarity metric. Our method is computationally fast and compares favorably with existing semi-supervised algorithms on numerical performance. In theory, we derive explicit bounds for the misclassification error and show the efficiency of our method by comparing it with an ideal classifier. To our best knowledge, our results provide the first semi-supervised community detection algorithm with theoretical guarantees",

    "title": "DDM$^2$: Self-Supervised Diffusion MRI Denoising with Generative Diffusion Models",
    "abstract": "Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a common and life-saving medical imaging technique. However, acquiring high signal-to-noise ratio MRI scans requires long scan times, resulting in increased costs and patient discomfort, and decreased throughput. Thus, there is great interest in denoising MRI scans, especially for the subtype of diffusion MRI scans that are severely SNR-limited. While most prior MRI denoising methods are supervised in nature, acquiring supervised training datasets for the multitude of anatomies, MRI scanners, and scan parameters proves impractical. Here, we propose Denoising Diffusion Models for Denoising Diffusion MRI (DDM^2), a self-supervised denoising method for MRI denoising using diffusion denoising generative models. Our three-stage framework integrates statistic-based denoising theory into diffusion models and performs denoising through conditional generation. During inference, we represent input noisy measurements as a sample from an intermediate posterior distribution within the diffusion Markov chain. We conduct experiments on 4 real-world in-vivo diffusion MRI datasets and show that our DDM^2 demonstrates superior denoising performances ascertained with clinically-relevant visual qualitative and quantitative metrics",

    "abstract": "Recently pre-trained language models (PLMs) have prospered in various natural language generation (NLG) tasks due to their ability to generate fairly fluent text. Nevertheless, these models are observed to capture and reproduce harmful contents in training corpora, typically toxic language and social biases, raising severe moral issues. Prior works on ethical NLG tackle detoxifying and debiasing separately, which is problematic since we find debiased models still exhibit toxicity while detoxified ones even exacerbate biases. To address such a challenge, we propose the first unified framework of detoxifying and debiasing called UDDIA, which jointly formalizes these two problems as rectifying the output space. We theoretically interpret our framework as learning a text distribution mixing weighted attributes. Besides, UDDIA conducts adaptive optimization of only a few parameters during decoding based on a parameter-efficient tuning schema without any training data. This leads to minimal generation quality loss and improved rectification performance with acceptable computational cost. Experimental results demonstrate that compared to several strong baselines, UDDIA achieves debiasing and detoxifying simultaneously and better balances efficiency and effectiveness, taking a further step towards practical ethical NLG",

A number of techniques have been developed for ANN search that are efficient, accurate, and scalable. However, such techniques typically have a number of parameters that affect the speed-recall tradeoff, and exhibit poor performance when such parameters aren't properly set. Tuning these parameters has traditionally been a manual process, demanding in-depth knowledge of the underlying search algorithm. This is becoming an increasingly unrealistic demand as ANN search grows in popularity. To tackle this obstacle to ANN adoption, this work proposes a constrained optimization-based approach to tuning quantization-based ANN algorithms. Our technique takes just a desired search cost or recall as input, and then generates tunings that, empirically, are very close to the speed-recall Pareto frontier and give leading performance on standard benchmarks",

    "abstract": "Employing a forward diffusion chain to gradually map the data to a  noise distribution, diffusion-based generative models learn how to generate the data by inferring a reverse diffusion chain. However, this approach is slow and costly because it needs many forward and reverse steps. We propose a faster and cheaper approach that adds noise not until the data become pure random noise, but until they reach a hidden noisy data distribution that we can confidently learn. Then, we use fewer reverse steps to generate data by starting from this hidden distribution that is made similar to the noisy data. We reveal that the proposed model can be cast as an adversarial auto-encoder empowered by both the diffusion process and a learnable implicit prior. Experimental results show even with a significantly smaller number of reverse diffusion steps, the proposed truncated diffusion probabilistic models can provide consistent improvements over the non-truncated ones in terms of performance in both unconditional and text-guided image generations",

    "title": "NTK-SAP: Improving neural network pruning by aligning training dynamics",
    "abstract": "Pruning neural networks before training has received increasing interest due to its potential to reduce training time and memory. One popular method is to prune the connections based on a  certain metric, but it is not entirely clear what metric is the best choice. Recent advances in neural tangent kernel (NTK) theory suggest that the training dynamics of large enough neural networks is closely related to the spectrum of the NTK. Motivated by this finding, we propose to prune the connections that have the least influence on the spectrum of the NTK. This method can help maintain the NTK spectrum, which may help align the training dynamics to that of its dense counterpart. However, one possible issue is that the fixed-weight-NTK corresponding to a given initial point can be very different from the NTK corresponding to later iterates during the training phase. We further propose to sample multiple realizations of random weights to estimate the NTK spectrum. Note that our approach is weight-agnostic, which is different from most existing methods that are weight-dependent. In addition, we use random inputs to compute the fixed-weight-NTK, making our method data-agnostic as well. We name our foresight pruning algorithm Neural Tangent Kernel Spectrum-Aware Pruning (NTK-SAP). Empirically, our method achieves better performance than all baselines on multiple datasets",

    "title": "Effective Self-supervised Pre-training on Low-compute Networks without Distillation",
    "abstract": "Despite the impressive progress of self-supervised learning (SSL), its applicability to low-compute networks has received limited attention. Reported performance has trailed behind standard supervised pre-training by a large margin, barring self-supervised learning from making an impact on models that are deployed on device. Most prior works attribute this poor performance to the capacity bottleneck of the low-compute networks and opt to bypass the problem through the use of knowledge distillation (KD). In this work, we revisit SSL for efficient neural networks, taking a closer at what are the detrimental factors causing the practical limitations, and whether they are intrinsic to the self-supervised low-compute setting. We find that, contrary to accepted knowledge, there is no intrinsic architectural bottleneck, we diagnose that the performance bottleneck is related to the model complexity vs regularization strength trade-off. In particular, we start by empirically observing that the use of local views can have a dramatic impact on the effectiveness of the SSL methods. This hints at view sampling being one of the performance bottlenecks for SSL on low-capacity networks. We hypothesize that the view sampling strategy for large neural networks, which requires matching views in very diverse spatial scales and contexts, is too demanding for low-capacity architectures. We systematize the design of the view sampling mechanism, leading to a new training methodology that consistently improves the performance across different SSL methods (e.g. MoCo-v2, SwAV or DINO), different low-size networks (convolution-based networks, e.g. MobileNetV2, ResNet18, ResNet34 and vision transformer, e.g. ViT-Ti), and different tasks (linear probe, object detection, instance segmentation and semi-supervised learning). Our best models establish new state-of-the-art for SSL methods on low-compute networks despite not using a KD loss term. Code is publicly available at github.com/saic-fi/SSLight",

    "abstract": "Recent advancements in explainable machine learning provide effective and faithful solutions for interpreting model behaviors. However, many explanation methods encounter efficiency issues, which largely limit their deployments in practical scenarios. Real-time explainer (RTX) frameworks have thus been proposed to accelerate the model explanation process by learning an one-feed-forward explainer. Existing RTX frameworks typically build the explainer under the supervised learning paradigm, which requires large amounts of explanation labels as the ground truth. Considering that accurate explanation labels are usually hard to obtain, due to constrained computational resources and limited human efforts, effective explainer training is still challenging in practice. In this work, we propose a COntrastive Real-Time eXplanation (CoRTX) framework to learn the explanation-oriented representation and relieve the intensive dependence of explainer training on explanation labels. Specifically, we design a synthetic strategy to select positive and negative instances for explanation representation learning. Theoretical analysis show that our selection strategy can benefit the contrastive learning process on explanation tasks. Experimental results on three real-world datasets further demonstrate the efficiency and efficacy of our proposed CoRTX framework",

    "title": "OTOv2: Automatic, Generic, User-Friendly",
    "abstract": "The existing model compression methods via structured pruning typically require complicated multi-stage procedures. Each individual stage necessitates numerous engineering efforts and domain-knowledge from the end-users which prevent their wider applications onto broader scenarios. We propose the second generation of Only-Train-Once (OTOv2), which first automatically trains and compresses a general DNN only once from scratch to produce a more compact model with competitive performance without fine-tuning. OTOv2 is automatic and pluggable into various deep learning applications, and requires almost minimal engineering efforts from the users. Methodologically, OTOv2 proposes two major improvements: (i) Autonomy: automatically exploits the dependency of general DNNs, partitions the trainable variables into Zero-Invariant Groups (ZIGs), and constructs the compressed model; and (ii) Dual Half-Space Projected Gradient (DHSPG): a novel optimizer to more reliably solve structured-sparsity problems. Numerically, we demonstrate the generality and autonomy of OTOv2 on a variety of model architectures such as VGG, ResNet, CARN, ConvNeXt, DenseNet and StackedUnets, the majority of which cannot be handled by other methods without extensive handcrafting efforts. Together with benchmark datasets including CIFAR10/100, DIV2K, Fashion-MNIST, SVNH and ImageNet, its effectiveness is validated by performing competitively or even better than the state-of-the-arts.

This allows to obtain an explicit expression for the generating function of the sequence of loss values. By analyzing this generating function, we find, in particular, that 1) the SGD dynamics exhibits several convergent and divergent regimes depending on the spectral distributions of the problem; 2) the convergent regimes admit explicit stability conditions, and explicit loss asymptotics in the case of power-law spectral distributions; 3) the optimal convergence rate can be achieved at negative momenta.

    "title": "Bridging the Gap between ANNs and SNNs by Calibrating Offset Spikes",
    "abstract": "Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have attracted great attention due to their distinctive characteristics of low power consumption and temporal information processing. ANN-SNN conversion, as the most commonly used training method for applying SNNs, can ensure that converted SNNs achieve comparable performance to ANNs on large-scale datasets. However, the performance degrades severely under low quantities of time-steps, which hampers the practical applications of SNNs to neuromorphic chips. \nIn this paper, instead of evaluating different conversion errors and then eliminating these errors, we define an offset spike to measure the degree of deviation between actual and desired SNN firing rates. We perform a detailed analysis of offset spike and note that the firing of one additional (or one less) spike is the main cause of conversion errors. Based on this, we propose an optimization strategy based on shifting the initial membrane potential and we theoretically prove the corresponding optimal shifting distance for calibrating the spike. In addition, we also note that our method has a unique iterative property that enables further reduction of conversion errors. The experimental results show that our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet datasets. For example, we reach a top-1 accuracy of 67.12% on ImageNet when using 6 time-steps.

    "abstract": "Studies have shown that modern neural networks tend to be poorly calibrated due to over-confident predictions. Traditionally, post-processing methods have been used to calibrate the model after training. In recent years, various trainable calibration measures have been proposed to incorporate them directly into the training process. However, these methods all incorporate internal hyperparameters, and the performance of these calibration objectives relies on tuning these hyperparameters, incurring more computational costs as the size of neural networks and datasets become larger. As such, we present Expected Squared Difference (ESD), a tuning-free (i.e., hyperparameter-free) trainable calibration objective loss, where we view the calibration error from the perspective of the squared difference between the two expectations. With extensive experiments on several architectures (CNNs, Transformers) and datasets, we demonstrate that (1) incorporating ESD into the training improves model calibration in various batch size settings without the need for internal hyperparameter tuning, (2) ESD yields the best-calibrated results compared with previous approaches, and (3) ESD drastically improves the computational costs required for calibration during training due to the absence of internal hyperparameter.

A new flexible framework that allows users to pick certain regions of the background image and use it to guide the harmonization is proposed. Inspired by professional portrait harmonization users, we also introduce a new luminance matching loss to optimally match the color/luminance conditions between the composite foreground and select reference region. This framework provides more control to the image harmonization pipeline achieving visually pleasing portrait edits. Furthermore, we also introduce a new dataset carefully curated for validating portrait harmonization.

Most existing convolutional backbones follow the representation-to-classification paradigm, where representations of the input are firstly generated by category-agnostic convolutional operations, and then fed into classifiers for specific perceptual tasks (e.g., classification and segmentation). In this paper, we deviate from this classic paradigm and propose to augment potential category memberships as contextual priors in the convolution for contextualized representation learning. Specifically, top-k likely classes from the preceding stage are encoded as a contextual prior vector. Based on this vector and the preceding features, offsets for spatial sampling locations and kernel weights are generated to modulate the convolution operations. The new convolutions can readily replace their plain counterparts in existing CNNs and can be easily trained end-to-end by standard back-propagation without additional supervision. The qualities of Contextual Convolutional Networks make it compatible with a broad range of vision tasks and boost the state-of-the-art architecture ConvNeXt-Tiny by 1.8% on top-1 accuracy of ImageNet classification.

In resource allocation, it is crucial to quantify the variability of the resource received by the agents (such as blood banks and food banks) in addition to fairness and efficiency properties of the systems. For ad auction markets, it is important to establish statistical properties of the platform's revenues in addition to their expected values. To this end, we propose a statistical framework based on the concept of infinite-dimensional Fisher markets. In our framework, we observe a market formed by a finite number of items sampled from an underlying distribution (the ``observed market'') and aim to infer several important equilibrium quantities of the underlying long-run market. These equilibrium quantities include individual utilities, social welfare, and pacing multipliers. Through the lens of sample average approximation (SSA), we derive a collection of statistical results and show that the observed market provides useful statistical information of the long-run market. In other words, the equilibrium quantities of the observed market converge to the true ones of the long-run market with strong statistical guarantees. These include consistency, finite sample bounds, asymptotics, and confidence. As an extension, we discuss revenue inference in quasilinear Fisher markets",

    "abstract": "For long-tailed classification tasks, most works often pretrain a big model on a large-scale (unlabeled) dataset, and then fine-tune the whole pretrained  model for  adapting to long-tailed data. Though promising, fine-tuning the whole pretrained model tends to suffer from high cost in computation and deployment of different models for different tasks, as well as weakened generalization capability for overfitting to certain features of long-tailed data. To alleviate these issues, we propose an effective Long-tailed Prompt Tuning (LPT) method for long-tailed classification tasks. LPT introduces several trainable prompts into a frozen pretrained model to adapt it to long-tailed data. For better effectiveness, we divide prompts into two groups: 1) a shared prompt for the whole long-tailed dataset to learn general features and to adapt a pretrained model into the target long-tailed domain; and 2) group-specific prompts to gather group-specific features for the samples which have similar features and also to empower the pretrained model with fine-grained discrimination ability. Then we design a two-phase training paradigm to learn these prompts. In the first phase, we train the shared prompt via conventional supervised prompt tuning to adapt a pretrained model to the desired long-tailed domain. In the second phase, we use the learnt shared prompt as query to select a small best matched set for a group of similar samples from the group-specific prompt set to dig the common features of these similar samples, and then optimize these prompts with a dual sampling strategy and the asymmetric Gaussian Clouded Logit loss. By only fine-tuning a few prompts while fixing the pretrained model, LPT can reduce training cost and deployment cost by storing a few prompts, and enjoys a strong generalization ability of the pretrained model. Experiments show that on various long-tailed benchmarks, with only \n∼\n1.1\\% extra trainable parameters, LPT achieves comparable or higher performance than previous whole model fine-tuning methods, and is more robust to domain-shift",

To remedy this, several pioneering works design\ntiny face detectors through off-the-shelf neural architecture search (NAS) technologies,\nwhich are usually applied to the classification task.

    "abstract": "Video generation, with the purpose of producing a sequence of frames, requires synthesizing consistent and persistent dynamic contents over time. This work investigates how to model the temporal relations for composing a video with arbitrary number of frames, from a few to even infinite, using generative adversarial networks (GANs). First, towards composing adjacent frames, we show that the alias-free operation for single image generation, together with adequately pre-learned knowledge, bring a smooth frame transition without harming the per-frame quality. Second, through incorporating a temporal shift module (TSM), which is originally designed for video understanding, into the discriminator, we manage to advance the generator in synthesizing more reasonable dynamics.

    "title": "DiffMimic: Efficient Motion Mimicking with Differentiable Physics",
    "abstract": "Motion mimicking is a foundational task in physics-based character animation. However, most existing motion mimicking methods are built upon reinforcement learning (RL) and suffer from heavy reward engineering, high variance, and slow convergence with hard explorations. Specifically, they usually take tens of hours or even days of training to mimic a simple motion sequence, resulting in poor scalability. In this work, we leverage differentiable physics simulators (DPS) and propose an efficient motion mimicking method dubbed \nDiffMimic\n. Our key insight is that DPS casts a complex policy learning task to a much simpler state matching problem. In particular, DPS learns a stable policy by analytical gradients with ground-truth physical priors hence leading to significantly faster and stabler convergence than RL-based methods. Moreover, to escape from local optima, we utilize an \\textit{Demonstration Replay} mechanism to enable stable gradient backpropagation in a long horizon. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks show that DiffMimic has a better sample efficiency and time efficiency than existing methods (e.g., DeepMimic). Notably, DiffMimic allows a physically simulated character to learn back-flip after 10 minutes of training and be able to cycle it after 3 hours of training, while DeepMimic requires about a day of training to cycle back-flip. More importantly, we hope DiffMimic can benefit more differentiable animation systems with techniques like differentiable clothes simulation in future research.

    "title": "Knowledge Distillation based Degradation Estimation for Blind Super-Resolution",
    "abstract": "Blind image super-resolution (Blind-SR) aims to recover a high-resolution (HR) image from its corresponding low-resolution (LR) input image with unknown degradations. Most of the existing works design an explicit degradation estimator for each degradation to guide SR. However, it is infeasible to provide concrete labels of multiple degradation combinations (\\eg, blur, noise, jpeg compression) to supervise the degradation estimator training. In addition, these special designs for certain degradation, such as blur, impedes the models from being generalized to handle different degradations. To this end, it is necessary to design an implicit degradation estimator that can extract discriminative degradation representation for all degradations without relying on the supervision of degradation ground-truth. In this paper, we propose a Knowledge Distillation based Blind-SR network (KDSR). It consists of a knowledge distillation based implicit degradation estimator network (KD-IDE) and an efficient SR network. To learn the KDSR model, we first train a teacher network: KD-IDE\nT\n. It takes paired HR and LR patches as inputs and is optimized with the SR network jointly. Then, we further train a student network KD-IDE\nS\n, which only takes LR images as input and learns to extract the same implicit degradation representation (IDR) as KD-IDE\nT\n. In addition, to fully use extracted IDR, we design a simple, strong, and efficient IDR based dynamic convolution residual block (IDR-DCRB) to build an SR network. We conduct extensive experiments under classic and real-world degradation settings. The results show that KDSR achieves SOTA performance and can generalize to various degradation processes. The source codes and pre-trained models will be released",

    "title": "Graph Contrastive Learning for Skeleton-based Action Recognition",
    "abstract": "In the field of skeleton-based action recognition, current top-performing graph convolutional networks (GCNs) exploit intra-sequence context to construct adaptive graphs for feature aggregation. However, we argue that such context is still \nlocal\n since the rich cross-sequence relations have not been explicitly investigated. In this paper, we propose a graph contrastive learning framework for skeleton-based action recognition (\nSkeletonGCL\n) to explore the \nglobal\n context across all sequences. In specific, SkeletonGCL associates graph learning across sequences by enforcing graphs to be class-discriminative, i.e., intra-class compact and inter-class dispersed, which improves the GCN capacity to distinguish various action patterns. Besides, two memory banks are designed to enrich cross-sequence context from two complementary levels, i.e., instance and semantic levels, enabling graph contrastive learning in multiple context scales. Consequently, SkeletonGCL establishes a new training paradigm, and it can be seamlessly incorporated into current GCNs. Without loss of generality, we combine SkeletonGCL with three GCNs (2S-ACGN, CTR-GCN, and InfoGCN), and achieve consistent improvements on NTU60, NTU120, and NW-UCLA benchmarks",

    "abstract": "Analogical reasoning is fundamental to human cognition and holds an important place in various fields. However, previous studies mainly focus on single-modal analogical reasoning and ignore taking advantage of structure knowledge. Notably, the research in cognitive psychology has demonstrated that information from multimodal sources always brings more powerful cognitive transfer than single modality sources. To this end, we introduce the new task of multimodal analogical reasoning over knowledge graphs, which requires multimodal reasoning ability with the help of background knowledge. Specifically, we construct a Multimodal Analogical Reasoning dataSet (MARS) and a multimodal knowledge graph MarKG. We evaluate with multimodal knowledge graph embedding and pre-trained Transformer baselines, illustrating the potential challenges of the proposed task. We further propose a novel model-agnostic Multimodal analogical reasoning framework with Transformer (MarT) motivated by the structure mapping theory, which can obtain better performance.

    "title": "MECTA: Memory-Economic Continual Test-Time Model Adaptation",
    "abstract": "Continual Test-time Adaptation (CTA) is a promising art to secure accuracy gains in continually-changing environments. The state-of-the-art adaptations improve out-of-distribution model accuracy via computation-efficient online test-time gradient descents but meanwhile cost about times of memory versus the inference, even if only a small portion of parameters are updated. Such high memory consumption of CTA substantially impedes wide applications of advanced CTA on memory-constrained devices. In this paper, we provide a novel solution, dubbed MECTA, to drastically improve the memory efficiency of gradient-based CTA. Our profiling shows that the major memory overhead comes from the intermediate cache for back-propagation, which scales by the batch size, channel, and layer number. Therefore, we propose to reduce batch sizes, adopt an adaptive normalization layer to maintain stable and accurate predictions, and stop the back-propagation caching heuristically. On the other hand, we prune the networks to reduce the computation and memory overheads in optimization and recover the parameters afterward to avoid forgetting. The proposed MECTA is efficient and can be seamlessly plugged into state-of-the-art CTA algorithms at negligible overhead on computation and memory. On three datasets, CIFAR10, CIFAR100, and ImageNet, MECTA improves the accuracy by at least 6% with constrained memory and significantly reduces the memory costs of ResNet50 on ImageNet by at least 70% with comparable accuracy.

    "abstract": "Interpretability is a pressing issue for machine learning. Common approaches to interpretable machine learning constrain interactions between features of the input, sacrificing model complexity in order to render more comprehensible the effects of those features on the model's output. We approach interpretability from a new angle: constrain the information about the features without restricting the complexity of the model. We use the Distributed Information Bottleneck to optimally compress each feature so as to maximally preserve information about the output. The learned information allocation, by feature and by feature value, provides rich opportunities for interpretation, particularly in problems with many features and complex feature interactions. The central object of analysis is not a single trained model, but rather a spectrum of models serving as approximations that leverage variable amounts of information about the inputs. Information is allocated to features by their relevance to the output, thereby solving the problem of feature selection by constructing a learned continuum of feature inclusion-to-exclusion. The optimal compression of each feature---at every stage of approximation---allows fine-grained inspection of the distinctions among feature values that are most impactful for prediction. We develop a framework for extracting insight from the spectrum of approximate models and demonstrate its utility on a range of tabular datasets",

In this paper, we focus on offline RL with linear function approximation and propose a new pessimism-based algorithm for offline linear MDP. At the core of our algorithm is the uncertainty decomposition via a reference function, which is new in the literature of offline RL under linear function approximation. Theoretical analysis demonstrates that our algorithm can match the performance lower bound up to logarithmic factors. We also extend our techniques to the two-player zero-sum Markov games (MGs), and establish a new performance lower bound for MGs, which tightens the existing result, and verifies the nearly minimax optimality of the proposed algorithm. To the best of our knowledge, these are the first computationally efficient and nearly minimax optimal algorithms for offline single-agent MDPs and MGs with linear function approximation",

To this end, we present ManiSkill2, the next generation of the SAPIEN ManiSkill benchmark, to address critical pain points often encountered by researchers when using benchmarks for generalizable manipulation skills. ManiSkill2 includes 20 manipulation task families with 2000+ object models and 4M+ demonstration frames, which cover stationary/mobile-base, single/dual-arm, and rigid/soft-body manipulation tasks with 2D/3D-input data simulated by fully dynamic engines.

Moreover, it empowers fast visual input learning algorithms so that a CNN-based policy can collect samples at about 2000 FPS with 1 GPU and 16 processes on a regular workstation. It implements a render server infrastructure to allow sharing rendering resources across all environments, thereby significantly reducing memory usage.

    "title": "Deja Vu: Continual Model Generalization for Unseen Domains",
    "abstract": "In real-world applications, deep learning models often run in non-stationary environments where the target data distribution continually shifts over time. There have been numerous domain adaptation (DA) methods in both online and offline modes to improve cross-domain adaptation ability. However, these DA methods typically only provide good performance after a long period of adaptation, and perform poorly on new domains before and during adaptation – in what we call the “Unfamiliar Period”, especially when domain shifts happen suddenly and significantly. On the other hand, domain generalization (DG) methods have been proposed to improve the model generalization ability on unadapted domains. However, existing DG works are ineffective for continually changing domains due to severe catastrophic forgetting of learned knowledge. To overcome these limitations of DA and DG in handling the Unfamiliar Period during continual domain shift, we propose RaTP, a framework that focuses on improving models’ target domain generalization (TDG) capability, while also achieving effective target domain adaptation (TDA) capability right after training on certain domains and forgetting alleviation (FA) capability on past domains. RaTP includes a training-free data augmentation module to prepare data for TDG, a novel pseudo-labeling mechanism to provide reliable supervision for TDA, and a prototype contrastive alignment algorithm to align different domains for achieving TDG, TDA and FA. Extensive experiments on Digits, PACS, and DomainNet demonstrate that RaTP significantly outperforms state-of-the-art works from Continual DA, Source-Free DA, Test-Time/Online DA, Single DG, Multiple DG and Unified DA&DG in TDG, and achieves comparable TDA and FA capabilities",

At sufficient resolution, the cryo-EM maps, along with some knowledge about the imaged molecules, allow de novo atomic modelling. Typically, this is done through a laborious manual process. Recent advances in machine learning applications to protein structure prediction show potential for automating this process. Taking inspiration from these techniques, we have built ModelAngelo for automated model building of proteins in cryo-EM maps. ModelAngelo first uses a residual convolutional neural network (CNN) to initialize a graph representation with nodes assigned to individual amino acids of the proteins in the map and edges representing the protein chain. The graph is then refined with a graph neural network (GNN) that combines the cryo-EM data, the amino acid sequence data and prior knowledge about protein geometries. The GNN refines the geometry of the protein chain and classifies the amino acids for each of its nodes. The final graph is post-processed with a hidden Markov model (HMM) search to map each protein chain to entries in a user provided sequence file. Application to 28 test cases shows that ModelAngelo outperforms state-of-the-art and approximates manual building for cryo-EM maps with resolutions better than 3.5 A",

CD optimizes an input mask to extract a small pattern from the input image that can lead to the same model output (i.e., logits or deep features). The extracted pattern can help understand the cognitive mechanism of a model on clean vs. backdoor images and is thus called a \\emph{Cognitive Pattern} (CP). Using CD and the distilled CPs, we uncover an interesting phenomenon of backdoor attacks: despite the various forms and sizes of trigger patterns used by different attacks, the CPs of backdoor samples are all surprisingly and suspiciously small. \nOne thus can leverage the learned mask to detect and remove backdoor examples from poisoned training datasets. \nWe conduct extensive experiments to show that CD can robustly detect a wide range of advanced backdoor attacks.\nWe also show that CD can potentially be applied to help detect potential biases from face datasets.\nCode is available at https://github.com/HanxunH/CognitiveDistillation",

A revocable action framework is devised to improve the agent's flexibility against the complex constrained GM. Moreover, we propose a quadratic approximation technique to regularize the affinity score, in the presence of outliers. As such, the agent can finish inlier matching timely when the affinity score stops growing, for which otherwise an additional parameter i.e. the number of inliers is needed to avoid matching outliers. In this paper, we focus on learning the back-end solver under the most general form of GM: the Lawler's QAP, whose input is the affinity matrix. Especially, our approach can also boost existing GM methods that use such input. Experiments on multiple real-world datasets demonstrate its performance regarding both accuracy and robustness",

In this study, we propose a unified offline policy optimization approach, \\textit{RGM (Reward Gap Minimization)}, which can smartly handle diverse types of imperfect rewards. RGM is formulated as a bi-level optimization problem: the upper layer optimizes a reward correction term that performs visitation distribution matching w.r.t. some expert data; the lower layer solves a pessimistic RL problem with the corrected rewards. By exploiting the duality of the lower layer, we derive a tractable algorithm that enables sampled-based learning without any online interactions.  Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that RGM achieves superior performance to existing methods under diverse settings of imperfect rewards. Further, RGM can effectively correct wrong or inconsistent rewards against expert preference and retrieve useful information from biased rewards.

VLMs have a flexible text encoder that can represent arbitrary classes as natural language prompts but they often underperform task-specific architectures on the compositional zero-shot benchmark datasets. CSP treats the attributes and objects that define classes as learnable tokens of vocabulary. During training, the vocabulary is tuned to recognize classes that compose tokens in multiple ways (e.g., old cat and white cat). At test time, we recompose the learned attribute-object vocabulary in new combinations to recognize novel classes. We show that CSP outperforms the CLIP on benchmark datasets by an average of 10.9 percentage points on AUC. CSP also outperforms CoOp, a soft prompting method that fine-tunes the prefix context tokens, by an average of 5.8 percentage points on AUC.

    "abstract": "This work establishes rigorous, novel and widely applicable stability guarantees and transferability bounds for general graph convolutional networks  -- without reference to any underlying limit object or statistical distribution. Crucially, utilized graph-shift operators are not necessarily assumed to be normal, allowing for the treatment of networks on both directed- and undirected graphs within the developed framework. In the undirected setting, stability to node-level perturbations is related to an 'adequate spectral covering' property of the filters in each layer. Stability to edge-level perturbations is discussed and related to properties of the utilized filters such as their Lipschitz constants. Results on stability to  vertex-set non-preserving perturbations are obtained by utilizing recently developed mathematical-physics based tools. As an exemplifying application of the developed theory, it is showcased that\ngeneral graph convolutional networks utilizing the un-normalized graph Laplacian as graph-shift-operator  can be rendered stable to collapsing strong edges in the underlying graph if filters are mandated to be constant at infinity. These theoretical results are supported by corresponding numerical investigations showcasing the response of filters and networks to such perturbations",

    "title": "De Novo Molecular Generation via Connection-aware Motif Mining",
    "abstract": "De novo molecular generation is an essential task for science discovery. Recently, fragment-based deep generative models have attracted much research attention due to their flexibility in generating novel molecules based on existing molecule fragments. However, the motif vocabulary, i.e., the collection of frequent fragments, is usually built upon heuristic rules, which brings difficulties to capturing common substructures from large amounts of molecules. In this work, we propose MiCaM to generate molecules based on mined connection-aware motifs. Specifically, it leverages a data-driven algorithm to automatically discover motifs from a molecule library by iteratively merging subgraphs based on their frequency. The obtained motif vocabulary consists of not only molecular motifs (i.e., the frequent fragments), but also their connection information, indicating how the motifs are connected with each other. Based on the mined connection-aware motifs, MiCaM builds a connection-aware generator, which simultaneously picks up motifs and determines how they are connected. We test our method on distribution-learning benchmarks (i.e., generating novel molecules to resemble the distribution of a given training set) and goal-directed benchmarks (i.e., generating molecules with target properties), and achieve significant improvements over previous fragment-based baselines. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our method can effectively mine domain-specific motifs for different tasks",

    "title": "Revisiting the Entropy Semiring for Neural Speech Recognition",
    "abstract": "In streaming settings, speech recognition models have to map sub-sequences of speech to text before the full audio stream becomes available. However, since alignment information between speech and text is rarely available during training, models need to learn it in a completely self-supervised way. In practice, the exponential number of possible alignments makes this extremely challenging, with models often learning peaky or sub-optimal alignments. Prima facie, the exponential nature of the alignment space makes it difficult to even quantify the uncertainty of a model's alignment distribution. Fortunately, it has been known for decades that the entropy of a probabilistic finite state transducer can be computed in time linear to the size of the transducer via a dynamic programming reduction based on semirings. In this work, we revisit the entropy semiring for neural speech recognition models, and show how alignment entropy can be used to supervise models through regularization or distillation. We also contribute an open-source implementation of CTC and RNN-T in the semiring framework that includes numerically stable and highly parallel variants of the entropy semiring. Empirically, we observe that the addition of alignment distillation improves the accuracy and latency of an already well-optimized teacher-student distillation model, achieving state-of-the-art performance on the Librispeech dataset in the streaming scenario",

    "title": "Alternating Differentiation for Optimization Layers",
    "abstract": "The idea of embedding optimization problems into deep neural networks as optimization layers to encode constraints and inductive priors has taken hold in recent years. Most existing methods focus on implicitly differentiating Karush–Kuhn–Tucker (KKT) conditions in a way that requires expensive computations on the Jacobian matrix, which can be slow and memory-intensive. In this paper, we developed a new framework, named Alternating Differentiation (Alt-Diff), that differentiates optimization problems (here, specifically in the form of convex optimization problems with polyhedral constraints) in a fast and recursive way. Alt-Diff decouples the differentiation procedure into a primal update and a dual update in an alternating way. Accordingly, Alt-Diff substantially decreases the dimensions of the Jacobian matrix especially for optimization with large-scale constraints and thus increases the computational speed of implicit differentiation. We show that the gradients obtained by Alt-Diff are consistent with those obtained by differentiating KKT conditions. In addition, we propose to truncate Alt-Diff to further accelerate the computational speed. Under some standard assumptions, we show that the truncation error of gradients is upper bounded by the same order of variables' estimation error. Therefore, Alt-Diff can be truncated to further increase computational speed without sacrificing much accuracy. A series of comprehensive experiments validate the superiority of Alt-Diff",

    "abstract": "Model extraction attacks are proven to be a severe privacy threat to Machine Learning as a Service (MLaaS). A variety of techniques have been designed to steal a remote machine learning model with high accuracy and fidelity. However, how to extract a robust model with similar resilience against adversarial attacks is never investigated. This paper presents the first study toward this goal. We first analyze those existing extraction solutions either fail to maintain the model accuracy or model robustness or lead to the robust overfitting issue. Then we propose Boundary Entropy Searching Thief (BEST), a novel model extraction attack to achieve both accuracy and robustness extraction under restricted attack budgets. BEST generates a new kind of uncertain examples for querying and reconstructing the victim model. These samples have uniform confidence scores across different classes, which can perfectly balance the trade-off between model accuracy and robustness. Extensive experiments demonstrate that BEST outperforms existing attack methods over different datasets and model architectures under limited data.

Motivated by the bird’s-eye-view (BEV) representation commonly used in vision and robotics, we propose conditional neural groundplans, ground-aligned 2D feature grids, as persistent and memory-efficient scene representations. Our method is trained self-supervised from unlabeled multi-view observations using differentiable rendering, and learns to complete geometry and appearance of occluded regions. In addition, we show that we can leverage multi-view videos at training time to learn to separately reconstruct static and movable components of the scene from a single image at test time. The ability to separately reconstruct movable objects enables a variety of downstream tasks using simple heuristics, such as extraction of object-centric 3D representations, novel view synthesis, instance-level segmentation, 3D bounding box prediction, and scene editing. This highlights the value of neural groundplans as a backbone for efficient 3D scene understanding models",

Specifically, we establish a sharp error bound for fitted Q-evaluation, which depends on the intrinsic dimension of the state-action space, the smoothness of Bellman operator, and a function class-restricted \nχ\n2\n-divergence. It is noteworthy that the restricted \nχ\n2\n-divergence measures the behavior and target policies' {\\it mismatch in the function space}, which can be small even if the two policies are not close to each other in their tabular forms.

    "title": "Stochastic Differentially Private and Fair Learning",
    "abstract": "Machine learning models are increasingly used in high-stakes decision-making systems. In such applications, a major concern is that these models sometimes discriminate against certain demographic groups such as individuals with certain race, gender, or age. Another major concern in these applications is the violation of the privacy of users. While fair learning algorithms have been developed to mitigate discrimination issues, these algorithms can still leak sensitive information, such as individuals’ health or financial records. Utilizing the notion of differential privacy (DP), prior works aimed at developing learning algorithms that are both private and fair. However, existing algorithms for DP fair learning are either not guaranteed to converge or require full batch of data in each iteration of the algorithm to converge. In this paper, we provide the first stochastic differentially private algorithm for fair learning that is guaranteed to converge. Here, the term “stochastic\" refers to the fact that our proposed algorithm converges even when minibatches of data are used at each iteration (i.e. stochastic optimization). Our framework is flexible enough to permit different fairness notions, including demographic parity and equalized odds. In addition, our algorithm can be applied to non-binary classification tasks with multiple (non-binary) sensitive attributes. As a byproduct of our convergence analysis, we provide the first utility guarantee for a DP algorithm for solving nonconvex-strongly concave min-max problems. Our numerical experiments show that the proposed algorithm consistently offers significant performance gains over the state-of-the-art baselines, and can be applied to larger scale problems with non-binary target/sensitive attributes",

    "title": "On The Inadequacy of Optimizing Alignment and Uniformity in Contrastive Learning of Sentence Representations",
    "abstract": "Contrastive learning is widely used in areas such as visual representation learning (VRL) and sentence representation learning (SRL). Considering the differences between VRL and SRL in terms of negative sample size and evaluation focus, we believe that the solid findings obtained in VRL may not be entirely carried over to SRL. In this work, we consider the suitability of the decoupled form of contrastive loss, i.e., alignment and uniformity, in SRL. We find a performance gap between sentence representations obtained by jointly optimizing alignment and uniformity on the STS task and those obtained using contrastive loss. Further, we find that the joint optimization of alignment and uniformity during training is prone to overfitting, which does not occur on the contrastive loss. Analyzing them based on the variation of the gradient norms, we find that there is a property of ``gradient dissipation'' in contrastive loss and believe that it is the key to preventing overfitting. We simulate similar \"gradient dissipation\" of contrastive loss on four optimization objectives of two forms, and achieve the same or even better performance than contrastive loss on the STS tasks, confirming our hypothesis",

    "title": "Volumetric Optimal Transportation by Fast Fourier Transform",
    "abstract": "The optimal transportation map finds the most economical way to transport one probability measure to another, and it has been applied in a broad range of applications in machine learning and computer vision. By the Brenier theory, computing the optimal transport map is equivalent to solving a Monge-Amp\\`ere equation, which is highly non-linear. Therefore, the computation of optimal transportation maps is intrinsically challenging.\n\nIn this work, we propose a novel and powerful method, the FFT-OT (fast Fourier transform-optimal transport), to compute the 3-dimensional OT problems. The method is based on several key ideas: first, the Monge-Amp\\`ere equation is linearized to a sequence of linear elliptic PDEs with spacial and temporal variant coefficients; second, the obliqueness property of optimal transportation maps is reformulated as a Neumann boundary condition; and third, the variant coefficient elliptic PDEs are approximated by constant coefficient elliptic PDEs and solved by FFT on GPUs. We also prove that the algorithm converges linearly, namely the approximation error decreases exponentially fast. Experimental results show that the FFT-OT algorithm is more than a hundred times faster than the conventional methods based on the convex geometry. Furthermore, the method can be directly applied for sampling from complex 3D density functions in machine learning and magnifying the volumetric data in medical imaging",

    "title": "Dilated convolution with learnable spacings",
    "abstract": "Recent works indicate that convolutional neural networks (CNN) need large receptive fields (RF) to compete with visual transformers and their attention mechanism. In CNNs, RFs can simply be enlarged by increasing the convolution kernel sizes. Yet the number of trainable parameters, which scales quadratically with the kernel's size in the 2D case, rapidly becomes prohibitive, and the training is notoriously difficult. This paper presents a new method to increase the RF size without increasing the number of parameters. The dilated convolution (DC) has already been proposed for the same purpose. DC can be seen as a convolution with a kernel that contains only a few non-zero elements placed on a regular grid. Here we present a new version of the DC in which the spacings between the non-zero elements, or equivalently their positions, are no longer fixed but learnable via backpropagation thanks to an interpolation technique. We call this method “Dilated Convolution with Learnable Spacings” (DCLS) and generalize it to the n-dimensional convolution case. However, our main focus here will be on the 2D case. We first tried our approach on ResNet50: we drop-in replaced the standard convolutions with DCLS ones, which increased the accuracy of ImageNet1k classification at iso-parameters, but at the expense of the throughput. Next, we used the recent ConvNeXt state-of-the-art convolutional architecture and drop-in replaced the depthwise convolutions with DCLS ones. This not only increased the accuracy of ImageNet1k classification but also of typical downstream and robustness tasks, again at iso-parameters but this time with negligible cost on throughput, as ConvNeXt uses separable convolutions. Conversely, classic DC led to poor performance with both ResNet50 and ConvNeXt. The code of the method is based on PyTorch and available at: https://github.com/K-H-Ismail/Dilated-Convolution-with-Learnable-Spacings-PyTorch",

Such strictly-ordered discrete factorization however falls short of capturing key properties of chirographic data -- it fails to build holistic understanding of the temporal concept due to one-way visibility (causality). Consequently, temporal data has been modelled as discrete token sequences of fixed sampling rate instead of capturing the true underlying concept. In this paper, we introduce a powerful model-class namely Denoising\\ Diffusion\\ Probabilistic\\ Models or DDPMs for chirographic data that specifically addresses these flaws. Our model named \"ChiroDiff\", being non-autoregressive, learns to capture holistic concepts and therefore remains resilient to higher temporal sampling rate up to a good extent.

We further show some unique use-cases like stochastic vectorization, de-noising/healing, abstraction are also possible with this model-class.

Despite the advance of CNNs in image demoir\ne\n´\ning, existing networks are with heavy design, causing massive computation burden for mobile devices. In this paper, we launch the first study on accelerating demoir\ne\n´\ning networks and propose a dynamic demoir\ne\n´\ning acceleration method (DDA) towards a real-time deployment on mobile devices. Our stimulus stems from a simple-yet-universal fact that moir\n\\'\ne\n patterns often unbalancedly distribute across an image. Consequently, excessive computation is wasted upon non-moir\ne\n´\n areas. Therefore, we reallocate computation costs in proportion to the complexity of image patches. In order to achieve this aim, we measure the complexity of an image patch by a novel moir\ne\n´\n prior that considers both colorfulness and frequency information of moir\ne\n´\n patterns. Then, we restore higher-complex image patches using larger networks and the lower-complex ones are assigned with smaller networks to relieve the computation burden. At last, we train all networks in a parameter-shared supernet paradigm to avoid additional parameter burden. Extensive experiments on several benchmarks demonstrate the efficacy of our DDA. In addition, the acceleration evaluated on the VIVO X80 Pro smartphone equipped with the chip of Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 also shows that our method can drastically reduce the inference time, leading to a real-time image demoir\ne\n´\ning on mobile devices.

    "abstract": "The conventional few-shot classification aims at learning a model on a large labeled base dataset and rapidly adapting to a target dataset that is from the same distribution as the base dataset. However, in practice, the base and the target datasets of few-shot classification are usually from different domains, which is the problem of cross-domain few-shot classification. We tackle this problem by making a small proportion of unlabeled images in the target domain accessible in the training stage. In this setup, even though the base data are sufficient and labeled, the large domain shift still makes transferring the knowledge from the base dataset difficult. We meticulously design a cross-level knowledge distillation method, which can strengthen the ability of the model to extract more discriminative features in the target dataset by guiding the network's shallow layers to learn higher-level information. Furthermore, in order to alleviate the overfitting in the evaluation stage, we propose a feature denoising operation which can reduce the feature redundancy and mitigate overfitting. Our approach can surpass the previous state-of-the-art method, Dynamic-Distillation, by 5.44% on 1-shot and 1.37% on 5-shot classification tasks on average in the BSCD-FSL benchmark.

This paper introduces trainability preserving pruning (TPP), a scalable method to preserve network trainability against pruning, aiming for improved pruning performance and being more robust to retraining hyper-parameters (e.g., learning rate). Specifically, we propose to penalize the gram matrix of convolutional filters to decorrelate the pruned filters from the retained filters. In addition to the convolutional layers, per the spirit of preserving the trainability of the whole network, we also propose to regularize the batch normalization parameters (scale and bias). Empirical studies on linear MLP networks show that TPP can perform on par with the oracle trainability recovery scheme. On nonlinear ConvNets (ResNet56/VGG19) on CIFAR10/100, TPP outperforms the other counterpart approaches by an obvious margin. Moreover, results on ImageNet-1K with ResNets suggest that TPP consistently performs more favorably against other top-performing structured pruning approaches.

    "abstract": "Recent multi-modal contrastive learning models have demonstrated the ability to learn an embedding space suitable for building strong vision classifiers, by leveraging the rich information in large-scale image-caption datasets. Our work highlights a distinct advantage of this multi-modal embedding space: the ability to diagnose vision classifiers through natural language. The traditional process of diagnosing model behaviors in deployment settings involves labor-intensive data acquisition and annotation. Our proposed method can discover high-error data slices, identify influential attributes and further rectify undesirable model behaviors, without requiring any visual data. Through a combination of theoretical explanation and empirical verification, we present conditions under which classifiers trained on embeddings from one modality can be equivalently applied to embeddings from another modality. On a range of image datasets with known error slices, we demonstrate that our method can effectively identify the error slices and influential attributes, and can further use language to rectify failure modes of the classifier",

    "title": "Harnessing Out-Of-Distribution Examples via Augmenting Content and Style",
    "abstract": "Machine learning models are vulnerable to Out-Of-Distribution (OOD) examples, such a problem has drawn much attention. However, current methods lack a full understanding of different types of OOD data: there are benign OOD data that can be properly adapted to enhance the learning performance, while other malign OOD data would severely degenerate the classification result. To Harness OOD data, this paper proposes HOOD method that can leverage the content and style from each image instance to identify benign and malign OOD data. Particularly, we design a variational inference framework to causally disentangle content and style features by constructing a structural causal model. Subsequently, we augment the content and style through an intervention process to produce malign and benign OOD data, respectively. The benign OOD data contain novel styles but hold our interested contents, and they can be leveraged to help train a style-invariant model. In contrast, the malign OOD data inherit unknown contents but carry familiar styles, by detecting them can improve model robustness against deceiving anomalies. Thanks to the proposed novel disentanglement and data augmentation techniques, HOOD can effectively deal with OOD examples in unknown and open environments, whose effectiveness is empirically validated in three typical OOD applications including OOD detection, open-set semi-supervised learning, and open-set domain adaptation",

    "abstract": "A standard hardware bottleneck when training deep neural networks is GPU memory. The bulk of memory is occupied by caching intermediate tensors for gradient computation in the backward pass. We propose a novel method to reduce this footprint - Dropping Intermediate Tensors (DropIT).  DropIT drops min-k elements of the intermediate tensors and approximates gradients from the sparsified tensors in the backward pass. Theoretically, DropIT reduces noise on estimated gradients and therefore has a higher rate of convergence than vanilla-SGD. Experiments show that we can drop up to 90\\% of the intermediate tensor elements in fully-connected and convolutional layers while achieving higher testing accuracy for Visual Transformers and Convolutional Neural Networks on various tasks (e.g., classification, object detection, instance segmentation).

    "title": "A Unified Framework for Soft Threshold Pruning",
    "abstract": "Soft threshold pruning is among the cutting-edge pruning methods with state-of-the-art performance. However, previous methods either perform aimless searching on the threshold scheduler or simply set the threshold trainable, lacking theoretical explanation from a unified perspective. In this work, we reformulate soft threshold pruning as an implicit optimization problem solved using the Iterative Shrinkage-Thresholding Algorithm (ISTA), a classic method from the fields of sparse recovery and compressed sensing. Under this theoretical framework, all threshold tuning strategies proposed in previous studies of soft threshold pruning are concluded as different styles of tuning \nL\n1\n-regularization term. We further derive an optimal threshold scheduler through an in-depth study of threshold scheduling based on our framework. This scheduler keeps \nL\n1\n-regularization coefficient stable, implying a time-invariant objective function from the perspective of optimization. In principle, the derived pruning algorithm could sparsify any mathematical model trained via SGD. We conduct extensive experiments and verify its state-of-the-art performance on both Artificial Neural Networks (ResNet-50 and MobileNet-V1) and Spiking Neural Networks (SEW ResNet-18) on ImageNet datasets. On the basis of this framework, we derive a family of pruning methods, including sparsify-during-training, early pruning, and pruning at initialization.

    "title": "TaskPrompter: Spatial-Channel Multi-Task Prompting for Dense Scene Understanding",
    "abstract": "Learning effective representations simultaneously from multiple tasks in a unified network framework is a fundamental paradigm for multi-task dense visual scene understanding. This requires joint modeling (i) task-generic and (ii) task-specific representations, and (iii) cross-task representation interactions. Existing works typically model these three perspectives with separately designed structures, using shared network modules for task-generic learning, different modules for task-specific learning, and establishing connections among these components for cross-task interactions. It is barely explored in the literature to model these three perspectives in each network layer in an end-to-end manner, which can not only minimize the effort of carefully designing empirical structures for the three multi-task representation learning objectives, but also greatly improve the representation learning capability of the multi-task network since all the model capacity will be used to optimize the three objectives together. In this paper, we propose TaskPrompter, a novel spatial-channel multi-task prompting transformer framework to achieve this target. Specifically, we design a set of spatial-channel task prompts and learn their spatial- and channel interactions with the shared image tokens in each transformer layer with attention mechanism, as aggregating spatial and channel information is critical for dense prediction tasks. Each task prompt learns task-specific representation for one task, while all the prompts can jointly contribute to the learning of the shared image token representations, and the interactions between different task prompts model the cross-task relationship. To decode dense predictions for multiple tasks with the learned spatial-channel task prompts from transformer, we accordingly design a dense task prompt decoding mechanism, which queries the shared image tokens using task prompts to obtain spatial- and channel-wise task-specific representations. Extensive experiments on two challenging multi-task dense scene understanding benchmarks (i.e. NYUD-V2 and PASCAL-Context) show the superiority of the proposed framework and TaskPrompter establishes significant state-of-the-art performances on multi-task dense predictions.

    "abstract": "In clinical environments, image-based diagnosis is desired to achieve robustness on multi-center samples. Toward this goal, a natural way is to capture only clinically disease-related features. However, such disease-related features are often entangled with center-effect, disabling robust transferring to unseen centers/domains. To disentangle disease-related features, we first leverage structural causal modeling to explicitly model disease-related and center-effects that are provable to be disentangled from each other. Guided by this, we propose a novel Domain Agnostic Representation Model (DarMo) based on variational Auto-Encoder. To facilitate disentanglement, we design domain-agnostic and domain-aware encoders to respectively capture disease-related features and varied center-effects by incorporating a domain-aware batch normalization layer. Besides, we constrain the disease-related features to well predict the disease label as well as clinical attributes, by leveraging Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) into our decoder. The effectiveness and utility of our method are demonstrated by the superior performance over others on both public datasets and inhouse datasets",

    "abstract": "Probabilistic logical rule learning has shown great strength in logical rule mining and knowledge graph completion. It learns logical rules to predict missing edges by reasoning on existing edges in the knowledge graph. However, previous efforts have largely been limited to only modeling chain-like Horn clauses such as R1(x; z) ^ R2(z; y) ) H(x; y). This formulation overlooks additional contextual information from neighboring sub-graphs of entity variables x, y and z. Intuitively, there is a large gap here, as local sub-graphs have been found to provide important information for knowledge graph completion. Inspired by these observations, we propose Logical Entity RePresentation (LERP) to encode contextual information of entities in the knowledge graph. A LERP is designed as a vector of probabilistic logical functions on the entity’s neighboring sub-graph. It is an interpretable representation while allowing for differentiable optimization. We can then incorporate LERP into probabilistic logical rule learning to learn more expressive rules. Empirical results demonstrate that with LERP, our model outperforms other rule learning methods in knowledge graph completion and is comparable or even superior to state-of-the-art black-box methods. Moreover, we find that our model can discover a more expressive family of logical rules. LERP can also be further combined with embedding learning methods like TransE to make it more interpretable",

    "title": "BEVDistill: Cross-Modal BEV Distillation for Multi-View 3D Object Detection",
    "abstract": "3D object detection from multiple image views is a fundamental and challenging task for visual scene understanding. Owing to its low cost and high efficiency, multi-view 3D object detection has demonstrated promising application prospects. However, accurately detecting objects through perspective views is extremely difficult due to the lack of depth information. Current approaches tend to adopt heavy backbones for image encoders, making them inapplicable for real-world deployment. Different from the images, LiDAR points are superior in providing spatial cues, resulting in highly precise localization. In this paper, we explore the incorporation of LiDAR-based detectors for multi-view 3D object detection. Instead of directly training a depth prediction network, we unify the image and LiDAR features in the Bird-Eye-View (BEV) space and adaptively transfer knowledge across non-homogenous representations in a teacher-student paradigm. To this end, we propose BEVDistill, a cross-modal BEV knowledge distillation (KD) framework for multi-view 3D object detection. \nExtensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms current KD approaches on a highly-competitive baseline, BEVFormer, without introducing any extra cost in the inference phase. Notably, our best model achieves 59.4 NDS on the nuScenes test leaderboard, achieving new state-of-the-arts in comparison with various image-based detectors.

We propose a Symbolic-Neural model that can learn to explicitly predict class labels of text spans from a constituency tree without requiring any access to span-level gold labels. As the structured language model learns to predict constituency trees in a self-supervised manner, only raw texts and sentence-level labels are required as training data, which makes it essentially a general constituent-level self-interpretable classification model. Our experiments demonstrate that our approach could achieve good prediction accuracy in downstream tasks.

    "title": "Suppressing the Heterogeneity: A Strong Feature Extractor for Few-shot Segmentation",
    "abstract": "This paper tackles the Few-shot Semantic Segmentation (FSS) task with focus on learning the feature extractor. Somehow the feature extractor has been overlooked by recent state-of-the-art methods, which directly use a deep model pretrained on ImageNet for feature extraction (without further fine-tuning). Under this background, we think the FSS feature extractor deserves exploration and observe the heterogeneity (i.e., the intra-class diversity in the raw images) as a critical challenge hindering the intra-class feature compactness. The heterogeneity has three levels from coarse to fine: 1) Sample-level: the inevitable distribution gap between the support and query images makes them heterogeneous from each other. 2) Region-level: the background in FSS actually contains multiple regions with different semantics. 3) Patch-level: some neighboring patches belonging to a same class may appear quite different from each other. Motivated by these observations, we propose a feature extractor with Multi-level Heterogeneity Suppressing (MuHS). MuHS leverages the attention mechanism in transformer backbone to effectively suppress all these three-level heterogeneity. Concretely, MuHS reinforces the attention / interaction between different samples (query and support), different regions and neighboring patches by constructing cross-sample attention, cross-region interaction and a novel masked image segmentation (inspired by the recent masked image modeling), respectively. We empirically show that 1) MuHS brings consistent improvement for various FSS heads and 2) using a simple linear classification head, MuHS sets new states of the art on multiple FSS datasets, validating the importance of FSS feature learning",

    "abstract": "Oriented object detection emerges in many applications from aerial images to autonomous driving, while many existing detection benchmarks are annotated with horizontal bounding box only which is also less costive than fine-grained rotated box, leading to a gap between the readily available training corpus and the rising demand for oriented object detection.  This paper proposes a simple yet effective oriented object detection approach called H2RBox merely using horizontal box annotation for weakly-supervised training, which closes the above gap and shows competitive performance even against those trained with rotated boxes.  The cores of our method are weakly- and self-supervised learning, which predicts the angle of the object by learning the consistency of two different views. To our best knowledge, H2RBox is the first horizontal box annotation-based oriented object detector. Compared to an alternative i.e. horizontal box-supervised instance segmentation with our post adaption to oriented object detection, our approach is not susceptible to the prediction quality of mask and can perform more robustly in complex scenes containing a large number of dense objects and outliers. Experimental results show that H2RBox has significant performance and speed advantages over horizontal box-supervised instance segmentation methods, as well as lower memory requirements. While compared to rotated box-supervised oriented object detectors, our method shows very close performance and speed.

We focus on low-rank Markov games whose transition matrix admits a hidden low-rank structure on top of an unknown non-linear representation. The goal is to design an algorithm that (1) finds an \nε\n-equilibrium policy sample efficiently without prior knowledge of the environment or the representation, and (2) permits a deep-learning friendly implementation. We leverage representation learning and present a model-based and a model-free approach to construct an effective representation from collected data. For both approaches, the algorithm achieves a sample complexity of poly\n(\nH\n,\nd\n,\nA\n,\n1\n/\nε\n)\n, where \nH\n is the game horizon, \nd\n is the dimension of the feature vector, \nA\n is the size of the joint action space and \nε\n is the optimality gap. When the number of players is large, the above sample complexity can scale exponentially with the number of players in the worst case. To address this challenge, we consider Markov Games with a factorized transition structure and present an algorithm that escapes such exponential scaling. To our best knowledge, this is the first sample-efficient algorithm for multi-agent general-sum Markov games that incorporates (non-linear) function approximation.

This paper shows that in such settings, selectively fine-tuning a subset of layers (which we term surgical fine-tuning) matches or outperforms commonly used fine-tuning approaches. Moreover, the type of distribution shift influences which subset is more effective to tune: for example, for image corruptions, fine-tuning only the first few layers works best. We validate our findings systematically across seven real-world data tasks spanning three types of distribution shifts. Theoretically, we prove that for two-layer neural networks in an idealized setting, first-layer tuning can outperform fine-tuning all layers.

In this paper, we propose an alternative direction, i.e., to efficiently leverage a pool of pretrained models without fine-tuning. Through extensive empirical and theoretical evidence, we demonstrate that (1) pretrained models have possessed generalization to some extent while there is no single best pretrained model across all distribution shifts, and (2) out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization error depends on the fitness between the pretrained model and unseen test distributions. This analysis motivates us to incorporate diverse pretrained models and to dispatch the best matched models for each OOD sample by means of recommendation techniques. To this end, we propose SIMPLE, a specialized model-sample matching method for domain generalization. First, the predictions of pretrained models are adapted to the target domain by a linear label space transformation. A matching network aware of model specialty is then proposed to dynamically recommend proper pretrained models to predict each test sample. The experiments on DomainBed show that our method achieves significant performance improvements (up to 12.2% for individual dataset and 3.9% on average) compared to state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods and further achieves 6.1% gain via enlarging the pretrained model pool. Moreover, our method is highly efficient and achieves more than 1000 times training speedup compared to the conventional DG methods with fine-tuning a pretrained model.

    "title": "Delving into Semantic Scale Imbalance",
    "abstract": "Model bias triggered by long-tailed data has been widely studied. However, measure based on the number of samples cannot explicate three phenomena simultaneously: (1) Given enough data, the classification performance gain is marginal with additional samples. (2) Classification performance decays precipitously as the number of training samples decreases when there is insufficient data. (3) Model trained on sample-balanced datasets still has different biases for different classes. In this work, we define and quantify the semantic scale of classes, which is equivalent to the feature diversity of classes. It is exciting to find experimentally that there is a marginal effect of semantic scale, which perfectly describes the first two phenomena. Further, the quantitative measurement of semantic scale imbalance is proposed, which can accurately reflect model bias on multiple datasets, even on sample-balanced data, revealing a novel perspective for the study of class imbalance. Due to the prevalence of semantic scale imbalance, we propose semantic-scale-balanced learning, including a general loss improvement scheme and a dynamic re-weighting training framework that overcomes the challenge of calculating semantic scales in real-time during iterations. Comprehensive experiments show that dynamic semantic-scale-balanced learning consistently enables the model to perform superiorly on large-scale long-tailed and non-long-tailed datasets, which is a good starting point for mitigating the prevalent but unnoticed model bias",

    "title": "Contextual Image Masking Modeling via Synergized Contrasting without View Augmentation for Faster and Better Visual Pretraining",
    "abstract": "We propose a new contextual masking image modeling (MIM) approach called contrasting-aided contextual MIM (ccMIM), under the MIM paradigm for visual pretraining. Specifically, we adopt importance sampling to select the masked patches with richer semantic information for reconstruction, instead of random sampling as done in previous MIM works. As such, the resulting patch reconstruction task from the remaining less semantic patches could be more difficult and helps to learn. To speed up the possibly slowed convergence due to our more difficult reconstruction task, we further propose a new contrastive loss that aligns the tokens of the vision transformer extracted from the selected masked patches and the remaining ones, respectively. The hope is that it serves as a regularizer for patch feature learning such that the image-level global information could be captured in both masked and unmasked patches, and notably such a single-view contrasting avoids the tedious image augmentation step required in recent efforts of introducing contrastive learning to MIM (to speedup convergence and discriminative ability). Meanwhile, the attention score from the contrastive global feature can also carry effective semantic clues to in turn guide our above masking patch selection scheme. In consequence, our contextual MIM and contrastive learning are synergetically performed in a loop (semantic patch selection-token alignment contrasting) to boost the best of the two worlds: fast convergence and strong performance on downstream tasks without ad-hoc augmentations, which are verified by empirical results on ImageNet-1K for both classification and dense vision tasks",

    "title": "Patch-Level Contrasting without Patch Correspondence for Accurate and Dense Contrastive Representation Learning",
    "abstract": "We propose ADCLR: \\underline{A}ccurate and \\underline{D}ense \\underline{C}ontrastive \\underline{R}epresentation \\underline{L}earning, a novel self-supervised learning framework for learning accurate and dense vision representation. To extract spatial-sensitive information, ADCLR introduces query patches for contrasting  in addition with global contrasting. Compared with previous dense contrasting methods, ADCLR mainly enjoys three merits: i) achieving both global-discriminative and spatial-sensitive representation, ii) model-efficient (no extra parameters in addition to the global contrasting baseline), and iii) correspondence-free and thus simpler to implement. Our approach achieves new state-of-the-art performance for contrastive methods. On classification tasks, for ViT-S, ADCLR achieves 78.1\\% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet with linear probing, outperforming our baseline (DINO) without our devised techniques as plug-in, by 1.1\\%. For ViT-B, ADCLR achieves 79.8\\%, 84.0\\% accuracy on ImageNet by linear probing and finetune, outperforming DINO by 0.6\\%, 0.4\\% accuracy. For dense tasks, on MS-COCO, ADCLR achieves significant improvements of 44.3\\% AP on object detection, 39.7\\% AP on instance segmentation, outperforming previous SOTA method SelfPatch by 2.2\\% and 1.2\\%, respectively. On ADE20K, ADCLR outperforms SelfPatch by 1.0\\% mIoU, 1.2\\% mAcc on the segmentation task",

    "title": "Continuous-Discrete Convolution for Geometry-Sequence Modeling in Proteins",
    "abstract": "The structure of proteins involves 3D geometry of amino acid coordinates and 1D sequence of peptide chains. The 3D structure exhibits irregularity because amino acids are distributed unevenly in Euclidean space and their coordinates are continuous variables. In contrast, the 1D structure is regular because amino acids are arranged uniformly in the chains and their sequential positions (orders) are discrete variables. Moreover, geometric coordinates and sequential orders are in two types of spaces and their units of length are incompatible. These inconsistencies make it challenging to capture the 3D and 1D structures while avoiding the impact of sequence and geometry modeling on each other. This paper proposes a Continuous-Discrete Convolution (CDConv) that uses irregular and regular approaches to model the geometry and sequence structures, respectively. Specifically, CDConv employs independent learnable weights for different regular sequential displacements but directly encodes geometric displacements due to their irregularity. In this way, CDConv significantly improves protein modeling by reducing the impact of geometric irregularity on sequence modeling. Extensive experiments on a range of tasks, including protein fold classification, enzyme reaction classification, gene ontology term prediction and enzyme commission number prediction, demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed CDConv",
