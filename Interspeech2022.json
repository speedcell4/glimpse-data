    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "In this paper, we present SANE-TTS, a stable and natural end-to-end multilingual TTS model. By the difficulty of obtaining multilingual corpus for given speaker, training multilingual TTS model with monolingual corpora is unavoidable. We introduce speaker regularization loss that improves speech naturalness during cross-lingual synthesis as well as domain adversarial training, which is applied in other multilingual TTS models. Furthermore, by adding speaker regularization loss, replacing speaker embedding with zero vector in duration predictor stabilizes cross-lingual inference. With this replacement, our model generates speeches with moderate rhythm regardless of source speaker in cross-lingual synthesis. In MOS evaluation, SANE-TTS achieves naturalness score above 3.80 both in cross-lingual and intralingual synthesis, where the ground truth score is 3.99. Also, SANE-TTS maintains speaker similarity close to that of ground truth even in cross-lingual inference. Audio samples are available on our web page",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "The recently developed pitch-controllable text-to-speech (TTS) model, i.e. FastPitch, was conditioned for the pitch contours. However, the quality of the synthesized speech degraded considerably for pitch values that deviated significantly from the average pitch; i.e. the ability to control vocal pitch was limited. To address this issue, we propose two algorithms to improve the robustness of FastPitch. First, we propose a novel timbre-preserving pitch-shifting algorithm for natural pitch augmentation. Pitch-shifted speech samples sound more natural when using the proposed algorithm because the speaker's vocal timbre is maintained. Moreover, we propose a training algorithm that defines FastPitch using pitch-augmented speech datasets with different pitch ranges for the same sentence. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithms improve the pitch controllability of FastPitch",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Since neural Text-To-Speech models have achieved such high standards in terms of naturalness, the main focus of the field has gradually shifted to gaining more control over the expressiveness of the synthetic voices. One of these leverages is the control of the speaking rate that has become harder for a human operator to control since the introduction of neural attention networks to model speech dynamics. While numerous models have reintroduced an explicit duration control (ex: FastSpeech2), these models generally rely on additional tasks to complete during their training. In this paper, we show how an acoustic analysis of the internal embeddings delivered by the encoder of an unsupervised end-to-end TTS Tacotron2 model is enough to identify and control some acoustic parameters of interest. Specifically, we compare this speaking rate control with the duration control offered by a supervised FastSpeech2 model. Experimental results show that the control provided by embeddings reproduces a behaviour closer to natural speech data",

    "abstract": "Three research directions that have recently advanced the text-to-speech (TTS) field are end-to-end architecture, prosody control modeling, and on-the-fly duration alignment of non-auto-regressive models. However, these three agendas have yet to be tackled at once in a single solution. Current studies are limited either by a lack of control over prosody modeling or by the inefficient training inherent in building a two-stage TTS pipeline. We propose TriniTTS, a pitch-controllable end-to-end TTS without an external aligner that generates natural speech by addressing the issues mentioned above at once. It eliminates the training inefficiency in the two-stage TTS pipeline by the end-to-end architecture. Moreover, it manages to learn the latent vector representing the data distribution of the speeches through performing tasks (alignment search, pitch estimation, waveform generation) simultaneously. Experimental results demonstrate that TriniTTS enables prosody modeling with user input parameters to generate deterministic speech, while synthesizing comparable speech to the state-of-the-art VITS. Furthermore, eliminating normalizing flow modules used in VITS increases the inference speed by 28.84% in CPU environment and by 29.16% in GPU environment",

For example, FastSpeech2 transforms an input text to a mel-spectrogram and then HiFi-GAN generates a raw waveform from a mel-spectogram where they are called an acoustic feature generator and a neural vocoder respectively. However, their training pipeline is somewhat cumbersome in that it requires a fine-tuning and an accurate speech-text alignment for optimal performance. In this work, we present end-to-end text-to-speech (E2E-TTS) model which has a simplified training pipeline and outperforms a cascade of separately learned models. Specifically, our proposed model is jointly trained FastSpeech2 and HiFi-GAN with an alignment module. Since there is no acoustic feature mismatch between training and inference, it does not requires fine-tuning. Furthermore, we remove dependency on an external speech-text alignment tool by adopting an alignment learning objective in our joint training framework.

We focus on Speaker Adaptation (SA) in command speech recognition, where data from multiple sources (i.e., multiple speakers) are available. Specifically, we propose an unsupervised Multi-Source Domain Adaptation (MSDA) algorithm based on optimal-transport, called MSDA via Weighted Joint Optimal Transport (MSDA-WJDOT). We achieve a Command Error Rate relative reduction of 16% and 7% over the speaker-independent model and the best competitor method, respectively. The strength of the proposed approach is that, differently from any other existing SA method, it offers an interpretable model that can also be exploited, in this context, to diagnose dysarthria without any specific training. Indeed, it provides a closeness measure between the target and the source speakers, reflecting their similarity in terms of speech characteristics. Based on the similarity between the target speaker and the healthy/dysarthric source speakers, we then define the healthy/dysarthric score of the target speaker that we leverage to perform dysarthria detection. This approach does not require any additional training and achieves a 95% accuracy in the dysarthria diagnosis",

    "abstract": "Raw waveform acoustic modelling has recently received increasing attention. Compared with the task-blind hand-crafted features which may discard useful information, representations directly learned from the raw waveform are task-specific and potentially include all task-relevant information. In the context of automatic dysarthric speech recognition (ADSR), raw waveform acoustic modelling is under-explored owing to data scarcity. Parametric convolutional neural networks (CNNs) can compensate for this problem due to having notably fewer parameters and requiring less training data in comparison with conventional non-parametric CNNs. In this paper, we explore the usefulness of raw waveform acoustic modelling using various parametric CNNs for ADSR. We investigate the properties of the learned filters and monitor the training dynamics of various models. Furthermore, we study the effectiveness of data augmentation and multi-stream acoustic modelling through combining the non-parametric and parametric CNNs fed by hand-crafted and raw waveform features. Experimental results on the TORGO dysarthric database show that the parametric CNNs significantly outperform the non-parametric CNNs, reaching up to 36.2% and 12.6% WERs (up to 3.4% and 1.1% absolute error reduction) for dysarthric and typical speech, respectively. Multi-stream acoustic modelling further improves the performance resulting in up to 33.2% and 10.3% WERs for dysarthric and typical speech, respectively",

A proven solution to this problem is by first pretraining the model on a huge number of healthy speech datasets and then fine-tuning it on the pathological speech datasets. One new pretraining framework called self-supervised learning (SSL) trains a network using only speech data, providing more flexibility in training data requirements and allowing more speech data to be used in pretraining. We investigate SSL frameworks such as the wav2vec 2.0 and WavLM models using different setups and compare their performance with different supervised pretraining setups, using two types of pathological speech, namely, Japanese electrolaryngeal and English dysarthric. Our results show that although SSL has shown success with minimally resourced healthy speech, we do not find this to be the case with pathological speech.

Deep Autoencoder (DAE)-based healthy speech modification and various perturbations comprise static augmentations, whereas SpecAugment techniques modified to specifically augment dysarthric speech comprise the dynamic data augmentation. The objective of this work is to improve the ASR performance for dysarthric speech using the two-stage data augmentation scheme. An end-to-end ASR using a Transformer acoustic model is used to evaluate the data augmentation scheme on speech from the UA dysarthric speech corpus.

The current study explores the usefulness of using Wav2Vec self-supervised speech representations as features for training an ASR system for dysarthric speech. Dysarthric speech recognition is particularly difficult as several aspects of speech such as articulation, prosody and phonation can be impaired. Specifically, we train an acoustic model with features extracted from Wav2Vec, Hubert, and the cross-lingual XLSR model. Results suggest that speech representations pretrained on large unlabelled data can improve word error rate (WER) performance. In particular, features from the multilingual model led to lower WERs than Fbanks or models trained on a single language. Improvements were seen in English speakers with cerebral palsy caused dysarthria (UASpeech corpus), Spanish speakers with Parkinsonian dysarthria (PC-GITA corpus) and Italian speakers with paralysis-based dysarthria (EasyCall corpus).

Numerous types of neural network-based AMs have been studied, but the structure that has received the most attention in recent years is the Transformer. In this study, we demonstrate that the Transformer model is more vulnerable to input sparsity compared to the convolutional neural network (CNN) and analyze the cause of performance degradation through structural characteristics of the Transformer. Moreover, we also propose a novel regularization method that makes the transformer model robust against input sparsity. The proposed sparsity regularization method directly regulates attention weights using silence label information in forced-alignment and has the advantage of not requiring additional module training and excessive computation. We tested the proposed method on five benchmarks and observed an average relative error rate reduction (RERR) of 4.7%",

When humans learn to speak, they first try to utter basic phones and then gradually move towards more complex structures such as words and sentences. This methodology is known as Curriculum Learning, and we employ it in the context of Automatic Speech Recognition. We hypothesize that end-to-end models can achieve better performance when provided with an organized training set consisting of examples that exhibit an increasing level of difficulty (i.e. a curriculum). To impose structure on the training set and to define the notion of an easy example, we explored multiple scoring functions that either use feedback from an external neural network or incorporate feedback from the model itself.

We want to show that this change fits in with prosodic change: specifically, the grammaticalised item undergoes prosodic reduction. We test the latter hypothesis on the peculiar Italo-Romance dialect Gazzolese, where mia, the particle undergoing JC, can be used both as the erstwhile contrastive function and as a function word denoting negation (it can appear, for example, in Broad Focus statements). The results confirm that when mia is used as a function word, it displays a shorter duration, a reduced intensity excursion, and does not associate with a pitch accent, in comparison to the original contrastive context.

Results indicate that quantifiable VLMs observed for each sentence range from 3 to 6 movements, with 4 movements per sentence being the most frequent. Sentences with focus have more instances of VLM per sentence than those without.

In the present study, we investigate f0 variability over the course of a telephone conversation, with a focus on the initial and medial utterances within the exchange. We examined f0 standard deviation of each utterance in over 2000 telephone conversations from 509 American English speakers from the Switchboard corpus. Findings showed that on average, speakers exhibit more f0 variability in the opening compared to mid-conversation utterances. Further, findings suggest that the inclusion of a greeting word in an initial turn, e.g., \"hello\" or \"hi\", corresponds to an increase in f0 standard deviation. These results suggest that speakers employed more variable f0 in the initial few turns of a telephone conversation. The interpretation of this finding is multifaceted and may be linked to several communicative goals, including the placement of identity markers in conversation or the attraction of attention, or the role of openings as boundary markers",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Speech translation models are unable to directly process long audios, like TED talks, which have to be split into shorter segments. Speech translation datasets provide manual segmentations of the audios, which are not available in real-world scenarios, and existing segmentation methods usually significantly reduce translation quality at inference time. To bridge the gap between the manual segmentation of training and the automatic one at inference, we propose Supervised Hybrid Audio Segmentation (SHAS), a method that can effectively learn the optimal segmentation from any manually segmented speech corpus. First, we train a classifier to identify the included frames in a segmentation, using speech representations from a pre-trained wav2vec 2.0. The optimal splitting points are then found by a probabilistic Divide-and-Conquer algorithm that progressively splits at the frame of lowest probability until all segments are below a pre-specified length. Experiments on MuST-C and mTEDx show that the translation of the segments produced by our method approaches the quality of the manual segmentation on 5 languages pairs. Namely, SHAS retains 95-98% of the manual segmentation's BLEU score, compared to the 87-93% of the best existing methods. Our method is additionally generalizable to different domains and achieves high zero-shot performance in unseen languages",

    "abstract": "End-to-end speech-to-text translation models are often initialized with pre-trained speech encoder and pre-trained text decoder. This leads to a significant training gap between pre-training and fine-tuning, largely due to the modality differences between speech outputs from the encoder and text inputs to the decoder. In this work, we aim to bridge the modality gap between speech and text to improve translation quality. We propose M-Adapter, a novel Transformer-based module, to adapt speech representations to text. While shrinking the speech sequence, M-Adapter produces features desired for speech-to-text translation via modelling global and local dependencies of a speech sequence.

These systems need to decide when to read more input and when to write the output.

Hence, read/write decision policy remains the same across different input modalities, i.e., speech and text. This motivates us to leverage the text transcripts corresponding to the speech input for improving simultaneous speech-to-text translation (SimulST). We propose Cross-Modal Decision Regularization (CMDR) to improve the decision policy of SimulST systems by using the simultaneous text-to-text translation (SimulMT) task. We also extend several techniques from the offline speech translation domain to explore the role of SimulMT task in improving SimulST performance.

Triplet loss is added to the Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) loss in the ASR while training.

In contrast, the Multi-View recurrent method that learns jointly on the text and acoustic embeddings achieves only 0.218 for out-of-vocabulary words. This method is also applied to low-resource languages such as Tamil by converting Tamil characters to English using transliteration. This is a very challenging novel task for which we provide a dataset of transcripts for the keywords.

    "abstract": "Since each of the currently available emotional speech corpora is rather small to deal with personal or cultural diversity, multiple emotional speech corpora can be jointly used to train a speech emotion recognition (SER) model robust to unseen corpora. Each corpus has different characteristics, including whether acted or spontaneous, in which environment it was recorded, and what lexical contents it contains. Depending on the characteristics, the emotion recognition accuracy and time required to train a model for it are different. If we train the SER model utilizing multiple corpora equally, the classification performance for each training corpus would be different. The performance for unseen corpora may be enhanced if the model is trained to show similar recognition accuracy for each training corpus that covers different characteristics. In this study, we propose to adopt corpus-wise weights in the classification loss, which are functions of the recognition accuracy for each of the training corpus. We also adopt pseudo-emotion labels for the unlabeled speech corpus to further enhance the performance.

To improve the attention area, we propose to use a Focus-Attention (FA) mechanism and a novel Calibration-Attention (CA) mechanism in combination with the multi-head self-attention. Through the FA mechanism, the network can detect the largest amplitude part in the segment. By employing the CA mechanism, the network can modulate the information flow by assigning different weights to each attention head and improve the utilization of surrounding contexts.

However, it is expensive and difficult to label the emotion of a sentence with confidence or multi-label. In this paper, we automatically construct a grayscale label considering the correlation between emotions and use it for learning. That is, instead of using a given label as a one-hot encoding, we construct a grayscale label by measuring scores for different emotions. We introduce several methods for constructing grayscale labels and confirm that each method improves the emotion recognition performance.

Valence predictions of the transformer model are very reactive to positive and negative sentiment content, as well as negations, but not to intensifiers or reducers, while none of those linguistic features impact arousal or dominance.

To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first to use Bayesian neural networks for speech emotion recognition. At training, the network learns a distribution of weights to capture the inherent uncertainty related to subjective arousal annotations. To this end, we introduce a loss term that enables the model to be explicitly trained on a distribution of annotations, rather than training them exclusively on mean or gold-standard labels.

Silence represents an important paralinguistic component in communication. For example, some of its functions include conveying emphasis, dramatization, or even sarcasm. In speech emotion recognition (SER), there has been relatively little work on investigating the utility of silence and no work regarding the effect of silence on linguistics. In this work, we present a novel framework which investigates fusing linguistic and silence representations for emotion recognition in naturalistic speech using the MSP-Podcast dataset. We investigate two methods to represent silence in SER models; the first approach uses utterance-level statistics, while the second learns a silence token embedding within a transformer language model. Our results show that modeling silence does improve SER performance and that modeling silence as a token in a transformer language model significantly improves performance on MSP-Podcast achieving a concordance correlation coefficient of .191 and .453 for activation and valence respectively. In addition, we perform analyses on the attention of silence and find that silence emphasizes the attention of its surrounding words",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Previous studies on speech emotion recognition (SER) with categorical emotions have often formulated the task as a single-label classification problem, where the emotions are considered orthogonal to each other. However, previous studies have indicated that emotions can co-occur, especially for more ambiguous emotional sentences (e.g., a mixture of happiness and surprise). Some studies have regarded SER problems as a multi-label task, predicting multiple emotional classes. However, this formulation does not leverage the relation between emotions during training, since emotions are assumed to be independent. This study explores the idea that emotional classes are not necessarily independent and its implications on training SER models. In particular, we calculate the frequency of co-occurring emotions from perceptual evaluations in the train set to generate a matrix with class-dependent penalties, punishing more mistakes between distant emotional classes. We integrate the penalization matrix into three existing label-learning approaches (hard-label, multi-label, and distribution-label learning) using the proposed modified loss. We train SER models using the penalty loss and commonly used cost functions for SER tasks. The evaluation of our proposed penalization matrix on the MSP-Podcast corpus shows important relative improvements in macro F1-score for hard-label learning (17.12%), multi-label learning (12.79%), and distribution-label learning (25.8%)",

We model the local cadence by using separate `positional encodings' for each modality in a transformer architecture. Our results show that emotion detection based on this strategy is better than when the modality specific cadence is ignored or normalized out by using a shared positional encoding. We also find that capturing the modality interdependence is not as important as is capturing of the local cadence of individual modalities.

    "abstract": "In most of practical scenarios, the announcement system must deliver speech messages in a noisy environment, in which the background noise cannot be cancelled out. The local noise reduces speech intelligibility and increases listening effort of the listener, hence hamper the effectiveness of announcement system. There has been reported that voices of professional announcers are clearer and more comprehensive than that of non-expert speakers in noisy environment. This finding suggests that the speech intelligibility might be related to the speaking style of professional announcer, which can be adapted using voice conversion method. Motivated by this idea, this paper proposes a speech intelligibility enhancement in noisy environment by applying voice conversion method on non-professional voice. We discovered that the professional announcers and non-professional speakers are clusterized into different clusters on the speaker embedding plane. This implies that the speech intelligibility can be controlled as an independent feature of speaker individuality. To examine the advantage of converted voice in noisy environment, we experimented using test words masked in pink noise at different SNR levels. The results of objective and subjective evaluations confirm that the speech intelligibility of converted voice is higher than that of original voice in low SNR conditions",

To alleviate this problem, this paper proposes a phase-aware speech enhancement method by estimating the magnitude and phase of a complex adaptive Wiener filter. In this method, a noise-robust vector-quantized variational autoencoder is utilized for estimating the magnitude Wiener filter by using the Itakura-Saito divergence on time-frequency domain, while the phase of the Wiener filter is estimated by a convolutional recurrent network using the scale-invariant signal-to-noise ratio constraint in the time domain. The proposed method was evaluated on the open Voice Bank+DEMAND dataset to provide a direct comparison with other speech enhancement studies and achieved the PESQ score of 2.85 and STOI score of 0.94, which is better than the state-of-art method based on cIRM estimation in the 2020 Deep Noise Challenge",

We further study the relationship between the noise robustness of SSL representation via clean-noisy distance (CN distance) and the layer importance for SE. Consequently, we found that SSL representations with lower noise robustness are more important. Furthermore, our experiments on the VCTK-DEMAND dataset demonstrated that fine-tuning an SSL representation with an SE model can outperform the SOTA SSL-based SE methods in PESQ, CSIG and COVL without invoking complicated network architectures.

    "abstract": "Deep learning has been widely adopted for speech applications. Many studies have shown that using the multiple objective framework and learned deep features is effective for improving system performance. In this paper, we propose a perceptual characteristics based multi-objective speech enhancement (SE) algorithm that combines the conventional loss and objective losses of pitch and timbre related features. Timbre related features include frequency modulation (encoded by the pitch contour), amplitude modulation (encoded by the energy contour), and speaker identity. For the speaker identity loss, we consider the deep features derived in a speaker identification system. The proposed algorithm consists of two parts, a LSTM based SE model and CNN based multi-objective models. The objective losses are derived between speech enhanced by the SE model and clean speech and combined with the SE loss for updating the SE model. The proposed algorithm is evaluated using the corpus of Taiwan Mandarin hearing in noise test (TMHINT). Experimental results show the proposed algorithm evidently outperforms the original SE model in all objective scores, including speech quality, speech intelligibility and signal distortion",

    "abstract": "Target speech extraction (TSE) extracts the speech of a target speaker in a mixture given auxiliary clues characterizing the speaker, such as an enrollment utterance. TSE addresses thus the challenging problem of simultaneously performing separation and speaker identification. There has been much progress in extraction performance following the recent development of neural networks for speech enhancement and separation. Most studies have focused on processing mixtures where the target speaker is actively speaking. However, the target speaker is sometimes silent in practice, i.e., inactive speaker (IS). A typical TSE system will tend to output a signal in IS cases, causing false alarms. This is a severe problem for the practical deployment of TSE systems. This paper aims at understanding better how well TSE systems can handle IS cases. We consider two approaches to deal with IS, (1) training a system to directly output zero signals or (2) detecting IS with an extra speaker verification module. We perform an extensive experimental comparison of these schemes in terms of extraction performance and IS detection using the LibriMix dataset and reveal their pros and cons",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Many state-of-the-art speech enhancement (SE) systems have recently used convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to extract multi-scale feature maps. However, CNN relies more on local texture than global shape, which is more susceptible to degraded spectrogram and may fail to capture the detailed structure of speech. Although some two-stage systems feed the first-stage enhanced and original noisy spectrograms to the second stage simultaneously, this does not guarantee sufficient guidance for the second stage since the first-stage spectrogram can not provide precise spectral details. In order to allow CNNs to perceive clear speech component boundary information, we compose feature maps with spectrograms containing evident speech components according to the mask value from the first stage. The positions corresponding to the mask greater than certain thresholds are extracted as feature maps. These feature maps make the boundary information of speech components obvious by ignoring others, thus making CNNs sensitive to input features. Experiments on the VB dataset show that with a proper decomposition numbers, the proposed method can enhance SE performance, which can provide 0.15 PESQ improvement. Besides, the proposed method is more effective for spectral detail recovery",

The presented framework allows for robust dereverberation on a single-channel noisy reverberant dataset similar to WHAMR!. The Kalman filtering WPE introduces distortions in the enhanced signal when predicting the filter variations from the residual error only, if the target speech power spectral density is not perfectly known and the observation is noisy. The proposed approach avoids these distortions by correcting the filter variations estimation in a data-driven way, increasing the robustness of the method to noisy scenarios. Furthermore, it yields a strong dereverberation and denoising performance compared to a DNN-supported recursive least squares variant of WPE, especially for highly noisy inputs",

We evaluate our proposed method on synthetic and recorded (LibriCSS) mixtures. We find that the spatial loss is most effective to train IVA-based separators.

The signal coarsely separated by blind source separation (BSS) has been used for training neural separators in an unsupervised manner. However, the performance is limited due to distortions in the supervision. In contrast, remix-cycle-consistent learning (RCCL) enables a separator to be trained on distortion-free observed mixtures by making the remixed mixtures obtained by repeatedly separating and remixing the two different mixtures closer to the original mixtures. Still, training with RCCL from scratch often falls into a trivial solution, i.e., not separating signals. The present study provides a novel unsupervised learning algorithm for the Seq-BF with two stacked neural separators, in which the separators are pre-trained using the BSS outputs and then fine-tuned with RCCL. Such configuration compensates for the shortcomings of both approaches: the guiding mechanism in Seq-BF accelerates separation to exceed BSS performance, thereby stabilizing RCCL. Experimental comparisons demonstrated that the proposed unsupervised learning achieved performance comparable to supervised learning (0.4 point difference in word error rate)",

Next, we further extend the time-dependent SCM by incorporating a newly proposed NTF model of the spatial features, thereby introducing spatial components. To exploit the relationship between the positions of sound sources in adjacent time frames, resulting from the naturally occurring continuity of the movement itself, we impose local smoothness on time-dependent components of the spatial features.

It is well known that artifacts introduced from pre-processing with no overlapping speech can be detrimental to recognition performance. This work proposes a finite-state based generative method trained on timing information in speech corpora, which leads to two main contributions. First, a method for generating arbitrary large datasets which follow desired statistics of real parties. Second, features extracted from the models are shown to have a correlation with speaker extraction performance. This leads to the contribution of quantifying how much difficulty in a mixture is due to turn-taking, factoring out other complexities in the signal.

Traditional feature fusion is often implemented via simple operations, such as element-wise addition or concatenation.

MFA-Conformer significantly outperforms the popular ECAPA-TDNN systems in both recognition performance and inference speed.

However, when the uttering voice is disturbed by another interfering speaker's voice, the speaker verification system usually cannot selectively extract only the target speaker's information. Some works have been done by introducing a speech separation network to separate the target speaker's speech in advance. However, adding a speech separation network for speaker verification task could be redundant. Here, we proposed enroll-aware attentive statistic pooling (EA-ASP) layer to help the speaker verification system extract specific speaker's information.

The aggregated representation encodes the geometric structure of the underlying feature distribution, which is expected to contain valuable speaker-specific information that may not be represented by the commonly used statistical measures like mean and variance.

    "abstract": "Recently, attention mechanisms have been applied successfully in neural network-based speaker verification systems. Incorporating the Squeeze-and-Excitation block into convolutional neural networks has achieved remarkable performance. However, it uses global average pooling (GAP) to simply average the features along time and frequency dimensions, which is incapable of preserving sufficient speaker information in the feature maps. In this study, we show that GAP is a special case of a discrete cosine transform (DCT) on time-frequency domain mathematically using only the lowest frequency component in frequency decomposition. To strengthen the speaker information extraction ability, we propose to utilize multi-frequency information and design two novel and effective attention modules, called Single-Frequency Single-Channel (SFSC) attention module and Multi-Frequency Single-Channel (MFSC) attention module. The proposed attention modules can effectively capture more speaker information from multiple frequency components on the basis of DCT. We conduct comprehensive experiments on the VoxCeleb datasets and a probe evaluation on the 1st 48-UTD forensic corpus. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed SFSC and MFSC attention modules can efficiently generate more discriminative speaker representations and outperform ResNet34-SE and ECAPA-TDNN systems with relative 20.9% and 20.2% reduction in EER, without adding extra network parameters",

    "abstract": "In spite of the impressive success of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in speaker recognition, our understanding to CNNs' internal functions is still limited. A major obstacle is that some popular visualization tools are difficult to apply, for example those producing saliency maps. The reason is that speaker information does not show clear spatial patterns in the temporal-frequency space, which makes it hard to interpret the visualization results, and hence hard to confirm the reliability of a visualization tool. In this paper, we conduct an extensive analysis on three popular visualization methods based on class activation map(CAM): Grad-CAM, Score-CAM and Layer-CAM, to investigate their reliability for speaker recognition tasks. Experiments conducted on a state-of-the-art ResNet34SE model show that the Layer-CAM algorithm can produce reliable visualization, and thus can be used as a promising tool to explain CNN-based speaker models.

    "abstract": "State-of-art speaker verification (SV) systems use a back-end model to score the similarity of speaker embeddings extracted from a neural network. The commonly used back-ends are the cosine scoring and the probabilistic linear discriminant analysis (PLDA) scoring. With the recently developed neural embeddings, the theoretically more appealing PLDA approach is found to have no advantage against or even be inferior to the simple cosine scoring in terms of verification performance. This paper presents an investigation on the relation between the two back-ends, aiming to explain the above counter-intuitive observation. It is shown that the cosine scoring is essentially a special case of PLDA scoring. In other words, by properly setting the parameters of PLDA, the two back-ends become equivalent. As a consequence, the cosine scoring not only inherits the basic assumptions for the PLDA but also introduces additional assumptions on speaker embeddings. Experiments show that the dimensional independence assumption required by the cosine scoring contributes most to the performance gap between the two methods under the domain-matched condition. When there is severe domain mismatch, the dimensional independence assumption does not hold and the PLDA would perform better than the cosine for domain adaptation",

Attention-based pooling layers have been widely used to aggregate a sequence of frame-level feature vectors into an utterance-level speaker embedding.

However, it is still a challenging problem to make a good trade off between performance and model complexity for convolution attention models, especially for speaker recognition systems on low-resource edge computing nodes (smartphone, embedded devices, etc.).

However, most works treat speech signal as a whole, leading to the neglect of the pronunciation structure that is unique to speech and reflects the cognitive process. Meanwhile, Transformer has heavy computational burden due to its full attention operation. In this paper, a hierarchical efficient framework, called SpeechFormer, which considers the structural characteristics of speech, is proposed and can be served as a general-purpose backbone for cognitive speech signal processing. The proposed SpeechFormer consists of frame, phoneme, word and utterance stages in succession, each performing a neighboring attention according to the structural pattern of speech with high computational efficiency. SpeechFormer is evaluated on speech emotion recognition (IEMOCAP & MELD) and neurocognitive disorder detection (Pitt & DAIC-WOZ) tasks, and the results show that SpeechFormer outperforms the standard Transformer-based framework while greatly reducing the computational cost.

However, due to the increase in noise interference, the generalization ability declines when the traditional features (e.g., raw waveforms and MFCCs) are fed directly to the statistical model to estimate a single fullband gSNR. In this paper, we propose a multi-subband-based gSNR estimation network (MSGNet). Specifically, we split the noisy speech waveforms into Bark-scale subbands to obtain higher resolution signals to the middle and low frequencies. Then, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are used to learn a non-linear function to estimate the speech and noise energy ratio of each subband from the input muti-subband features. Finally, by integrating subbands with different speech and noise energies, gSNR in the fullband is calculated. Extensive experimental results on the AURORA-2J dataset demonstrate that the proposed MSGNet significantly reduces the mean absolute error compared to other baseline gSNR estimation methods",

    "abstract": "Structuring the latent space in probabilistic deep generative models, e.g., variational autoencoders (VAEs), is important to yield more expressive models and interpretable representations, and to avoid overfitting. One way to achieve this objective is to impose a sparsity constraint on the latent variables, e.g., via a Laplace prior. However, such approaches usually complicate the training phase, and they sacrifice the reconstruction quality to promote sparsity. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective methodology to structure the latent space via a sparsity-promoting dictionary model, which assumes that each latent code can be written as a sparse linear combination of a dictionary's columns. In particular, we leverage a computationally efficient and tuning-free method, which relies on a zero-mean Gaussian latent prior with learnable variances. We derive a variational inference scheme to train the model. Experiments on speech generative modeling demonstrate the advantage of the proposed approach over competing techniques, since it promotes sparsity while not deteriorating the output speech quality",

The basic idea of DTTRN is to learn a corpus invariant deep neural network to bridge the source and target speech samples and their label information. Following this idea, we make use of a transductive learning way to enforce a deep regressor to build the relationship between the features and emotional labels jointly in both speech corpora. Meanwhile, we also design an emotion guided regularization term for learning DTTRN by aligning source and target speech samples feature distributions from three different scales. Thus, the DTTRN only absorbing the label information provided by source speech samples is able to correctly predict the emotions of the target ones. To evaluate DTTRN, we conduct extensive cross-corpus SER experiments on EmoDB, CASIA, and eNTERFACE corpora.

In addition, ASP allows a direct interface with an analog microphone without a power-hungry analog-to-digital converter. Here, we present power-efficient analog acoustic features (PEAF) that are validated by fabricated CMOS chips for running audio recognition.

A novel theoretical framework based on information theory is established to analyze the information flow in each individual stage of the feature extraction pipeline.

Since the affective content of speech is inherently modulated by an individual's physical and mental state, a substantial body of research has been devoted to the study of paralinguistic correlates of stress-inducing task load. Historically, voice stress analysis (VSA) has been conducted using conventional digital signal processing (DSP) techniques. Despite the development of modern methods based on deep neural networks (DNNs), accurately detecting stress in speech remains difficult due to the wide variety of stressors and considerable variability in the individual stress perception. To that end, we introduce a set of five datasets for task load detection in speech. The voice recordings were collected as either cognitive or physical stress was induced in the cohort of volunteers, with a cumulative number of more than a hundred speakers. We used the datasets to design and evaluate a novel self-supervised audio representation that leverages the effectiveness of handcrafted features (DSP-based) and the complexity of data-driven DNN representations.

The first one explores \"learnable frontends'', i.e., neural modules that produce a learnable time-frequency representation, to overcome limitations of fixed features. The second one uses self-supervised learning to leverage unprecedented scales of pre-training data. In this work, we study the feasibility of combining both approaches, i.e., pre-training learnable frontend jointly with the main architecture for downstream classification. First, we show that pretraining two previously proposed frontends (SincNet and LEAF) on Audioset drastically improves linear-probe performance over fixed mel-filterbanks, suggesting that learnable time-frequency representations can benefit self-supervised pre-training even more than supervised training. Surprisingly, randomly initialized learnable filterbanks outperform mel-scaled initialization in the self-supervised setting, a counter-intuitive result that questions the appropriateness of strong priors when designing learnable filters. Through exploratory analysis of the learned frontend components, we uncover crucial differences in properties of these frontends when used in a supervised and self-supervised setting, especially the affinity of self-supervised filters to diverge significantly from the mel-scale to model a broader range of frequencies",

Although high estimation accuracy has been achieved for clean speech, it is still challenging for F0 estimation to handle noisy speech, mainly because of the corruption of harmonic structure caused by noise. In this paper, we view F0 estimation as a multi-class classification problem and train a frequency-domain densely-connected convolutional neural network (DC-CRN) to estimate F0 from noisy speech. The proposed model significantly outperforms baseline methods in terms of detection rate. We find that using complex short-time Fourier transform (STFT) as input produces better performance compared to using magnitude STFT as input. Furthermore, we explore improving F0 estimation with speech enhancement. Although the F0 estimation model trained on clean speech performs well on enhanced speech, the distortion introduced by the speech enhancement model limits the estimation performance. We propose a cascade model which consists of two modules that optimize enhanced speech and estimated F0 in turn.

Deep neural network based non-intrusive MOS estimation models have recently emerged as a popular cost-efficient alternative to these tests. These models are trained with only the MOS labels, often discarding the secondary statistics of the opinion scores. In this paper, we investigate several ways to integrate the distribution of opinion scores (e.g. variance, histogram information) to improve the MOS estimation performance. Our model is trained on a corpus of 419K denoised samples by 320 different DNS models and model variations and evaluated on 18K test samples from DNSMOS. We show that with very minor modification of a single task MOS estimation pipeline, these freely available labels can provide up to a 0.016 RMSE and 1% SRCC improvement",

    "title": "Deep versus Wide: An Analysis of Student Architectures for Task-Agnostic Knowledge Distillation of Self-Supervised Speech Models",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Self-supervised learning (SSL) is seen as a very promising approach with high performance for several speech downstream tasks. Since the parameters of SSL models are generally so large that training and inference require a lot of memory and computational cost, it is desirable to produce compact SSL models without a significant performance degradation by applying compression methods such as knowledge distillation (KD). Although the KD approach is able to shrink the depth and/or width of SSL model structures, there has been little research on how varying the depth and width impacts the internal representation of the small-footprint model. This paper provides an empirical study that addresses the question. We investigate the performance on SUPERB while varying the structure and KD methods so as to keep the number of parameters constant; this allows us to analyze the contribution of the representation introduced by varying the model architecture. Experiments demonstrate that a certain depth is essential for solving content-oriented tasks (e.g. automatic speech recognition) accurately, whereas a certain width is necessary for achieving high performance on several speaker-oriented tasks (e.g. speaker identification). Based on these observations, we identify, for SUPERB, a more compressed model with better performance than previous studies",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "The performance of neural anti-spoofing models has rapidly improved in recent years due to larger network architectures and better training methodologies. However, these systems require considerable training data for achieving high performance, which makes it challenging to train them in compute-restricted environments. To make these systems accessible in resource-constrained environments, we consider the task of training neural anti-spoofing models with limited training data. We apply multiple dataset pruning techniques to the ASVspoof 2019 dataset for selecting the most informative training examples and pruning a significant chunk of the data with minimal decrease in performance. We find that the existing pruning metrics are not simultaneously granular and stable. To address this problem and further improve the performance of anti-spoofing models on pruned data, we propose a new metric, Forgetting Norm, to score individual training examples with higher granularity. Extensive experiments on two anti-spoofing models, AASIST-L and RawNet2, and several pruning settings demonstrate up to 23% relative improvement with forgetting norm over other baseline pruning heuristics. We also demonstrate the desirable properties of the proposed metric by analyzing the training landscape of the neural anti-spoofing models",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "For text-to-speech (TTS) synthesis, prosodic structure prediction (PSP) plays an important role in producing natural and intelligible speech. Although inter-utterance linguistic information can influence the speech interpretation of the target utterance, previous works on PSP mainly focus on utilizing intrautterance linguistic information of the current utterance only. This work proposes to use inter-utterance linguistic information to improve the performance of PSP. Multi-level contextual information, which includes both inter-utterance and intrautterance linguistic information, is extracted by a hierarchical encoder from character level, utterance level and discourse level of the input text. Then a multi-task learning (MTL) decoder predicts prosodic boundaries from multi-level contextual information. Objective evaluation results on two datasets show that our method achieves better F1 scores in predicting prosodic word (PW), prosodic phrase (PPH) and intonational phrase (IPH). It demonstrates the effectiveness of using multi-level contextual information for PSP. Subjective preference tests also indicate the naturalness of synthesized speeches are improved",

In this paper, we propose a Chinese polyphone BERT model to predict the pronunciations of Chinese polyphonic characters. Firstly, we create 741 new Chinese monophonic characters from 354 source Chinese polyphonic characters by pronunciation. Then we get a Chinese polyphone BERT by extending a pre-trained Chinese BERT with 741 new Chinese monophonic characters and adding a corresponding embedding layer for new tokens, which is initialized by the embeddings of source Chinese polyphonic characters. In this way, we can turn the polyphone disambiguation task into a pre-training task of the Chinese polyphone BERT. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model, and the polyphone BERT model obtain 2% (from 92.1% to 94.1%) improvement of average accuracy compared with the BERT-based classifier model, which is the prior state-of-the-art in polyphone disambiguation",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "End-to-end TTS requires a large amount of speech/text paired data to cover all necessary knowledge, particularly how to pronounce different words in diverse contexts, so that a neural model may learn such knowledge accordingly. But in real applications, such high demand of training data is hard to be satisfied and additional knowledge often needs to be injected manually. For example, to capture pronunciation knowledge on languages without regular orthography, a complicated grapheme-to-phoneme pipeline needs to be built based on a large structured pronunciation lexicon, leading to extra, sometimes high, costs to extend neural TTS to such languages. In this paper, we propose a framework to learn to automatically extract knowledge from unstructured external resources using a novel Token2Knowledge attention module. The framework is applied to build a TTS model named Neural Lexicon Reader that extracts pronunciations from raw lexicon texts in an end-to-end manner. Experiments show the proposed model significantly reduces pronunciation errors in low-resource, end-to-end Chinese TTS, and the lexicon-reading capability can be transferred to other languages with a smaller amount of data",

Pairwise comparison with monolingual models in these languages suggests that multilingual ByT5 models generally lower the phone error rate by jointly learning from a variety of languages. The pretrained model can further benefit low resource G2P through zero-shot prediction on unseen languages or provides pretrained weights for finetuning, which helps the model converge to a lower phone error rate than randomly initialized weights.

    "abstract": "Recently, leveraging BERT pre-training to improve the phoneme encoder in text to speech (TTS) has drawn increasing attention. However, the works apply pre-training with character-based units to enhance the TTS phoneme encoder, which is inconsistent with the TTS fine-tuning that takes phonemes as input. Pre-training only with phonemes as input can alleviate the input mismatch but lack the ability to model rich representations and sematic information due to limited phoneme vocabulary. In this paper, we propose Mixed-Phoneme BERT, a novel variant of the BERT model that uses mixed phoneme and sup-phoneme representations to enhance the learning capability. Specifically, we merge the adjacent phonemes into sup-phonemes and combine the phoneme sequence and the merged sup-phoneme sequence as the model input, which can enhance the model capacity to learn rich contextual representations. Experiment results demonstrate that our proposed Mixed-Phoneme BERT significantly improves the TTS performance with 0.30 CMOS gain compared with the FastSpeech 2 baseline.

A parallel end-to-end speech like VITS can generate the audio with high MOS comparable to ground truth and achieve low latency on GPU. However, the VITS still has high latency when synthesizing long utterances on CPUs. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a streaming method for the parallel speech synthesis model like VITS to synthesize with the long texts effectively on CPU. Our system has achieved human-like speech quality in both the non-streaming and streaming mode on the in-house Vietnamese evaluation set, while the synthesis speed of our system is approximately four times faster than that of the VITS in the non-streaming mode. Furthermore, the customer perceived latency of our system in streaming mode is 25 times faster than the VITS on computer CPU. Our system in non-streaming mode achieves a MOS of 4.43 compared to ground-truth with MOS 4.56; it also has high-quality speech with a MOS of 4.35 in streaming mode.

We explore both attention and recurrent neural nets to account for the fact that stimuli in a pair are not time aligned. To obtain a large training set we convert listeners' ratings from MUSHRA tests to values that reflect how often one stimulus in the pair was rated higher than the other.

This paper proposes SoundChoice, a novel G2P architecture that processes entire sentences rather than operating at the word level. The proposed architecture takes advantage of a weighted homograph loss (that improves disambiguation), exploits curriculum learning (that gradually switches from wordlevel to sentence-level G2P), and integrates word embeddings from BERT (for further performance improvement). Moreover, the model inherits the best practices in speech recognition, including multi-task learning with Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) and beam search with an embedded language model.

We hypothesize that the information about the speaker's facial muscle movements is expressed in the generated speech and can somehow be predicted from speech alone. To verify this, we devise a neural network model that predicts an AU sequence from the mel-spectrogram of input speech and train it using a large-scale audio-visual dataset consisting of many speaking face-tracks. We call our method and model ``crossmodal AU sequence estimation/estimator (CAUSE)''. We implemented several of the most basic architectures for CAUSE, and quantitatively confirmed that the fully convolutional architecture performed best. Furthermore, by combining CAUSE with an AU-conditioned image-to-image translation method, we implemented a system that animates a given still face image from speech.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "With the recent developments in speech synthesis via machine learning, this study explores incorporating linguistics knowledge to visualise and evaluate synthetic speech model training. If changes to the first and second formant (in turn, the vowel space) can be seen and heard in synthetic speech, this knowledge can inform speech synthesis technology developers. A speech synthesis model trained on a large General American English database was fine-tuned into a New Zealand English voice to identify if the changes in the vowel space of synthetic speech could be seen and heard. The vowel spaces at different intervals during the fine-tuning were analysed to determine if the model learned the New Zealand English vowel space. Our findings based on vowel space analysis show that we can visualise how a speech synthesis model learns the vowel space of the database it is trained on. Perception tests confirmed that humans could perceive when a speech synthesis model has learned characteristics of the speech database it is training on. Using the vowel space as an intermediary evaluation helps understand what sounds are to be added to the training database and build speech synthesis models based on linguistics knowledge",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Deep neural networks have significantly improved performance on a range of tasks with the increasing demand for computational resources, leaving deployment on low-resource devices (with limited memory and battery power) infeasible. Binary neural networks (BNNs) tackle the issue to an extent with extreme compression and speed-up gains compared to real-valued models. We propose a simple but effective method to accelerate inference through unifying BNNs with an early-exiting strategy. Our approach allows simple instances to exit early based on a decision threshold and utilizes output layers added to different intermediate layers to avoid executing the entire binary model. We extensively evaluate our method on three audio classification tasks and across four BNNs architectures. Our method demonstrates favorable quality-efficiency trade-offs while being controllable with an entropy-based threshold specified by the system user. It also results in better speed-ups (latency less than 6ms) with a single model based on existing BNN architectures without retraining for different efficiency levels. It also provides a straightforward way to estimate sample difficulty and better understanding of uncertainty around certain classes within the dataset",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "This paper presents a streaming speaker-attributed automatic speech recognition (SA-ASR) model that can recognize ``who spoke what'' with low latency even when multiple people are speaking simultaneously. Our model is based on token-level serialized output training (t-SOT) which was recently proposed to transcribe multi-talker speech in a streaming fashion. To further recognize speaker identities, we propose an encoder-decoder based speaker embedding extractor that can estimate a speaker representation for each recognized token not only from non-overlapping speech but also from overlapping speech. The proposed speaker embedding, named t-vector, is extracted synchronously with the t-SOT ASR model, enabling joint execution of speaker identification (SID) or speaker diarization (SD) with the multi-talker transcription with low latency. We evaluate the proposed model for a joint task of ASR and SID/SD by using LibriSpeechMix and LibriCSS corpora. The proposed model achieves substantially better accuracy than a prior streaming model and shows comparable or sometimes even superior results to the state-of-the-art offline SA-ASR model",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we investigate the semi-supervised joint training of text to speech (TTS) and automatic speech recognition (ASR), where a small amount of paired data and a large amount of unpaired text data are available. Conventional studies form a cycle called the TTS-ASR pipeline, where the multi-speaker TTS model synthesizes speech from text with a reference speech and the ASR model reconstructs the text from the synthesized speech, after which both models are trained with a cycle-consistency loss. However, the synthesized speech does not reflect the speaker characteristics of the reference speech and the synthesized speech becomes overly easy for the ASR model to recognize after training. This not only decreases the TTS model quality but also limits the ASR model improvement. To solve this problem, we propose improving the cycle-consistency-based training with a speaker consistency loss and step-wise optimization. The speaker consistency loss brings the speaker characteristics of the synthesized speech closer to that of the reference speech. In the step-wise optimization, we first freeze the parameter of the TTS model before both models are trained to avoid over-adaptation of the TTS model to the ASR model. Experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method",

In this paper, we propose Prototype-based Co-Adaptation with Transformer (Proto-CAT), a multi-modal generalized few-shot learning (GFSL) method for AVSR systems. In other words, Proto-CAT learns to recognize a novel class multi-modal object with few-shot training data, while maintaining its ability on those base closed-set categories. The main idea is to transform the prototypes (i.e., class centers) by incorporating cross-modality complementary information and calibrating cross-category semantic differences. In particular, Proto-CAT co-adapts the embeddings from audio-visual and category levels, so that it generalizes its predictions on all categories dynamically. Proto-CAT achieves state-of-the-art performance on various AVSR-GFSL benchmarks. The code is available at https://github.com/ZhangYikaii/Proto-CAT",

    "abstract": "Cross-device federated learning (FL) protects user privacy by collaboratively training a model on user devices, therefore eliminating the need for collecting, storing, and manually labeling user data. Previous works have considered cross-device FL for automatic speech recognition (ASR), however, there are a few important challenges that havenot been fully addressed. These include the lack of ground-truth ASR transcriptions, and the scarcity of compute resource and network bandwidth on edge devices. In this paper, we address these two challenges. First, we propose a federated learning system to support on-device ASR adaptation with full self-supervision, which uses self-labeling together with data augmentation and filtering techniques. The proposed system can improve a strong Emformer-Transducer based ASR model pretrained on out-of-domain data, using in-domain audios without any ground-truth transcriptions. Second, to reduce the training cost, we propose a self-restricted RNN Transducer (SR-RNN-T) loss, a new variant of alignment-restricted RNN-T that uses Viterbi forced-alignment from self-supervision. To further reduce the compute and network cost, we systematically explore adapting only a subset of weights in the Emformer-Transducer. Our best training recipe achieves a 12.9% relative WER reduction over the strong out-of-domain baseline, which equals 70% of the reduction achievable with full human supervision and centralized training",

It converts numbers, dates, abbreviations, and other semiotic classes from the spoken form generated by ASR to their written forms. One can consider ITN as a Machine Translation task and use neural sequence-to-sequence models to solve it. Unfortunately, such neural models are prone to hallucinations that could lead to unacceptable errors. To mitigate this issue, we propose a single-pass token classifier model that regards ITN as a tagging task. The model assigns a replacement fragment to every input token or marks it for deletion or copying without changes. We present a method of dataset preparation, based on granular alignment of ITN examples. The proposed model is less prone to hallucination errors. The model is trained on the Google Text Normalization dataset and achieves state-of-the-art sentence accuracy on both English and Russian test sets. One-to-one correspondence between tags and input words improves the interpretability of the model's predictions, simplifies debugging, and allows for post-processing corrections.

    "abstract": "In this paper, we conduct a comparative study on speaker-attributed automatic speech recognition (SA-ASR) in the multi-party meeting scenario, a topic with increasing attention in meeting rich transcription. Specifically, three approaches are evaluated in this study. The first approach, FD-SOT, consists of a frame-level diarization model to identify speakers and a multi-talker ASR to recognize utterances. The speaker-attributed transcriptions are obtained by aligning the diarization results and recognized hypotheses. However, such an alignment strategy may suffer from erroneous timestamps due to the modular independence, severely hindering the model performance. Therefore, we propose the second approach, WD-SOT, to address alignment errors by introducing a word-level diarization model, which can get rid of such timestamp alignment dependency. To further mitigate the alignment issues, we propose the third approach, TS-ASR, which trains a target-speaker separation module and an ASR module jointly. By comparing various strategies for each SA-ASR approach, experimental results on a real meeting scenario corpus, AliMeeting, reveal that the WD-SOT approach achieves 10.7% relative reduction on averaged speaker-dependent character error rate (SD-CER), compared with the FD-SOT approach. In addition, the TS-ASR approach also outperforms the FD-SOT approach and brings 16.5% relative average SD-CER reduction",

    "abstract": "Real-time communications in packet-switched networks have become widely used in daily communication, while they inevitably suffer from network delays and data losses in constrained real-time conditions. To solve these problems, audio packet loss concealment (PLC) algorithms have been developed to mitigate voice transmission failures by reconstructing the lost information. Limited by the transmission latency and device memory, it is still intractable for PLC to accomplish high-quality voice reconstruction using a relatively small packet buffer. In this paper, we propose a temporal memory generative adversarial network for audio PLC, dubbed TMGAN-PLC, which is comprised of a novel nested-UNet generator and the time-domain/frequency-domain discriminators. Specifically, a combination of the nested-UNet and temporal feature-wise linear modulation is elaborately devised in the generator to finely adjust the intra-frame information and establish inter-frame temporal dependencies. To complement the missing speech content caused by longer loss bursts, we employ multi-stage gated vector quantizers to capture the correct content and reconstruct the near-real smooth audio. Extensive experiments on the PLC Challenge dataset demonstrate that the proposed method yields promising performance in terms of speech quality, intelligibility, and PLCMOS",

Various studies have used separate pretrained enhancement models as the front-end module of the SV system in noisy environments, and these methods effectively remove noises. However, the denoising process of independent enhancement models not tailored to the SV task can also distort the speaker information included in utterances. We argue that the enhancement network and speaker embedding extractor should be fully jointly trained for SV tasks under noisy conditions to alleviate this issue. Therefore, we proposed a U-Net-based integrated framework that simultaneously optimizes speaker identification and feature enhancement losses. Moreover, we analyzed the structural limitations of using U-Net directly for noise SV tasks and further proposed Extended U-Net to reduce these drawbacks. We evaluated the models on the noise-synthesized VoxCeleb1 test set and VOiCES development set recorded in various noisy scenarios.

    "abstract": "The emergence of large-margin softmax cross-entropy losses in training deep speaker embedding neural networks has triggered a gradual shift from parametric back-ends to a simpler cosine similarity measure for speaker verification. Popular parametric back-ends include the probabilistic linear discriminant analysis (PLDA) and its variants. This paper investigates the properties of margin-based cross-entropy losses leading to such a shift and aims to find scoring back-ends best suited for speaker verification. In addition, we revisit the pre-processing techniques which have been widely used in the past and assess their effectiveness on large-margin embeddings. Experiments on the state-of-the-art ECAPA-TDNN networks trained with various large-margin softmax cross-entropy losses show a substantial increment in intra-speaker compactness making the conventional PLDA superfluous. In this regard, we found that constraining the within-speaker covariance matrix could improve the performance of the PLDA. It is demonstrated through a series of experiments on the VoxCeleb-1 and SITW core-core test sets with 40.8% equal error rate (EER) reduction and 35.1% minimum detection cost (minDCF) reduction.

    "abstract": "Deep speaker embeddings have been shown to encode a wide variety of attributes relating to a speaker. The aim of this work is to separate out some of these attributes in the embedding space, disentangling these sources of speaker variation into subsets of the embedding dimensions. This is achieved modifying the training procedure of a typical speaker embedding network, which is typically only trained to classify speakers. This work instead adds pairs of attribute specific task heads to operate on complementary subsets of the speaker embedding dimensions. While specific dimensions are encouraged to encode an attribute, for example gender, the other dimensions are penalized for containing this information using an adversarial loss. We show that this method is effective in factorizing out multiple attributes in the embedding space, successfully disentangling gender, nationality and age. Using the disentangled representations, we investigate how much removing this information impacts speaker verification and diarization performance, showing that gender is a significant source of separation in the deep speaker embedding space, with nationality and age also contributing to a lesser degree",

The usual practice is to learn domain adaptation and bandwidth extension models independently. Contrary to this, we propose to learn both tasks together.

We developed parallel and non-parallel learning solutions which utilize both paired and unpaired data. We first discuss joint and disjoint training of multiple generative models for our tasks. Then, we propose a two-stage learning solution using a pre-trained domain adaptation system for pre-processing in bandwidth extension training. We evaluated our schemes on a Speaker Verification downstream task. We used the JHU-MIT experimental setup for NIST SRE21, which comprises SRE16, SRE-CTS Superset, and SRE21. Our results prove that learning both tasks is better than learning just one.

In this study, we reconstructed the vocal tract geometry with three repetitive magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) on the same subject and investigated the effects of coronal vocal tract shapes on the airflow and sound characteristics in [ç]. The computational grids were constructed on each vocal tract and a numerical airflow simulation was conducted to predict the turbulent airflow and aeroacoustic sound generation. The predicted sound properties were in good agreement with the measurement of Japanese subjects. The comparison of the airflow and acoustic characteristics among three vocal tracts showed that the slight changes of the constriction area and flow channel downstream from the constriction influenced the sound source generation and peak amplitudes at around 3 kHz, indicating that the characteristic peak of [ç] was variable due to the constriction shape at the middle part of the hard palate",

Recently, transformer-based AAI models have been shown to achieve state-of-art performance. However, in transformer networks, the attention is applied over the whole utterance, thereby needing to obtain the full utterance before the inference, which leads to high latency and is impractical for streaming AAI. To enable streaming during inference, evaluation could be performed on non-overlapping chucks instead of full utterance. However, due to a mismatch of attention receptive field during training and evaluation, there could be a drop in AAI performance. To overcome this scenario, in this work we perform experiments with different attention masks and use context from previous predictions during training. Experiments results revealed that using the random start mask attention with the context from previous predictions of transformer encoder performs better than the baseline results",

In our OFC model commands are estimated via the minimisation of a cost that combines neuromuscular effort, and a penalty on accuracy of the auditory patterns reached for the phonemes. The biomechanics of the plant are implemented by an LSTM trained on simulations of a finite element model of the tongue.

The current study investigates the acoustics and articulation of allophonic variations in English laterals produced by Japanese speakers, focusing on the effects of syllabic positions and flanking vowels. Acoustic and articulatory data were obtained from five Japanese speakers in a simultaneous audio and high-speed ultrasound tongue imaging recording set-up while they read sentences containing syllable-initial and -final tokens of English /l/ in four different vowel contexts. Acoustic analysis was conducted on 500 tokens using linear-mixed effects modelling and the articulatory data were analysed using generalised additive mixed modelling. Syllable position and vowel context had significant effects on acoustics, while midsagittal tongue shape was more influenced by vowel context, with fewer positional effects. The results demonstrate that differences in acoustics not always be mirrored exactly by midsagittal tongue shape, suggesting multidimensionality of articulation in second language speech",

Our work introduces SAQAM which uses a multi-task learning framework to assess listening quality (LQ) and spatialization quality (SQ) between any given pair of binaural signals without using any subjective data. We model LQ by training on a simulated dataset of triplet human judgments, and SQ by utilizing activation-level distances from networks trained for direction of arrival (DOA) estimation. We show that SAQAM correlates well with human responses across four diverse datasets. Since it is a deep network, the metric is differentiable, making it suitable as a loss function for other tasks.

We found that making scientific visualization by animating these plots enables us to understand different pitch extractors' behavior at once. Such efficient and effortless inspection is impossible by inspecting all individual plots. The proposed measurement method with visualization leads to further improvement of the performance of one of the extractors mentioned above.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Fake audio detection (FAD) is a technique to distinguish synthetic speech from natural speech. In most FAD systems, removing irrelevant features from acoustic speech while keeping only robust discriminative features is essential. Intuitively, speaker information entangled in acoustic speech should be suppressed for the FAD task. Particularly in a deep neural network (DNN)-based FAD system, the learning system may learn speaker information from a training dataset and cannot generalize well on a testing dataset. In this paper, we propose to use the speaker anonymization (SA) technique to suppress speaker information from acoustic speech before inputting it into a DNN-based FAD system. We adopted the McAdams-coefficient-based SA (MC-SA) algorithm, and this is expected that the entangled speaker information will not be involved in the DNN-based FAD learning. Based on this idea, we implemented a light convolutional neural network bidirectional long short-term memory (LCNN-BLSTM)-based FAD system and conducted experiments on the Audio Deep Synthesis Detection Challenge (ADD2022) datasets. The results showed that removing the speaker information from acoustic speech improved the relative performance in the first track of ADD2022 by 17.66%",

Now, selecting the most relevant augmentations has proven crucial for better downstream performances. Thus, this work introduces a conditional independance-based method which allows for automatically selecting a suitable distribution on the choice of augmentations and their parametrization from a set of predefined ones, for contrastive self-supervised pre-training. This is performed with respect to a downstream task of interest, hence saving a costly hyper-parameter search. Experiments performed on two different downstream tasks validate the proposed approach showing better results than experimenting without augmentation or with baseline augmentations.

However, such corpora have properties that hinder downstream performance, including being (1) too large, (2) beset with domain-mismatched content, and (3) heavy-headed rather than heavy-tailed (excessively many duplicate search queries such as \"weather\"). We show that three simple strategies for selecting language modeling data can dramatically improve rare-word recognition without harming overall performance. First, to address the heavy-headedness, we downsample the data according to a soft log function, which tunably reduces high frequency (head) sentences. Second, to encourage rare-word exposure, we explicitly filter for words rare in the acoustic data. Finally, we tackle domain-mismatch via perplexity-based contrastive selection, filtering for examples matched to the target domain. We down-select a large corpus of web search queries by a factor of 53x and achieve better LM perplexities than without down-selection. When shallow-fused with a state-of-the-art, production speech engine, our LM achieves WER reductions of up to 24\\% relative on rare-word sentences (without changing overall WER) compared to a baseline LM trained on the raw corpus.

In order to bridge the research gap, we take the bidirectional encoder representations from Transformers (BERT) model as an example to explore novel uses of a pre-trained model for language modeling. More formally, this paper proposes a set of BERT-based language models, and a neural-based dynamic adaptation method is also introduced to combine these language models systematically and methodically.

    "abstract": "This work investigates privacy-aware collaborative wake word detection (WWD) in acoustic sensor networks. To meet state-of-the-art privacy constraints, the proposed WWD scheme is based on privacy-aware unsupervised clustered federated learning that groups microphone nodes w.r.t. active sound sources and on a privacy-preserving high-level feature representation. Using the partition of microphone nodes into clusters, we apply intra- and inter-cluster feature enhancement strategies directly in the privacy-preserving feature domain and thus circumvent the need for communicating privacy-sensitive information between nodes. The approach is demonstrated for an acoustic sensor network deployed in a smart-home environment. We show that the proposed collaborative WWD system clearly outperforms independent decisions of individual microphone nodes.

    "abstract": "Any audio recording encapsulates the unique fingerprint of the associated acoustic environment, namely the background noise and reverberation. Considering the scenario of a room equipped with a fixed smart speaker device with one or more microphones and a wearable smart device (watch, glasses or smartphone), we employed the improved proportionate normalized least mean square adaptive filter to estimate the relative room impulse response mapping the audio recordings of the two devices. We performed inter-device distance estimation by exploiting a new set of features obtained extending the definition of some acoustic attributes of the room impulse response to its relative version. In combination with the sparseness measure of the estimated relative room impulse response, the relative features allow precise inter-device distance estimation which can be exploited for tasks such as best microphone selection or acoustic scene analysis. Experimental results from simulated rooms of different dimensions and reverberation times demonstrate the effectiveness of this computationally lightweight approach for smart home acoustic ranging applications",

    "abstract": "Deep neural networks (DNNs) are very effective for multichannel speech enhancement with fixed array geometries. However, it is not trivial to use DNNs for ad-hoc arrays with unknown order and placement of microphones. We propose a novel triple-path network for ad-hoc array processing in the time domain. The key idea in the network design is to divide the overall processing into spatial processing and temporal processing and use self-attention for spatial processing. Using self-attention for spatial processing makes the network invariant to the order and the number of microphones. The temporal processing is done independently for all channels using a recently proposed dual-path attentive recurrent network. The proposed network is a multiple-input multiple-output architecture that can simultaneously enhance signals at all microphones. Experimental results demonstrate the excellent performance of the proposed approach. Further, we present analysis to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed network in utilizing multichannel information even from microphones at far locations",

    "abstract": "This study investigated the relationship between tongue movements during the production of German diphthongs and their acoustic time intervals. To this end, five subjects produced a set of logatomes that contained German primary, secondary, and peripheral diphthongs in the context of bilabial and labiodental consonants at three different speaking rates. During the utterances, tongue movements were measured by means of optical palatography (OPG), i.e. by optical distance sensing in the oral cavity, along with the acoustic speech signal. The analysis of the movement signals revealed that the diphthongs have s-shaped tongue trajectories that strongly resemble half cosine periods. In addition, acoustic and articulatory diphthong durations have a linear, but not proportional, relationship. Finally, the peak velocity and midpoint between the two targets of a diphthong are reached in the middle of both the acoustic and articulatory diphthong time intervals, regardless of the duration and type of diphthong. These results can help to model realistic tongue movements for diphthongs in articulatory speech synthesis",

Japanese children aged 5–13 years and adults participated in an elicited production task. We analyzed developmental changes in allophonic variation of the phoneme /z/, which is realized variably either as an affricate or a fricative. The results revealed that children aged nine years or younger realized /z/ as affricate significantly more than 13-year-old and adult speakers. Once the children reached 11 years of age, the difference compared to adults was not statistically significant, which denotes a similar developmental pattern as that of speech motor control (e.g., lip and jaw) and cognitive-linguistic skill. Moreover, we examined whether the developmental changes of allophonic realization of /z/ are due to speech rate and the time to articulate /z/. The results showed that the allophonic realization of /z/ is not affected by those factors, different from that of adults. We also found that the effects of speech rate and the time to articulate /z/ on the allophonic realization become adult-like at around 11 years of age",

Attention mechanism is essential component in multimodal fusion architecture as it dynamically pairs different regions within multimodal sequences.

Thus we propose recurrent multi-head attention in a fusion architecture, which selects salient fused representations and learns dynamics between them. Multiple 2-D attention layers select salient pairs among all possible pairs of audio and text representations, which are combined with fusion operation. Lastly, multiple fused representations are fed into recurrent unit to learn dynamics between fused representations.

Whilst some benefits can be gained by initialising both narrow and wide-band filters, physiological constraints suggest that such filters arise in mid-brain rather than the cochlea.

We measured first and second formants together with tongue blade and dorsum trajectories from 20 speakers producing 330 words in citation forms. Using the network analysis, the relationships between acoustic and kinematic variables were revealed. In particular, between-speaker articulatory behaviors were most dissimilar in /ɑ/ which requires less inherent spectral change. Moreover, when networks of speakers with similar formant patterns were compared, it was revealed that their articulatory behaviors also shared similarities, although they seemed to be organized in characteristic ways.

However, the intelligibility of presented speech using BC headphones is degraded by BC transmission, especially in noisy environments. This paper proposes a method for improving the word intelligibility of presented BC speech under noisy conditions. The method consists of two types of emphasis: higher-frequency emphasis and consonant emphasis. In the higher-frequency emphasis, frequency components attenuated due to BC transmission were compensated by the inverse-filtering of the transfer function obtained from the regio-temporalis (RT) vibration or the EC radiated sound. In the consonant emphasis, consonant sections with 20-ms short-formant trajectories of subsequent vowels in speech signals were locally amplified by a constant gain. The results of word intelligibility tests showed that both types of emphasis had significant improvements in comparison with no-emphasis. Moreover, we found that the proposed method had the best improvements under all conditions",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "The finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) method has been widely used for vocal tract acoustic modelling due to its simplicity and low computational cost. Nevertheless, the method suffers from high discretization error while approximating realistic vocal tract geometries using orthogonal grid elements. Alternatively, simplified vocal tract shapes having regular contours can be used for articulatory models. These geometries can be generated from one-dimensional (1D) area functions, which approximate vocal tracts as concatenated tubes with different cross-sections. To this aim, we modify an existing 3D FDTD model for faster acoustic simulation and synthesize five English vowels with various simplified vocal tract shapes. We implement six geometrical shapes for each vowel, consisting of circular, elliptical and square cross-sections with centric and eccentric tube segment configurations. Vowel transfer functions obtained from these FDTD simulations are compared with a highly accurate finite element (FE) scheme. The acoustic formants of the FDTD model agree well with the corresponding FEM approach for most vowels. The influence of vocal tracts with different geometry approximations remains insignificant for frequencies below $5$~kHz. However, vocal tracts with elliptical or eccentric configurations have produced higher-order acoustic modes. This paper characterizes the acoustic properties of simplified vocal tract shapes using the 3D FDTD scheme",

It happens automatically and unconsciously, but people can also deliberately imitate others when asked to do so. Here, we investigate to what degree people converge to their interlocutor in a scripted dialogue when they are and when they are not explicitly requested to imitate their interlocutor. More specifically, we collected two separate data sets, where Italian- and French-native participants read English sentences aloud in alternating speaking turns. The results of both groups with different language backgrounds were compared against each other. We used a Gaussian mixture model – universal background model (GMM-UBM) to assess phonetic convergence on the sentence level. The GMM-UBM configuration was optimized to make the best distinction between speakers on validation data. We found that people start to converge to one another while interacting compared to the baseline and even more substantially when explicitly asked to do so. Results are robust across data sets. More importantly, the degree of implicit convergence people display is related to how good of an explicit imitator they are, supporting the claim that the two phenomena are based on the same neurocognitive process",

Using articulatory modeling and deep learning, this study examines how this articulatory information can be used for discovering speech units in a self-supervised setting. We used vector-quantized variational autoencoders (VQ-VAE) to learn discrete representations from articulatory and acoustic speech data. In line with the zero-resource paradigm, an ABX test was then used to investigate how the extracted representations encode phonetically relevant properties. Experiments were conducted on three different corpora in English and French. We found that articulatory information rather organises the latent representations in terms of place of articulation whereas the speech acoustics mainly structure the latent space in terms of manner of articulation. We show that an optimal fusion of the two modalities can lead to a joint representation of these phonetic dimensions more accurate than each modality considered individually. Since articulatory information is usually not available in a practical situation, we finally investigate the benefit it provides when inferred from the speech acoustics in a self-supervised manner",

This task provides a promising direction for speech synthesis research, as the articulatory space is compact, smooth, and interpretable.

However, it remains unclear whether these models can achieve the efficiency and fidelity of the human speech production system. To help bridge this gap, we propose a time-domain articulatory synthesis methodology and demonstrate its efficacy with both electromagnetic articulography (EMA) and synthetic articulatory feature inputs. Our model is computationally efficient and achieves a transcription word error rate (WER) of 18.5% for the EMA-to-speech task, yielding an improvement of 11.6% compared to prior work.

In the case of speech, receiving somatosensory inputs together with corresponding speech sounds may be a key to formulate or calibrate the speech production system [2]. We here examined whether speech production can be modulated by perceptual training with repetitive exposure to paired auditory-somatosensory stimulation in the absence of actual production of the sound. We carried out a perceptual training using a vowel identification task with /e/-/eu/ continuum. The speech sounds were accompanied with somatosensory stimulation, in which a facial skin-stretch was applied in the backward direction. The vowels /e/ and /eu/ were recorded prior to and following the training and the first three formants were compared. Results showed that the third formant of /e/ was increased following the training, and the rest of formant was not changed. Since the current somatosensory stimulation was related to the articulatory movement for the production of /e/ (lip-spreading), repetitive exposure to somatosensory stimulation in addition to the sound may specifically change the articulatory behavior for the production of /e/. The results suggest that perceptual training with specific pairs of auditory-somatosensory inputs can be important to formulate production mechanisms",
