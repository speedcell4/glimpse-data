    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "In this paper, we present SANE-TTS, a stable and natural end-to-end multilingual TTS model. By the difficulty of obtaining multilingual corpus for given speaker, training multilingual TTS model with monolingual corpora is unavoidable. We introduce speaker regularization loss that improves speech naturalness during cross-lingual synthesis as well as domain adversarial training, which is applied in other multilingual TTS models. Furthermore, by adding speaker regularization loss, replacing speaker embedding with zero vector in duration predictor stabilizes cross-lingual inference. With this replacement, our model generates speeches with moderate rhythm regardless of source speaker in cross-lingual synthesis. In MOS evaluation, SANE-TTS achieves naturalness score above 3.80 both in cross-lingual and intralingual synthesis, where the ground truth score is 3.99. Also, SANE-TTS maintains speaker similarity close to that of ground truth even in cross-lingual inference. Audio samples are available on our web page",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "The recently developed pitch-controllable text-to-speech (TTS) model, i.e. FastPitch, was conditioned for the pitch contours. However, the quality of the synthesized speech degraded considerably for pitch values that deviated significantly from the average pitch; i.e. the ability to control vocal pitch was limited. To address this issue, we propose two algorithms to improve the robustness of FastPitch. First, we propose a novel timbre-preserving pitch-shifting algorithm for natural pitch augmentation. Pitch-shifted speech samples sound more natural when using the proposed algorithm because the speaker's vocal timbre is maintained. Moreover, we propose a training algorithm that defines FastPitch using pitch-augmented speech datasets with different pitch ranges for the same sentence. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithms improve the pitch controllability of FastPitch",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Since neural Text-To-Speech models have achieved such high standards in terms of naturalness, the main focus of the field has gradually shifted to gaining more control over the expressiveness of the synthetic voices. One of these leverages is the control of the speaking rate that has become harder for a human operator to control since the introduction of neural attention networks to model speech dynamics. While numerous models have reintroduced an explicit duration control (ex: FastSpeech2), these models generally rely on additional tasks to complete during their training. In this paper, we show how an acoustic analysis of the internal embeddings delivered by the encoder of an unsupervised end-to-end TTS Tacotron2 model is enough to identify and control some acoustic parameters of interest. Specifically, we compare this speaking rate control with the duration control offered by a supervised FastSpeech2 model. Experimental results show that the control provided by embeddings reproduces a behaviour closer to natural speech data",

    "abstract": "Three research directions that have recently advanced the text-to-speech (TTS) field are end-to-end architecture, prosody control modeling, and on-the-fly duration alignment of non-auto-regressive models. However, these three agendas have yet to be tackled at once in a single solution. Current studies are limited either by a lack of control over prosody modeling or by the inefficient training inherent in building a two-stage TTS pipeline. We propose TriniTTS, a pitch-controllable end-to-end TTS without an external aligner that generates natural speech by addressing the issues mentioned above at once. It eliminates the training inefficiency in the two-stage TTS pipeline by the end-to-end architecture. Moreover, it manages to learn the latent vector representing the data distribution of the speeches through performing tasks (alignment search, pitch estimation, waveform generation) simultaneously. Experimental results demonstrate that TriniTTS enables prosody modeling with user input parameters to generate deterministic speech, while synthesizing comparable speech to the state-of-the-art VITS. Furthermore, eliminating normalizing flow modules used in VITS increases the inference speed by 28.84% in CPU environment and by 29.16% in GPU environment",

For example, FastSpeech2 transforms an input text to a mel-spectrogram and then HiFi-GAN generates a raw waveform from a mel-spectogram where they are called an acoustic feature generator and a neural vocoder respectively. However, their training pipeline is somewhat cumbersome in that it requires a fine-tuning and an accurate speech-text alignment for optimal performance. In this work, we present end-to-end text-to-speech (E2E-TTS) model which has a simplified training pipeline and outperforms a cascade of separately learned models. Specifically, our proposed model is jointly trained FastSpeech2 and HiFi-GAN with an alignment module. Since there is no acoustic feature mismatch between training and inference, it does not requires fine-tuning. Furthermore, we remove dependency on an external speech-text alignment tool by adopting an alignment learning objective in our joint training framework.

We focus on Speaker Adaptation (SA) in command speech recognition, where data from multiple sources (i.e., multiple speakers) are available. Specifically, we propose an unsupervised Multi-Source Domain Adaptation (MSDA) algorithm based on optimal-transport, called MSDA via Weighted Joint Optimal Transport (MSDA-WJDOT). We achieve a Command Error Rate relative reduction of 16% and 7% over the speaker-independent model and the best competitor method, respectively. The strength of the proposed approach is that, differently from any other existing SA method, it offers an interpretable model that can also be exploited, in this context, to diagnose dysarthria without any specific training. Indeed, it provides a closeness measure between the target and the source speakers, reflecting their similarity in terms of speech characteristics. Based on the similarity between the target speaker and the healthy/dysarthric source speakers, we then define the healthy/dysarthric score of the target speaker that we leverage to perform dysarthria detection. This approach does not require any additional training and achieves a 95% accuracy in the dysarthria diagnosis",

    "abstract": "Raw waveform acoustic modelling has recently received increasing attention. Compared with the task-blind hand-crafted features which may discard useful information, representations directly learned from the raw waveform are task-specific and potentially include all task-relevant information. In the context of automatic dysarthric speech recognition (ADSR), raw waveform acoustic modelling is under-explored owing to data scarcity. Parametric convolutional neural networks (CNNs) can compensate for this problem due to having notably fewer parameters and requiring less training data in comparison with conventional non-parametric CNNs. In this paper, we explore the usefulness of raw waveform acoustic modelling using various parametric CNNs for ADSR. We investigate the properties of the learned filters and monitor the training dynamics of various models. Furthermore, we study the effectiveness of data augmentation and multi-stream acoustic modelling through combining the non-parametric and parametric CNNs fed by hand-crafted and raw waveform features. Experimental results on the TORGO dysarthric database show that the parametric CNNs significantly outperform the non-parametric CNNs, reaching up to 36.2% and 12.6% WERs (up to 3.4% and 1.1% absolute error reduction) for dysarthric and typical speech, respectively. Multi-stream acoustic modelling further improves the performance resulting in up to 33.2% and 10.3% WERs for dysarthric and typical speech, respectively",

A proven solution to this problem is by first pretraining the model on a huge number of healthy speech datasets and then fine-tuning it on the pathological speech datasets. One new pretraining framework called self-supervised learning (SSL) trains a network using only speech data, providing more flexibility in training data requirements and allowing more speech data to be used in pretraining. We investigate SSL frameworks such as the wav2vec 2.0 and WavLM models using different setups and compare their performance with different supervised pretraining setups, using two types of pathological speech, namely, Japanese electrolaryngeal and English dysarthric. Our results show that although SSL has shown success with minimally resourced healthy speech, we do not find this to be the case with pathological speech.

Deep Autoencoder (DAE)-based healthy speech modification and various perturbations comprise static augmentations, whereas SpecAugment techniques modified to specifically augment dysarthric speech comprise the dynamic data augmentation. The objective of this work is to improve the ASR performance for dysarthric speech using the two-stage data augmentation scheme. An end-to-end ASR using a Transformer acoustic model is used to evaluate the data augmentation scheme on speech from the UA dysarthric speech corpus.

The current study explores the usefulness of using Wav2Vec self-supervised speech representations as features for training an ASR system for dysarthric speech. Dysarthric speech recognition is particularly difficult as several aspects of speech such as articulation, prosody and phonation can be impaired. Specifically, we train an acoustic model with features extracted from Wav2Vec, Hubert, and the cross-lingual XLSR model. Results suggest that speech representations pretrained on large unlabelled data can improve word error rate (WER) performance. In particular, features from the multilingual model led to lower WERs than Fbanks or models trained on a single language. Improvements were seen in English speakers with cerebral palsy caused dysarthria (UASpeech corpus), Spanish speakers with Parkinsonian dysarthria (PC-GITA corpus) and Italian speakers with paralysis-based dysarthria (EasyCall corpus).

Numerous types of neural network-based AMs have been studied, but the structure that has received the most attention in recent years is the Transformer. In this study, we demonstrate that the Transformer model is more vulnerable to input sparsity compared to the convolutional neural network (CNN) and analyze the cause of performance degradation through structural characteristics of the Transformer. Moreover, we also propose a novel regularization method that makes the transformer model robust against input sparsity. The proposed sparsity regularization method directly regulates attention weights using silence label information in forced-alignment and has the advantage of not requiring additional module training and excessive computation. We tested the proposed method on five benchmarks and observed an average relative error rate reduction (RERR) of 4.7%",

When humans learn to speak, they first try to utter basic phones and then gradually move towards more complex structures such as words and sentences. This methodology is known as Curriculum Learning, and we employ it in the context of Automatic Speech Recognition. We hypothesize that end-to-end models can achieve better performance when provided with an organized training set consisting of examples that exhibit an increasing level of difficulty (i.e. a curriculum). To impose structure on the training set and to define the notion of an easy example, we explored multiple scoring functions that either use feedback from an external neural network or incorporate feedback from the model itself.

We want to show that this change fits in with prosodic change: specifically, the grammaticalised item undergoes prosodic reduction. We test the latter hypothesis on the peculiar Italo-Romance dialect Gazzolese, where mia, the particle undergoing JC, can be used both as the erstwhile contrastive function and as a function word denoting negation (it can appear, for example, in Broad Focus statements). The results confirm that when mia is used as a function word, it displays a shorter duration, a reduced intensity excursion, and does not associate with a pitch accent, in comparison to the original contrastive context.

Results indicate that quantifiable VLMs observed for each sentence range from 3 to 6 movements, with 4 movements per sentence being the most frequent. Sentences with focus have more instances of VLM per sentence than those without.

In the present study, we investigate f0 variability over the course of a telephone conversation, with a focus on the initial and medial utterances within the exchange. We examined f0 standard deviation of each utterance in over 2000 telephone conversations from 509 American English speakers from the Switchboard corpus. Findings showed that on average, speakers exhibit more f0 variability in the opening compared to mid-conversation utterances. Further, findings suggest that the inclusion of a greeting word in an initial turn, e.g., \"hello\" or \"hi\", corresponds to an increase in f0 standard deviation. These results suggest that speakers employed more variable f0 in the initial few turns of a telephone conversation. The interpretation of this finding is multifaceted and may be linked to several communicative goals, including the placement of identity markers in conversation or the attraction of attention, or the role of openings as boundary markers",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Speech translation models are unable to directly process long audios, like TED talks, which have to be split into shorter segments. Speech translation datasets provide manual segmentations of the audios, which are not available in real-world scenarios, and existing segmentation methods usually significantly reduce translation quality at inference time. To bridge the gap between the manual segmentation of training and the automatic one at inference, we propose Supervised Hybrid Audio Segmentation (SHAS), a method that can effectively learn the optimal segmentation from any manually segmented speech corpus. First, we train a classifier to identify the included frames in a segmentation, using speech representations from a pre-trained wav2vec 2.0. The optimal splitting points are then found by a probabilistic Divide-and-Conquer algorithm that progressively splits at the frame of lowest probability until all segments are below a pre-specified length. Experiments on MuST-C and mTEDx show that the translation of the segments produced by our method approaches the quality of the manual segmentation on 5 languages pairs. Namely, SHAS retains 95-98% of the manual segmentation's BLEU score, compared to the 87-93% of the best existing methods. Our method is additionally generalizable to different domains and achieves high zero-shot performance in unseen languages",

    "abstract": "End-to-end speech-to-text translation models are often initialized with pre-trained speech encoder and pre-trained text decoder. This leads to a significant training gap between pre-training and fine-tuning, largely due to the modality differences between speech outputs from the encoder and text inputs to the decoder. In this work, we aim to bridge the modality gap between speech and text to improve translation quality. We propose M-Adapter, a novel Transformer-based module, to adapt speech representations to text. While shrinking the speech sequence, M-Adapter produces features desired for speech-to-text translation via modelling global and local dependencies of a speech sequence.

These systems need to decide when to read more input and when to write the output.

Hence, read/write decision policy remains the same across different input modalities, i.e., speech and text. This motivates us to leverage the text transcripts corresponding to the speech input for improving simultaneous speech-to-text translation (SimulST). We propose Cross-Modal Decision Regularization (CMDR) to improve the decision policy of SimulST systems by using the simultaneous text-to-text translation (SimulMT) task. We also extend several techniques from the offline speech translation domain to explore the role of SimulMT task in improving SimulST performance.

Triplet loss is added to the Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) loss in the ASR while training.

In contrast, the Multi-View recurrent method that learns jointly on the text and acoustic embeddings achieves only 0.218 for out-of-vocabulary words. This method is also applied to low-resource languages such as Tamil by converting Tamil characters to English using transliteration. This is a very challenging novel task for which we provide a dataset of transcripts for the keywords.

    "abstract": "Since each of the currently available emotional speech corpora is rather small to deal with personal or cultural diversity, multiple emotional speech corpora can be jointly used to train a speech emotion recognition (SER) model robust to unseen corpora. Each corpus has different characteristics, including whether acted or spontaneous, in which environment it was recorded, and what lexical contents it contains. Depending on the characteristics, the emotion recognition accuracy and time required to train a model for it are different. If we train the SER model utilizing multiple corpora equally, the classification performance for each training corpus would be different. The performance for unseen corpora may be enhanced if the model is trained to show similar recognition accuracy for each training corpus that covers different characteristics. In this study, we propose to adopt corpus-wise weights in the classification loss, which are functions of the recognition accuracy for each of the training corpus. We also adopt pseudo-emotion labels for the unlabeled speech corpus to further enhance the performance.

To improve the attention area, we propose to use a Focus-Attention (FA) mechanism and a novel Calibration-Attention (CA) mechanism in combination with the multi-head self-attention. Through the FA mechanism, the network can detect the largest amplitude part in the segment. By employing the CA mechanism, the network can modulate the information flow by assigning different weights to each attention head and improve the utilization of surrounding contexts.

However, it is expensive and difficult to label the emotion of a sentence with confidence or multi-label. In this paper, we automatically construct a grayscale label considering the correlation between emotions and use it for learning. That is, instead of using a given label as a one-hot encoding, we construct a grayscale label by measuring scores for different emotions. We introduce several methods for constructing grayscale labels and confirm that each method improves the emotion recognition performance.

Valence predictions of the transformer model are very reactive to positive and negative sentiment content, as well as negations, but not to intensifiers or reducers, while none of those linguistic features impact arousal or dominance.

To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first to use Bayesian neural networks for speech emotion recognition. At training, the network learns a distribution of weights to capture the inherent uncertainty related to subjective arousal annotations. To this end, we introduce a loss term that enables the model to be explicitly trained on a distribution of annotations, rather than training them exclusively on mean or gold-standard labels.

Silence represents an important paralinguistic component in communication. For example, some of its functions include conveying emphasis, dramatization, or even sarcasm. In speech emotion recognition (SER), there has been relatively little work on investigating the utility of silence and no work regarding the effect of silence on linguistics. In this work, we present a novel framework which investigates fusing linguistic and silence representations for emotion recognition in naturalistic speech using the MSP-Podcast dataset. We investigate two methods to represent silence in SER models; the first approach uses utterance-level statistics, while the second learns a silence token embedding within a transformer language model. Our results show that modeling silence does improve SER performance and that modeling silence as a token in a transformer language model significantly improves performance on MSP-Podcast achieving a concordance correlation coefficient of .191 and .453 for activation and valence respectively. In addition, we perform analyses on the attention of silence and find that silence emphasizes the attention of its surrounding words",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Previous studies on speech emotion recognition (SER) with categorical emotions have often formulated the task as a single-label classification problem, where the emotions are considered orthogonal to each other. However, previous studies have indicated that emotions can co-occur, especially for more ambiguous emotional sentences (e.g., a mixture of happiness and surprise). Some studies have regarded SER problems as a multi-label task, predicting multiple emotional classes. However, this formulation does not leverage the relation between emotions during training, since emotions are assumed to be independent. This study explores the idea that emotional classes are not necessarily independent and its implications on training SER models. In particular, we calculate the frequency of co-occurring emotions from perceptual evaluations in the train set to generate a matrix with class-dependent penalties, punishing more mistakes between distant emotional classes. We integrate the penalization matrix into three existing label-learning approaches (hard-label, multi-label, and distribution-label learning) using the proposed modified loss. We train SER models using the penalty loss and commonly used cost functions for SER tasks. The evaluation of our proposed penalization matrix on the MSP-Podcast corpus shows important relative improvements in macro F1-score for hard-label learning (17.12%), multi-label learning (12.79%), and distribution-label learning (25.8%)",

We model the local cadence by using separate `positional encodings' for each modality in a transformer architecture. Our results show that emotion detection based on this strategy is better than when the modality specific cadence is ignored or normalized out by using a shared positional encoding. We also find that capturing the modality interdependence is not as important as is capturing of the local cadence of individual modalities.

    "abstract": "In most of practical scenarios, the announcement system must deliver speech messages in a noisy environment, in which the background noise cannot be cancelled out. The local noise reduces speech intelligibility and increases listening effort of the listener, hence hamper the effectiveness of announcement system. There has been reported that voices of professional announcers are clearer and more comprehensive than that of non-expert speakers in noisy environment. This finding suggests that the speech intelligibility might be related to the speaking style of professional announcer, which can be adapted using voice conversion method. Motivated by this idea, this paper proposes a speech intelligibility enhancement in noisy environment by applying voice conversion method on non-professional voice. We discovered that the professional announcers and non-professional speakers are clusterized into different clusters on the speaker embedding plane. This implies that the speech intelligibility can be controlled as an independent feature of speaker individuality. To examine the advantage of converted voice in noisy environment, we experimented using test words masked in pink noise at different SNR levels. The results of objective and subjective evaluations confirm that the speech intelligibility of converted voice is higher than that of original voice in low SNR conditions",

To alleviate this problem, this paper proposes a phase-aware speech enhancement method by estimating the magnitude and phase of a complex adaptive Wiener filter. In this method, a noise-robust vector-quantized variational autoencoder is utilized for estimating the magnitude Wiener filter by using the Itakura-Saito divergence on time-frequency domain, while the phase of the Wiener filter is estimated by a convolutional recurrent network using the scale-invariant signal-to-noise ratio constraint in the time domain. The proposed method was evaluated on the open Voice Bank+DEMAND dataset to provide a direct comparison with other speech enhancement studies and achieved the PESQ score of 2.85 and STOI score of 0.94, which is better than the state-of-art method based on cIRM estimation in the 2020 Deep Noise Challenge",

We further study the relationship between the noise robustness of SSL representation via clean-noisy distance (CN distance) and the layer importance for SE. Consequently, we found that SSL representations with lower noise robustness are more important. Furthermore, our experiments on the VCTK-DEMAND dataset demonstrated that fine-tuning an SSL representation with an SE model can outperform the SOTA SSL-based SE methods in PESQ, CSIG and COVL without invoking complicated network architectures.

    "abstract": "Deep learning has been widely adopted for speech applications. Many studies have shown that using the multiple objective framework and learned deep features is effective for improving system performance. In this paper, we propose a perceptual characteristics based multi-objective speech enhancement (SE) algorithm that combines the conventional loss and objective losses of pitch and timbre related features. Timbre related features include frequency modulation (encoded by the pitch contour), amplitude modulation (encoded by the energy contour), and speaker identity. For the speaker identity loss, we consider the deep features derived in a speaker identification system. The proposed algorithm consists of two parts, a LSTM based SE model and CNN based multi-objective models. The objective losses are derived between speech enhanced by the SE model and clean speech and combined with the SE loss for updating the SE model. The proposed algorithm is evaluated using the corpus of Taiwan Mandarin hearing in noise test (TMHINT). Experimental results show the proposed algorithm evidently outperforms the original SE model in all objective scores, including speech quality, speech intelligibility and signal distortion",

    "abstract": "Target speech extraction (TSE) extracts the speech of a target speaker in a mixture given auxiliary clues characterizing the speaker, such as an enrollment utterance. TSE addresses thus the challenging problem of simultaneously performing separation and speaker identification. There has been much progress in extraction performance following the recent development of neural networks for speech enhancement and separation. Most studies have focused on processing mixtures where the target speaker is actively speaking. However, the target speaker is sometimes silent in practice, i.e., inactive speaker (IS). A typical TSE system will tend to output a signal in IS cases, causing false alarms. This is a severe problem for the practical deployment of TSE systems. This paper aims at understanding better how well TSE systems can handle IS cases. We consider two approaches to deal with IS, (1) training a system to directly output zero signals or (2) detecting IS with an extra speaker verification module. We perform an extensive experimental comparison of these schemes in terms of extraction performance and IS detection using the LibriMix dataset and reveal their pros and cons",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Many state-of-the-art speech enhancement (SE) systems have recently used convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to extract multi-scale feature maps. However, CNN relies more on local texture than global shape, which is more susceptible to degraded spectrogram and may fail to capture the detailed structure of speech. Although some two-stage systems feed the first-stage enhanced and original noisy spectrograms to the second stage simultaneously, this does not guarantee sufficient guidance for the second stage since the first-stage spectrogram can not provide precise spectral details. In order to allow CNNs to perceive clear speech component boundary information, we compose feature maps with spectrograms containing evident speech components according to the mask value from the first stage. The positions corresponding to the mask greater than certain thresholds are extracted as feature maps. These feature maps make the boundary information of speech components obvious by ignoring others, thus making CNNs sensitive to input features. Experiments on the VB dataset show that with a proper decomposition numbers, the proposed method can enhance SE performance, which can provide 0.15 PESQ improvement. Besides, the proposed method is more effective for spectral detail recovery",

The presented framework allows for robust dereverberation on a single-channel noisy reverberant dataset similar to WHAMR!. The Kalman filtering WPE introduces distortions in the enhanced signal when predicting the filter variations from the residual error only, if the target speech power spectral density is not perfectly known and the observation is noisy. The proposed approach avoids these distortions by correcting the filter variations estimation in a data-driven way, increasing the robustness of the method to noisy scenarios. Furthermore, it yields a strong dereverberation and denoising performance compared to a DNN-supported recursive least squares variant of WPE, especially for highly noisy inputs",

We evaluate our proposed method on synthetic and recorded (LibriCSS) mixtures. We find that the spatial loss is most effective to train IVA-based separators.

The signal coarsely separated by blind source separation (BSS) has been used for training neural separators in an unsupervised manner. However, the performance is limited due to distortions in the supervision. In contrast, remix-cycle-consistent learning (RCCL) enables a separator to be trained on distortion-free observed mixtures by making the remixed mixtures obtained by repeatedly separating and remixing the two different mixtures closer to the original mixtures. Still, training with RCCL from scratch often falls into a trivial solution, i.e., not separating signals. The present study provides a novel unsupervised learning algorithm for the Seq-BF with two stacked neural separators, in which the separators are pre-trained using the BSS outputs and then fine-tuned with RCCL. Such configuration compensates for the shortcomings of both approaches: the guiding mechanism in Seq-BF accelerates separation to exceed BSS performance, thereby stabilizing RCCL. Experimental comparisons demonstrated that the proposed unsupervised learning achieved performance comparable to supervised learning (0.4 point difference in word error rate)",

Next, we further extend the time-dependent SCM by incorporating a newly proposed NTF model of the spatial features, thereby introducing spatial components. To exploit the relationship between the positions of sound sources in adjacent time frames, resulting from the naturally occurring continuity of the movement itself, we impose local smoothness on time-dependent components of the spatial features.

It is well known that artifacts introduced from pre-processing with no overlapping speech can be detrimental to recognition performance. This work proposes a finite-state based generative method trained on timing information in speech corpora, which leads to two main contributions. First, a method for generating arbitrary large datasets which follow desired statistics of real parties. Second, features extracted from the models are shown to have a correlation with speaker extraction performance. This leads to the contribution of quantifying how much difficulty in a mixture is due to turn-taking, factoring out other complexities in the signal.

Traditional feature fusion is often implemented via simple operations, such as element-wise addition or concatenation.

MFA-Conformer significantly outperforms the popular ECAPA-TDNN systems in both recognition performance and inference speed.

However, when the uttering voice is disturbed by another interfering speaker's voice, the speaker verification system usually cannot selectively extract only the target speaker's information. Some works have been done by introducing a speech separation network to separate the target speaker's speech in advance. However, adding a speech separation network for speaker verification task could be redundant. Here, we proposed enroll-aware attentive statistic pooling (EA-ASP) layer to help the speaker verification system extract specific speaker's information.

The aggregated representation encodes the geometric structure of the underlying feature distribution, which is expected to contain valuable speaker-specific information that may not be represented by the commonly used statistical measures like mean and variance.

    "abstract": "Recently, attention mechanisms have been applied successfully in neural network-based speaker verification systems. Incorporating the Squeeze-and-Excitation block into convolutional neural networks has achieved remarkable performance. However, it uses global average pooling (GAP) to simply average the features along time and frequency dimensions, which is incapable of preserving sufficient speaker information in the feature maps. In this study, we show that GAP is a special case of a discrete cosine transform (DCT) on time-frequency domain mathematically using only the lowest frequency component in frequency decomposition. To strengthen the speaker information extraction ability, we propose to utilize multi-frequency information and design two novel and effective attention modules, called Single-Frequency Single-Channel (SFSC) attention module and Multi-Frequency Single-Channel (MFSC) attention module. The proposed attention modules can effectively capture more speaker information from multiple frequency components on the basis of DCT. We conduct comprehensive experiments on the VoxCeleb datasets and a probe evaluation on the 1st 48-UTD forensic corpus. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed SFSC and MFSC attention modules can efficiently generate more discriminative speaker representations and outperform ResNet34-SE and ECAPA-TDNN systems with relative 20.9% and 20.2% reduction in EER, without adding extra network parameters",

    "abstract": "In spite of the impressive success of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in speaker recognition, our understanding to CNNs' internal functions is still limited. A major obstacle is that some popular visualization tools are difficult to apply, for example those producing saliency maps. The reason is that speaker information does not show clear spatial patterns in the temporal-frequency space, which makes it hard to interpret the visualization results, and hence hard to confirm the reliability of a visualization tool. In this paper, we conduct an extensive analysis on three popular visualization methods based on class activation map(CAM): Grad-CAM, Score-CAM and Layer-CAM, to investigate their reliability for speaker recognition tasks. Experiments conducted on a state-of-the-art ResNet34SE model show that the Layer-CAM algorithm can produce reliable visualization, and thus can be used as a promising tool to explain CNN-based speaker models.

    "abstract": "State-of-art speaker verification (SV) systems use a back-end model to score the similarity of speaker embeddings extracted from a neural network. The commonly used back-ends are the cosine scoring and the probabilistic linear discriminant analysis (PLDA) scoring. With the recently developed neural embeddings, the theoretically more appealing PLDA approach is found to have no advantage against or even be inferior to the simple cosine scoring in terms of verification performance. This paper presents an investigation on the relation between the two back-ends, aiming to explain the above counter-intuitive observation. It is shown that the cosine scoring is essentially a special case of PLDA scoring. In other words, by properly setting the parameters of PLDA, the two back-ends become equivalent. As a consequence, the cosine scoring not only inherits the basic assumptions for the PLDA but also introduces additional assumptions on speaker embeddings. Experiments show that the dimensional independence assumption required by the cosine scoring contributes most to the performance gap between the two methods under the domain-matched condition. When there is severe domain mismatch, the dimensional independence assumption does not hold and the PLDA would perform better than the cosine for domain adaptation",

Attention-based pooling layers have been widely used to aggregate a sequence of frame-level feature vectors into an utterance-level speaker embedding.

However, it is still a challenging problem to make a good trade off between performance and model complexity for convolution attention models, especially for speaker recognition systems on low-resource edge computing nodes (smartphone, embedded devices, etc.).

However, most works treat speech signal as a whole, leading to the neglect of the pronunciation structure that is unique to speech and reflects the cognitive process. Meanwhile, Transformer has heavy computational burden due to its full attention operation. In this paper, a hierarchical efficient framework, called SpeechFormer, which considers the structural characteristics of speech, is proposed and can be served as a general-purpose backbone for cognitive speech signal processing. The proposed SpeechFormer consists of frame, phoneme, word and utterance stages in succession, each performing a neighboring attention according to the structural pattern of speech with high computational efficiency. SpeechFormer is evaluated on speech emotion recognition (IEMOCAP & MELD) and neurocognitive disorder detection (Pitt & DAIC-WOZ) tasks, and the results show that SpeechFormer outperforms the standard Transformer-based framework while greatly reducing the computational cost.

However, due to the increase in noise interference, the generalization ability declines when the traditional features (e.g., raw waveforms and MFCCs) are fed directly to the statistical model to estimate a single fullband gSNR. In this paper, we propose a multi-subband-based gSNR estimation network (MSGNet). Specifically, we split the noisy speech waveforms into Bark-scale subbands to obtain higher resolution signals to the middle and low frequencies. Then, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are used to learn a non-linear function to estimate the speech and noise energy ratio of each subband from the input muti-subband features. Finally, by integrating subbands with different speech and noise energies, gSNR in the fullband is calculated. Extensive experimental results on the AURORA-2J dataset demonstrate that the proposed MSGNet significantly reduces the mean absolute error compared to other baseline gSNR estimation methods",

    "abstract": "Structuring the latent space in probabilistic deep generative models, e.g., variational autoencoders (VAEs), is important to yield more expressive models and interpretable representations, and to avoid overfitting. One way to achieve this objective is to impose a sparsity constraint on the latent variables, e.g., via a Laplace prior. However, such approaches usually complicate the training phase, and they sacrifice the reconstruction quality to promote sparsity. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective methodology to structure the latent space via a sparsity-promoting dictionary model, which assumes that each latent code can be written as a sparse linear combination of a dictionary's columns. In particular, we leverage a computationally efficient and tuning-free method, which relies on a zero-mean Gaussian latent prior with learnable variances. We derive a variational inference scheme to train the model. Experiments on speech generative modeling demonstrate the advantage of the proposed approach over competing techniques, since it promotes sparsity while not deteriorating the output speech quality",

The basic idea of DTTRN is to learn a corpus invariant deep neural network to bridge the source and target speech samples and their label information. Following this idea, we make use of a transductive learning way to enforce a deep regressor to build the relationship between the features and emotional labels jointly in both speech corpora. Meanwhile, we also design an emotion guided regularization term for learning DTTRN by aligning source and target speech samples feature distributions from three different scales. Thus, the DTTRN only absorbing the label information provided by source speech samples is able to correctly predict the emotions of the target ones. To evaluate DTTRN, we conduct extensive cross-corpus SER experiments on EmoDB, CASIA, and eNTERFACE corpora.

In addition, ASP allows a direct interface with an analog microphone without a power-hungry analog-to-digital converter. Here, we present power-efficient analog acoustic features (PEAF) that are validated by fabricated CMOS chips for running audio recognition.

A novel theoretical framework based on information theory is established to analyze the information flow in each individual stage of the feature extraction pipeline.

Since the affective content of speech is inherently modulated by an individual's physical and mental state, a substantial body of research has been devoted to the study of paralinguistic correlates of stress-inducing task load. Historically, voice stress analysis (VSA) has been conducted using conventional digital signal processing (DSP) techniques. Despite the development of modern methods based on deep neural networks (DNNs), accurately detecting stress in speech remains difficult due to the wide variety of stressors and considerable variability in the individual stress perception. To that end, we introduce a set of five datasets for task load detection in speech. The voice recordings were collected as either cognitive or physical stress was induced in the cohort of volunteers, with a cumulative number of more than a hundred speakers. We used the datasets to design and evaluate a novel self-supervised audio representation that leverages the effectiveness of handcrafted features (DSP-based) and the complexity of data-driven DNN representations.

The first one explores \"learnable frontends'', i.e., neural modules that produce a learnable time-frequency representation, to overcome limitations of fixed features. The second one uses self-supervised learning to leverage unprecedented scales of pre-training data. In this work, we study the feasibility of combining both approaches, i.e., pre-training learnable frontend jointly with the main architecture for downstream classification. First, we show that pretraining two previously proposed frontends (SincNet and LEAF) on Audioset drastically improves linear-probe performance over fixed mel-filterbanks, suggesting that learnable time-frequency representations can benefit self-supervised pre-training even more than supervised training. Surprisingly, randomly initialized learnable filterbanks outperform mel-scaled initialization in the self-supervised setting, a counter-intuitive result that questions the appropriateness of strong priors when designing learnable filters. Through exploratory analysis of the learned frontend components, we uncover crucial differences in properties of these frontends when used in a supervised and self-supervised setting, especially the affinity of self-supervised filters to diverge significantly from the mel-scale to model a broader range of frequencies",

Although high estimation accuracy has been achieved for clean speech, it is still challenging for F0 estimation to handle noisy speech, mainly because of the corruption of harmonic structure caused by noise. In this paper, we view F0 estimation as a multi-class classification problem and train a frequency-domain densely-connected convolutional neural network (DC-CRN) to estimate F0 from noisy speech. The proposed model significantly outperforms baseline methods in terms of detection rate. We find that using complex short-time Fourier transform (STFT) as input produces better performance compared to using magnitude STFT as input. Furthermore, we explore improving F0 estimation with speech enhancement. Although the F0 estimation model trained on clean speech performs well on enhanced speech, the distortion introduced by the speech enhancement model limits the estimation performance. We propose a cascade model which consists of two modules that optimize enhanced speech and estimated F0 in turn.

Deep neural network based non-intrusive MOS estimation models have recently emerged as a popular cost-efficient alternative to these tests. These models are trained with only the MOS labels, often discarding the secondary statistics of the opinion scores. In this paper, we investigate several ways to integrate the distribution of opinion scores (e.g. variance, histogram information) to improve the MOS estimation performance. Our model is trained on a corpus of 419K denoised samples by 320 different DNS models and model variations and evaluated on 18K test samples from DNSMOS. We show that with very minor modification of a single task MOS estimation pipeline, these freely available labels can provide up to a 0.016 RMSE and 1% SRCC improvement",

    "title": "Deep versus Wide: An Analysis of Student Architectures for Task-Agnostic Knowledge Distillation of Self-Supervised Speech Models",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Self-supervised learning (SSL) is seen as a very promising approach with high performance for several speech downstream tasks. Since the parameters of SSL models are generally so large that training and inference require a lot of memory and computational cost, it is desirable to produce compact SSL models without a significant performance degradation by applying compression methods such as knowledge distillation (KD). Although the KD approach is able to shrink the depth and/or width of SSL model structures, there has been little research on how varying the depth and width impacts the internal representation of the small-footprint model. This paper provides an empirical study that addresses the question. We investigate the performance on SUPERB while varying the structure and KD methods so as to keep the number of parameters constant; this allows us to analyze the contribution of the representation introduced by varying the model architecture. Experiments demonstrate that a certain depth is essential for solving content-oriented tasks (e.g. automatic speech recognition) accurately, whereas a certain width is necessary for achieving high performance on several speaker-oriented tasks (e.g. speaker identification). Based on these observations, we identify, for SUPERB, a more compressed model with better performance than previous studies",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "The performance of neural anti-spoofing models has rapidly improved in recent years due to larger network architectures and better training methodologies. However, these systems require considerable training data for achieving high performance, which makes it challenging to train them in compute-restricted environments. To make these systems accessible in resource-constrained environments, we consider the task of training neural anti-spoofing models with limited training data. We apply multiple dataset pruning techniques to the ASVspoof 2019 dataset for selecting the most informative training examples and pruning a significant chunk of the data with minimal decrease in performance. We find that the existing pruning metrics are not simultaneously granular and stable. To address this problem and further improve the performance of anti-spoofing models on pruned data, we propose a new metric, Forgetting Norm, to score individual training examples with higher granularity. Extensive experiments on two anti-spoofing models, AASIST-L and RawNet2, and several pruning settings demonstrate up to 23% relative improvement with forgetting norm over other baseline pruning heuristics. We also demonstrate the desirable properties of the proposed metric by analyzing the training landscape of the neural anti-spoofing models",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "For text-to-speech (TTS) synthesis, prosodic structure prediction (PSP) plays an important role in producing natural and intelligible speech. Although inter-utterance linguistic information can influence the speech interpretation of the target utterance, previous works on PSP mainly focus on utilizing intrautterance linguistic information of the current utterance only. This work proposes to use inter-utterance linguistic information to improve the performance of PSP. Multi-level contextual information, which includes both inter-utterance and intrautterance linguistic information, is extracted by a hierarchical encoder from character level, utterance level and discourse level of the input text. Then a multi-task learning (MTL) decoder predicts prosodic boundaries from multi-level contextual information. Objective evaluation results on two datasets show that our method achieves better F1 scores in predicting prosodic word (PW), prosodic phrase (PPH) and intonational phrase (IPH). It demonstrates the effectiveness of using multi-level contextual information for PSP. Subjective preference tests also indicate the naturalness of synthesized speeches are improved",

In this paper, we propose a Chinese polyphone BERT model to predict the pronunciations of Chinese polyphonic characters. Firstly, we create 741 new Chinese monophonic characters from 354 source Chinese polyphonic characters by pronunciation. Then we get a Chinese polyphone BERT by extending a pre-trained Chinese BERT with 741 new Chinese monophonic characters and adding a corresponding embedding layer for new tokens, which is initialized by the embeddings of source Chinese polyphonic characters. In this way, we can turn the polyphone disambiguation task into a pre-training task of the Chinese polyphone BERT. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model, and the polyphone BERT model obtain 2% (from 92.1% to 94.1%) improvement of average accuracy compared with the BERT-based classifier model, which is the prior state-of-the-art in polyphone disambiguation",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "End-to-end TTS requires a large amount of speech/text paired data to cover all necessary knowledge, particularly how to pronounce different words in diverse contexts, so that a neural model may learn such knowledge accordingly. But in real applications, such high demand of training data is hard to be satisfied and additional knowledge often needs to be injected manually. For example, to capture pronunciation knowledge on languages without regular orthography, a complicated grapheme-to-phoneme pipeline needs to be built based on a large structured pronunciation lexicon, leading to extra, sometimes high, costs to extend neural TTS to such languages. In this paper, we propose a framework to learn to automatically extract knowledge from unstructured external resources using a novel Token2Knowledge attention module. The framework is applied to build a TTS model named Neural Lexicon Reader that extracts pronunciations from raw lexicon texts in an end-to-end manner. Experiments show the proposed model significantly reduces pronunciation errors in low-resource, end-to-end Chinese TTS, and the lexicon-reading capability can be transferred to other languages with a smaller amount of data",

Pairwise comparison with monolingual models in these languages suggests that multilingual ByT5 models generally lower the phone error rate by jointly learning from a variety of languages. The pretrained model can further benefit low resource G2P through zero-shot prediction on unseen languages or provides pretrained weights for finetuning, which helps the model converge to a lower phone error rate than randomly initialized weights.

    "abstract": "Recently, leveraging BERT pre-training to improve the phoneme encoder in text to speech (TTS) has drawn increasing attention. However, the works apply pre-training with character-based units to enhance the TTS phoneme encoder, which is inconsistent with the TTS fine-tuning that takes phonemes as input. Pre-training only with phonemes as input can alleviate the input mismatch but lack the ability to model rich representations and sematic information due to limited phoneme vocabulary. In this paper, we propose Mixed-Phoneme BERT, a novel variant of the BERT model that uses mixed phoneme and sup-phoneme representations to enhance the learning capability. Specifically, we merge the adjacent phonemes into sup-phonemes and combine the phoneme sequence and the merged sup-phoneme sequence as the model input, which can enhance the model capacity to learn rich contextual representations. Experiment results demonstrate that our proposed Mixed-Phoneme BERT significantly improves the TTS performance with 0.30 CMOS gain compared with the FastSpeech 2 baseline.

A parallel end-to-end speech like VITS can generate the audio with high MOS comparable to ground truth and achieve low latency on GPU. However, the VITS still has high latency when synthesizing long utterances on CPUs. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a streaming method for the parallel speech synthesis model like VITS to synthesize with the long texts effectively on CPU. Our system has achieved human-like speech quality in both the non-streaming and streaming mode on the in-house Vietnamese evaluation set, while the synthesis speed of our system is approximately four times faster than that of the VITS in the non-streaming mode. Furthermore, the customer perceived latency of our system in streaming mode is 25 times faster than the VITS on computer CPU. Our system in non-streaming mode achieves a MOS of 4.43 compared to ground-truth with MOS 4.56; it also has high-quality speech with a MOS of 4.35 in streaming mode.

We explore both attention and recurrent neural nets to account for the fact that stimuli in a pair are not time aligned. To obtain a large training set we convert listeners' ratings from MUSHRA tests to values that reflect how often one stimulus in the pair was rated higher than the other.

This paper proposes SoundChoice, a novel G2P architecture that processes entire sentences rather than operating at the word level. The proposed architecture takes advantage of a weighted homograph loss (that improves disambiguation), exploits curriculum learning (that gradually switches from wordlevel to sentence-level G2P), and integrates word embeddings from BERT (for further performance improvement). Moreover, the model inherits the best practices in speech recognition, including multi-task learning with Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) and beam search with an embedded language model.

We hypothesize that the information about the speaker's facial muscle movements is expressed in the generated speech and can somehow be predicted from speech alone. To verify this, we devise a neural network model that predicts an AU sequence from the mel-spectrogram of input speech and train it using a large-scale audio-visual dataset consisting of many speaking face-tracks. We call our method and model ``crossmodal AU sequence estimation/estimator (CAUSE)''. We implemented several of the most basic architectures for CAUSE, and quantitatively confirmed that the fully convolutional architecture performed best. Furthermore, by combining CAUSE with an AU-conditioned image-to-image translation method, we implemented a system that animates a given still face image from speech.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "With the recent developments in speech synthesis via machine learning, this study explores incorporating linguistics knowledge to visualise and evaluate synthetic speech model training. If changes to the first and second formant (in turn, the vowel space) can be seen and heard in synthetic speech, this knowledge can inform speech synthesis technology developers. A speech synthesis model trained on a large General American English database was fine-tuned into a New Zealand English voice to identify if the changes in the vowel space of synthetic speech could be seen and heard. The vowel spaces at different intervals during the fine-tuning were analysed to determine if the model learned the New Zealand English vowel space. Our findings based on vowel space analysis show that we can visualise how a speech synthesis model learns the vowel space of the database it is trained on. Perception tests confirmed that humans could perceive when a speech synthesis model has learned characteristics of the speech database it is training on. Using the vowel space as an intermediary evaluation helps understand what sounds are to be added to the training database and build speech synthesis models based on linguistics knowledge",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Deep neural networks have significantly improved performance on a range of tasks with the increasing demand for computational resources, leaving deployment on low-resource devices (with limited memory and battery power) infeasible. Binary neural networks (BNNs) tackle the issue to an extent with extreme compression and speed-up gains compared to real-valued models. We propose a simple but effective method to accelerate inference through unifying BNNs with an early-exiting strategy. Our approach allows simple instances to exit early based on a decision threshold and utilizes output layers added to different intermediate layers to avoid executing the entire binary model. We extensively evaluate our method on three audio classification tasks and across four BNNs architectures. Our method demonstrates favorable quality-efficiency trade-offs while being controllable with an entropy-based threshold specified by the system user. It also results in better speed-ups (latency less than 6ms) with a single model based on existing BNN architectures without retraining for different efficiency levels. It also provides a straightforward way to estimate sample difficulty and better understanding of uncertainty around certain classes within the dataset",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "This paper presents a streaming speaker-attributed automatic speech recognition (SA-ASR) model that can recognize ``who spoke what'' with low latency even when multiple people are speaking simultaneously. Our model is based on token-level serialized output training (t-SOT) which was recently proposed to transcribe multi-talker speech in a streaming fashion. To further recognize speaker identities, we propose an encoder-decoder based speaker embedding extractor that can estimate a speaker representation for each recognized token not only from non-overlapping speech but also from overlapping speech. The proposed speaker embedding, named t-vector, is extracted synchronously with the t-SOT ASR model, enabling joint execution of speaker identification (SID) or speaker diarization (SD) with the multi-talker transcription with low latency. We evaluate the proposed model for a joint task of ASR and SID/SD by using LibriSpeechMix and LibriCSS corpora. The proposed model achieves substantially better accuracy than a prior streaming model and shows comparable or sometimes even superior results to the state-of-the-art offline SA-ASR model",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we investigate the semi-supervised joint training of text to speech (TTS) and automatic speech recognition (ASR), where a small amount of paired data and a large amount of unpaired text data are available. Conventional studies form a cycle called the TTS-ASR pipeline, where the multi-speaker TTS model synthesizes speech from text with a reference speech and the ASR model reconstructs the text from the synthesized speech, after which both models are trained with a cycle-consistency loss. However, the synthesized speech does not reflect the speaker characteristics of the reference speech and the synthesized speech becomes overly easy for the ASR model to recognize after training. This not only decreases the TTS model quality but also limits the ASR model improvement. To solve this problem, we propose improving the cycle-consistency-based training with a speaker consistency loss and step-wise optimization. The speaker consistency loss brings the speaker characteristics of the synthesized speech closer to that of the reference speech. In the step-wise optimization, we first freeze the parameter of the TTS model before both models are trained to avoid over-adaptation of the TTS model to the ASR model. Experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method",

In this paper, we propose Prototype-based Co-Adaptation with Transformer (Proto-CAT), a multi-modal generalized few-shot learning (GFSL) method for AVSR systems. In other words, Proto-CAT learns to recognize a novel class multi-modal object with few-shot training data, while maintaining its ability on those base closed-set categories. The main idea is to transform the prototypes (i.e., class centers) by incorporating cross-modality complementary information and calibrating cross-category semantic differences. In particular, Proto-CAT co-adapts the embeddings from audio-visual and category levels, so that it generalizes its predictions on all categories dynamically. Proto-CAT achieves state-of-the-art performance on various AVSR-GFSL benchmarks. The code is available at https://github.com/ZhangYikaii/Proto-CAT",

    "abstract": "Cross-device federated learning (FL) protects user privacy by collaboratively training a model on user devices, therefore eliminating the need for collecting, storing, and manually labeling user data. Previous works have considered cross-device FL for automatic speech recognition (ASR), however, there are a few important challenges that havenot been fully addressed. These include the lack of ground-truth ASR transcriptions, and the scarcity of compute resource and network bandwidth on edge devices. In this paper, we address these two challenges. First, we propose a federated learning system to support on-device ASR adaptation with full self-supervision, which uses self-labeling together with data augmentation and filtering techniques. The proposed system can improve a strong Emformer-Transducer based ASR model pretrained on out-of-domain data, using in-domain audios without any ground-truth transcriptions. Second, to reduce the training cost, we propose a self-restricted RNN Transducer (SR-RNN-T) loss, a new variant of alignment-restricted RNN-T that uses Viterbi forced-alignment from self-supervision. To further reduce the compute and network cost, we systematically explore adapting only a subset of weights in the Emformer-Transducer. Our best training recipe achieves a 12.9% relative WER reduction over the strong out-of-domain baseline, which equals 70% of the reduction achievable with full human supervision and centralized training",

It converts numbers, dates, abbreviations, and other semiotic classes from the spoken form generated by ASR to their written forms. One can consider ITN as a Machine Translation task and use neural sequence-to-sequence models to solve it. Unfortunately, such neural models are prone to hallucinations that could lead to unacceptable errors. To mitigate this issue, we propose a single-pass token classifier model that regards ITN as a tagging task. The model assigns a replacement fragment to every input token or marks it for deletion or copying without changes. We present a method of dataset preparation, based on granular alignment of ITN examples. The proposed model is less prone to hallucination errors. The model is trained on the Google Text Normalization dataset and achieves state-of-the-art sentence accuracy on both English and Russian test sets. One-to-one correspondence between tags and input words improves the interpretability of the model's predictions, simplifies debugging, and allows for post-processing corrections.

    "abstract": "In this paper, we conduct a comparative study on speaker-attributed automatic speech recognition (SA-ASR) in the multi-party meeting scenario, a topic with increasing attention in meeting rich transcription. Specifically, three approaches are evaluated in this study. The first approach, FD-SOT, consists of a frame-level diarization model to identify speakers and a multi-talker ASR to recognize utterances. The speaker-attributed transcriptions are obtained by aligning the diarization results and recognized hypotheses. However, such an alignment strategy may suffer from erroneous timestamps due to the modular independence, severely hindering the model performance. Therefore, we propose the second approach, WD-SOT, to address alignment errors by introducing a word-level diarization model, which can get rid of such timestamp alignment dependency. To further mitigate the alignment issues, we propose the third approach, TS-ASR, which trains a target-speaker separation module and an ASR module jointly. By comparing various strategies for each SA-ASR approach, experimental results on a real meeting scenario corpus, AliMeeting, reveal that the WD-SOT approach achieves 10.7% relative reduction on averaged speaker-dependent character error rate (SD-CER), compared with the FD-SOT approach. In addition, the TS-ASR approach also outperforms the FD-SOT approach and brings 16.5% relative average SD-CER reduction",

    "abstract": "Real-time communications in packet-switched networks have become widely used in daily communication, while they inevitably suffer from network delays and data losses in constrained real-time conditions. To solve these problems, audio packet loss concealment (PLC) algorithms have been developed to mitigate voice transmission failures by reconstructing the lost information. Limited by the transmission latency and device memory, it is still intractable for PLC to accomplish high-quality voice reconstruction using a relatively small packet buffer. In this paper, we propose a temporal memory generative adversarial network for audio PLC, dubbed TMGAN-PLC, which is comprised of a novel nested-UNet generator and the time-domain/frequency-domain discriminators. Specifically, a combination of the nested-UNet and temporal feature-wise linear modulation is elaborately devised in the generator to finely adjust the intra-frame information and establish inter-frame temporal dependencies. To complement the missing speech content caused by longer loss bursts, we employ multi-stage gated vector quantizers to capture the correct content and reconstruct the near-real smooth audio. Extensive experiments on the PLC Challenge dataset demonstrate that the proposed method yields promising performance in terms of speech quality, intelligibility, and PLCMOS",

Various studies have used separate pretrained enhancement models as the front-end module of the SV system in noisy environments, and these methods effectively remove noises. However, the denoising process of independent enhancement models not tailored to the SV task can also distort the speaker information included in utterances. We argue that the enhancement network and speaker embedding extractor should be fully jointly trained for SV tasks under noisy conditions to alleviate this issue. Therefore, we proposed a U-Net-based integrated framework that simultaneously optimizes speaker identification and feature enhancement losses. Moreover, we analyzed the structural limitations of using U-Net directly for noise SV tasks and further proposed Extended U-Net to reduce these drawbacks. We evaluated the models on the noise-synthesized VoxCeleb1 test set and VOiCES development set recorded in various noisy scenarios.

    "abstract": "The emergence of large-margin softmax cross-entropy losses in training deep speaker embedding neural networks has triggered a gradual shift from parametric back-ends to a simpler cosine similarity measure for speaker verification. Popular parametric back-ends include the probabilistic linear discriminant analysis (PLDA) and its variants. This paper investigates the properties of margin-based cross-entropy losses leading to such a shift and aims to find scoring back-ends best suited for speaker verification. In addition, we revisit the pre-processing techniques which have been widely used in the past and assess their effectiveness on large-margin embeddings. Experiments on the state-of-the-art ECAPA-TDNN networks trained with various large-margin softmax cross-entropy losses show a substantial increment in intra-speaker compactness making the conventional PLDA superfluous. In this regard, we found that constraining the within-speaker covariance matrix could improve the performance of the PLDA. It is demonstrated through a series of experiments on the VoxCeleb-1 and SITW core-core test sets with 40.8% equal error rate (EER) reduction and 35.1% minimum detection cost (minDCF) reduction.

    "abstract": "Deep speaker embeddings have been shown to encode a wide variety of attributes relating to a speaker. The aim of this work is to separate out some of these attributes in the embedding space, disentangling these sources of speaker variation into subsets of the embedding dimensions. This is achieved modifying the training procedure of a typical speaker embedding network, which is typically only trained to classify speakers. This work instead adds pairs of attribute specific task heads to operate on complementary subsets of the speaker embedding dimensions. While specific dimensions are encouraged to encode an attribute, for example gender, the other dimensions are penalized for containing this information using an adversarial loss. We show that this method is effective in factorizing out multiple attributes in the embedding space, successfully disentangling gender, nationality and age. Using the disentangled representations, we investigate how much removing this information impacts speaker verification and diarization performance, showing that gender is a significant source of separation in the deep speaker embedding space, with nationality and age also contributing to a lesser degree",

The usual practice is to learn domain adaptation and bandwidth extension models independently. Contrary to this, we propose to learn both tasks together.

We developed parallel and non-parallel learning solutions which utilize both paired and unpaired data. We first discuss joint and disjoint training of multiple generative models for our tasks. Then, we propose a two-stage learning solution using a pre-trained domain adaptation system for pre-processing in bandwidth extension training. We evaluated our schemes on a Speaker Verification downstream task. We used the JHU-MIT experimental setup for NIST SRE21, which comprises SRE16, SRE-CTS Superset, and SRE21. Our results prove that learning both tasks is better than learning just one.

In this study, we reconstructed the vocal tract geometry with three repetitive magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) on the same subject and investigated the effects of coronal vocal tract shapes on the airflow and sound characteristics in [ç]. The computational grids were constructed on each vocal tract and a numerical airflow simulation was conducted to predict the turbulent airflow and aeroacoustic sound generation. The predicted sound properties were in good agreement with the measurement of Japanese subjects. The comparison of the airflow and acoustic characteristics among three vocal tracts showed that the slight changes of the constriction area and flow channel downstream from the constriction influenced the sound source generation and peak amplitudes at around 3 kHz, indicating that the characteristic peak of [ç] was variable due to the constriction shape at the middle part of the hard palate",

Recently, transformer-based AAI models have been shown to achieve state-of-art performance. However, in transformer networks, the attention is applied over the whole utterance, thereby needing to obtain the full utterance before the inference, which leads to high latency and is impractical for streaming AAI. To enable streaming during inference, evaluation could be performed on non-overlapping chucks instead of full utterance. However, due to a mismatch of attention receptive field during training and evaluation, there could be a drop in AAI performance. To overcome this scenario, in this work we perform experiments with different attention masks and use context from previous predictions during training. Experiments results revealed that using the random start mask attention with the context from previous predictions of transformer encoder performs better than the baseline results",

In our OFC model commands are estimated via the minimisation of a cost that combines neuromuscular effort, and a penalty on accuracy of the auditory patterns reached for the phonemes. The biomechanics of the plant are implemented by an LSTM trained on simulations of a finite element model of the tongue.

The current study investigates the acoustics and articulation of allophonic variations in English laterals produced by Japanese speakers, focusing on the effects of syllabic positions and flanking vowels. Acoustic and articulatory data were obtained from five Japanese speakers in a simultaneous audio and high-speed ultrasound tongue imaging recording set-up while they read sentences containing syllable-initial and -final tokens of English /l/ in four different vowel contexts. Acoustic analysis was conducted on 500 tokens using linear-mixed effects modelling and the articulatory data were analysed using generalised additive mixed modelling. Syllable position and vowel context had significant effects on acoustics, while midsagittal tongue shape was more influenced by vowel context, with fewer positional effects. The results demonstrate that differences in acoustics not always be mirrored exactly by midsagittal tongue shape, suggesting multidimensionality of articulation in second language speech",

Our work introduces SAQAM which uses a multi-task learning framework to assess listening quality (LQ) and spatialization quality (SQ) between any given pair of binaural signals without using any subjective data. We model LQ by training on a simulated dataset of triplet human judgments, and SQ by utilizing activation-level distances from networks trained for direction of arrival (DOA) estimation. We show that SAQAM correlates well with human responses across four diverse datasets. Since it is a deep network, the metric is differentiable, making it suitable as a loss function for other tasks.

We found that making scientific visualization by animating these plots enables us to understand different pitch extractors' behavior at once. Such efficient and effortless inspection is impossible by inspecting all individual plots. The proposed measurement method with visualization leads to further improvement of the performance of one of the extractors mentioned above.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Fake audio detection (FAD) is a technique to distinguish synthetic speech from natural speech. In most FAD systems, removing irrelevant features from acoustic speech while keeping only robust discriminative features is essential. Intuitively, speaker information entangled in acoustic speech should be suppressed for the FAD task. Particularly in a deep neural network (DNN)-based FAD system, the learning system may learn speaker information from a training dataset and cannot generalize well on a testing dataset. In this paper, we propose to use the speaker anonymization (SA) technique to suppress speaker information from acoustic speech before inputting it into a DNN-based FAD system. We adopted the McAdams-coefficient-based SA (MC-SA) algorithm, and this is expected that the entangled speaker information will not be involved in the DNN-based FAD learning. Based on this idea, we implemented a light convolutional neural network bidirectional long short-term memory (LCNN-BLSTM)-based FAD system and conducted experiments on the Audio Deep Synthesis Detection Challenge (ADD2022) datasets. The results showed that removing the speaker information from acoustic speech improved the relative performance in the first track of ADD2022 by 17.66%",

Now, selecting the most relevant augmentations has proven crucial for better downstream performances. Thus, this work introduces a conditional independance-based method which allows for automatically selecting a suitable distribution on the choice of augmentations and their parametrization from a set of predefined ones, for contrastive self-supervised pre-training. This is performed with respect to a downstream task of interest, hence saving a costly hyper-parameter search. Experiments performed on two different downstream tasks validate the proposed approach showing better results than experimenting without augmentation or with baseline augmentations.

However, such corpora have properties that hinder downstream performance, including being (1) too large, (2) beset with domain-mismatched content, and (3) heavy-headed rather than heavy-tailed (excessively many duplicate search queries such as \"weather\"). We show that three simple strategies for selecting language modeling data can dramatically improve rare-word recognition without harming overall performance. First, to address the heavy-headedness, we downsample the data according to a soft log function, which tunably reduces high frequency (head) sentences. Second, to encourage rare-word exposure, we explicitly filter for words rare in the acoustic data. Finally, we tackle domain-mismatch via perplexity-based contrastive selection, filtering for examples matched to the target domain. We down-select a large corpus of web search queries by a factor of 53x and achieve better LM perplexities than without down-selection. When shallow-fused with a state-of-the-art, production speech engine, our LM achieves WER reductions of up to 24\\% relative on rare-word sentences (without changing overall WER) compared to a baseline LM trained on the raw corpus.

In order to bridge the research gap, we take the bidirectional encoder representations from Transformers (BERT) model as an example to explore novel uses of a pre-trained model for language modeling. More formally, this paper proposes a set of BERT-based language models, and a neural-based dynamic adaptation method is also introduced to combine these language models systematically and methodically.

    "abstract": "This work investigates privacy-aware collaborative wake word detection (WWD) in acoustic sensor networks. To meet state-of-the-art privacy constraints, the proposed WWD scheme is based on privacy-aware unsupervised clustered federated learning that groups microphone nodes w.r.t. active sound sources and on a privacy-preserving high-level feature representation. Using the partition of microphone nodes into clusters, we apply intra- and inter-cluster feature enhancement strategies directly in the privacy-preserving feature domain and thus circumvent the need for communicating privacy-sensitive information between nodes. The approach is demonstrated for an acoustic sensor network deployed in a smart-home environment. We show that the proposed collaborative WWD system clearly outperforms independent decisions of individual microphone nodes.

Considering the scenario of a room equipped with a fixed smart speaker device with one or more microphones and a wearable smart device (watch, glasses or smartphone), we employed the improved proportionate normalized least mean square adaptive filter to estimate the relative room impulse response mapping the audio recordings of the two devices. We performed inter-device distance estimation by exploiting a new set of features obtained extending the definition of some acoustic attributes of the room impulse response to its relative version. In combination with the sparseness measure of the estimated relative room impulse response, the relative features allow precise inter-device distance estimation which can be exploited for tasks such as best microphone selection or acoustic scene analysis. Experimental results from simulated rooms of different dimensions and reverberation times demonstrate the effectiveness of this computationally lightweight approach for smart home acoustic ranging applications",

    "abstract": "Deep neural networks (DNNs) are very effective for multichannel speech enhancement with fixed array geometries. However, it is not trivial to use DNNs for ad-hoc arrays with unknown order and placement of microphones. We propose a novel triple-path network for ad-hoc array processing in the time domain. The key idea in the network design is to divide the overall processing into spatial processing and temporal processing and use self-attention for spatial processing. Using self-attention for spatial processing makes the network invariant to the order and the number of microphones. The temporal processing is done independently for all channels using a recently proposed dual-path attentive recurrent network. The proposed network is a multiple-input multiple-output architecture that can simultaneously enhance signals at all microphones. Experimental results demonstrate the excellent performance of the proposed approach. Further, we present analysis to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed network in utilizing multichannel information even from microphones at far locations",

To this end, five subjects produced a set of logatomes that contained German primary, secondary, and peripheral diphthongs in the context of bilabial and labiodental consonants at three different speaking rates. During the utterances, tongue movements were measured by means of optical palatography (OPG), i.e. by optical distance sensing in the oral cavity, along with the acoustic speech signal. The analysis of the movement signals revealed that the diphthongs have s-shaped tongue trajectories that strongly resemble half cosine periods. In addition, acoustic and articulatory diphthong durations have a linear, but not proportional, relationship. Finally, the peak velocity and midpoint between the two targets of a diphthong are reached in the middle of both the acoustic and articulatory diphthong time intervals, regardless of the duration and type of diphthong. These results can help to model realistic tongue movements for diphthongs in articulatory speech synthesis",

The results revealed that children aged nine years or younger realized /z/ as affricate significantly more than 13-year-old and adult speakers. Once the children reached 11 years of age, the difference compared to adults was not statistically significant, which denotes a similar developmental pattern as that of speech motor control (e.g., lip and jaw) and cognitive-linguistic skill. Moreover, we examined whether the developmental changes of allophonic realization of /z/ are due to speech rate and the time to articulate /z/. The results showed that the allophonic realization of /z/ is not affected by those factors, different from that of adults. We also found that the effects of speech rate and the time to articulate /z/ on the allophonic realization become adult-like at around 11 years of age",

However, the intelligibility of presented speech using BC headphones is degraded by BC transmission, especially in noisy environments. This paper proposes a method for improving the word intelligibility of presented BC speech under noisy conditions. The method consists of two types of emphasis: higher-frequency emphasis and consonant emphasis. In the higher-frequency emphasis, frequency components attenuated due to BC transmission were compensated by the inverse-filtering of the transfer function obtained from the regio-temporalis (RT) vibration or the EC radiated sound. In the consonant emphasis, consonant sections with 20-ms short-formant trajectories of subsequent vowels in speech signals were locally amplified by a constant gain. The results of word intelligibility tests showed that both types of emphasis had significant improvements in comparison with no-emphasis.

    "abstract": "The finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) method has been widely used for vocal tract acoustic modelling due to its simplicity and low computational cost. Nevertheless, the method suffers from high discretization error while approximating realistic vocal tract geometries using orthogonal grid elements. Alternatively, simplified vocal tract shapes having regular contours can be used for articulatory models. These geometries can be generated from one-dimensional (1D) area functions, which approximate vocal tracts as concatenated tubes with different cross-sections. To this aim, we modify an existing 3D FDTD model for faster acoustic simulation and synthesize five English vowels with various simplified vocal tract shapes. We implement six geometrical shapes for each vowel, consisting of circular, elliptical and square cross-sections with centric and eccentric tube segment configurations. Vowel transfer functions obtained from these FDTD simulations are compared with a highly accurate finite element (FE) scheme. The acoustic formants of the FDTD model agree well with the corresponding FEM approach for most vowels. The influence of vocal tracts with different geometry approximations remains insignificant for frequencies below $5$~kHz. However, vocal tracts with elliptical or eccentric configurations have produced higher-order acoustic modes. This paper characterizes the acoustic properties of simplified vocal tract shapes using the 3D FDTD scheme",

It happens automatically and unconsciously, but people can also deliberately imitate others when asked to do so. Here, we investigate to what degree people converge to their interlocutor in a scripted dialogue when they are and when they are not explicitly requested to imitate their interlocutor. More specifically, we collected two separate data sets, where Italian- and French-native participants read English sentences aloud in alternating speaking turns. The results of both groups with different language backgrounds were compared against each other. We used a Gaussian mixture model – universal background model (GMM-UBM) to assess phonetic convergence on the sentence level. The GMM-UBM configuration was optimized to make the best distinction between speakers on validation data. We found that people start to converge to one another while interacting compared to the baseline and even more substantially when explicitly asked to do so. Results are robust across data sets. More importantly, the degree of implicit convergence people display is related to how good of an explicit imitator they are, supporting the claim that the two phenomena are based on the same neurocognitive process",

Using articulatory modeling and deep learning, this study examines how this articulatory information can be used for discovering speech units in a self-supervised setting. We used vector-quantized variational autoencoders (VQ-VAE) to learn discrete representations from articulatory and acoustic speech data. In line with the zero-resource paradigm, an ABX test was then used to investigate how the extracted representations encode phonetically relevant properties. Experiments were conducted on three different corpora in English and French. We found that articulatory information rather organises the latent representations in terms of place of articulation whereas the speech acoustics mainly structure the latent space in terms of manner of articulation. We show that an optimal fusion of the two modalities can lead to a joint representation of these phonetic dimensions more accurate than each modality considered individually. Since articulatory information is usually not available in a practical situation, we finally investigate the benefit it provides when inferred from the speech acoustics in a self-supervised manner",

We carried out a perceptual training using a vowel identification task with /e/-/eu/ continuum. The speech sounds were accompanied with somatosensory stimulation, in which a facial skin-stretch was applied in the backward direction. The vowels /e/ and /eu/ were recorded prior to and following the training and the first three formants were compared. Results showed that the third formant of /e/ was increased following the training, and the rest of formant was not changed. Since the current somatosensory stimulation was related to the articulatory movement for the production of /e/ (lip-spreading), repetitive exposure to somatosensory stimulation in addition to the sound may specifically change the articulatory behavior for the production of /e/.

That makes the design of LPCNet-based systems more complicated, while adding the constraint that the input features must represent a clean speech spectrum. We propose an end-to-end version of LPCNet that lifts these limitations by learning to infer the LP coefficients from the input features in the frame rate network.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Neural models are known to be over-parameterized, and recent work has shown that sparse text-to-speech (TTS) models can outperform dense models. Although a plethora of sparse methods has been proposed for other domains, such methods have rarely been applied in TTS. In this work, we seek to answer the question: what are the characteristics of selected sparse techniques on the performance and model complexity? We compare a Tacotron2 baseline and the results of applying five techniques. We then evaluate the performance via the factors of naturalness, intelligibility and prosody, while reporting model size and training time. Complementary to prior research, we find that pruning before or during training can achieve similar performance to pruning after training and can be trained much faster, while removing entire neurons degrades performance much more than removing parameters. To our best knowledge, this is the first work that compares sparsity paradigms in text-to-speech synthesis",

    "abstract": "A text-to-speech (TTS) model typically factorizes speech attributes such as content, speaker and prosody into disentangled representations. Recent works aim to additionally model the acoustic conditions explicitly, in order to disentangle the primary speech factors, i.e. linguistic content, prosody and timbre from any residual factors, such as recording conditions and background noise. This paper proposes unsupervised, interpretable and fine-grained noise and prosody modeling. We incorporate adversarial training, representation bottleneck and utterance-to-frame modeling in order to learn frame-level noise representations. To the same end, we perform fine-grained prosody modeling via a Fully Hierarchical Variational AutoEncoder (FVAE) which additionally results in more expressive speech synthesis.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Recent advances in neural text-to-speech research have been dominated by two-stage pipelines utilizing low-level intermediate speech representation such as mel-spectrograms. However, such predetermined features are fundamentally limited, because they do not allow to exploit the full potential of a data-driven approach through learning hidden representations. For this reason, several end-to-end methods have been proposed. However, such models are harder to train and require a large number of high-quality recordings with transcriptions. Here, we propose WavThruVec - a two-stage architecture that resolves the bottleneck by using high-dimensional wav2vec 2.0 embeddings as intermediate speech representation. Since these hidden activations provide high-level linguistic features, they are more robust to noise. That allows us to utilize annotated speech datasets of a lower quality to train the first-stage module. At the same time, the second-stage component can be trained on large-scale untranscribed audio corpora, as wav2vec 2.0 embeddings are already time-aligned. This results in an increased generalization capability to out-of-vocabulary words, as well as to a better generalization to unseen speakers. We show that the proposed model not only matches the quality of state-of-the-art neural models, but also presents useful properties enabling tasks like voice conversion or zero-shot synthesis",

    "abstract": "We propose a simple and easy-to-apply unsupervised training method for multi-channel deep separation models used in sound source separation. Such models require a large amount of training data, i.e., source signals and their mixtures. A previous method uses pseudo-target source signals, which can be obtained as the outputs of blind source separation (BSS) based on statistical models in place of ground-truth source signals. However, the model performance of the previous method is degraded by some pseudo-targets that are inadequately separated by BSS. To exploit the reliable part of BSS, we select and remix well-separated signals included in the BSS result. In the selection step, we choose well-separated signals using the direction of arrival (DOA). As a criterion that addresses the quality of the separated signals, we adopted the minimum angular difference of DOA between source signals. In the remixing step, we introduce resampling of the DOA, which generates mixtures composed of source signals with both wide and narrow angular differences. These mixtures are not simply given by BSS and allow the deep separation model to learn both spectral and spatial information. In our experiment, our method's model performance was improved for mixture signals composed of the sources from various angles",

    "abstract": "Time-domain audio separation network (TasNet) has achieved remarkable performance in blind source separation (BSS). Classic multi-channel speech processing framework employs signal estimation and beamforming. For example, Beam-TasNet links multi-channel convolutional TasNet (MC-Conv-TasNet) with minimum variance distortionless response (MVDR) beamforming, which leverages the strong modeling ability of data-driven network and boosts the performance of beamforming with an accurate estimation of speech statistics. Such integration can be viewed as a directed acyclic graph by accepting multi-channel input and generating multi-source output. In this paper, we design a \"multi-channel input, multi-channel multi-source output'' (MIMMO) speech separation system entitled \"Beam-Guided TasNet'', where MC-Conv-TasNet and MVDR can interact and promote each other more compactly under a directed cyclic flow. Specifically, the first stage uses Beam-TasNet to generate estimated single-speaker signals, which favors the separation in the second stage. The proposed framework facilitates iterative signal refinement with the guide of beamforming and seeks to reach the upper bound of the MVDR-based methods. Experimental results on the spatialized WSJ0-2MIX demonstrate that the Beam-Guided TasNet has achieved an SDR of 21.5 dB, exceeding the baseline Beam-TasNet by 4.1 dB under the same model size and narrowing the gap with the oracle signal-based MVDR to 2 dB",

To exploit the real useful information behind these two modalities, we define two key correlations which are: (1) identity correlation (between timbre and facial attributes); (2) phonetic correlation (between phoneme and lip motion). These two correlations together comprise the complete information, which shows a certain superiority in separating target speaker's voice especially in some hard cases, such as the same gender or similar content. For implementation, contrastive learning or adversarial training approach is applied to maximize these two correlations. Both of them work well, while adversarial training shows its advantage by avoiding some limitations of contrastive learning.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Recent neural network based Direction of Arrival (DoA) estimation algorithms have performed well on unknown number of sound sources scenarios. These algorithms are usually achieved by mapping the multi-channel audio input to the single output (i.e. overall spatial pseudo-spectrum (SPS) of all sources), that is called MISO. However, such MISO algorithms strongly depend on empirical threshold setting and the angle assumption that the angles between the sound sources are greater than a fixed angle. To address these limitations, we propose a novel multi-channel input and multiple outputs DoA network called MIMO-DoAnet. Unlike the general MISO algorithms, MIMO-DoAnet predicts the SPS coding of each sound source with the help of the informative spatial covariance matrix. By doing so, the threshold task of detecting the number of sound sources becomes an easier task of detecting whether there is a sound source in each output, and the serious interaction between sound sources disappears during inference stage. Experimental results show that MIMO-DoAnet achieves relative 18.6% and absolute 13.3%, relative 34.4% and absolute 20.2% F1 score improvement compared with the MISO baseline system in 3, 4 sources scenes.

For the practical problem of unknown number of sources, existing localization algorithms attempt to predict a likelihood-based coding (i.e., spatial spectrum) and employ a pre-determined threshold to detect the source number and corresponding DOA value. However, these threshold-based algorithms are not stable since they are limited by the careful choice of threshold. To address this problem, we propose an iterative sound source localization approach called ISSL, which can iteratively extract each source's DOA without threshold until the termination criterion is met. Unlike threshold-based algorithms, ISSL designs an active source detector network based on binary classifier to accept residual spatial spectrum and decide whether to stop the iteration. By doing so, our ISSL can deal with an arbitrary number of sources, even more than the number of sources seen during the training stage. The experimental results show that our ISSL achieves significant performance improvements in both DOA estimation and source number detection compared with the existing threshold-based algorithms",

TRUNet consists of a spatial processing network with an attention mechanism across microphone channels aiming at capturing the spatial diversity, and a spectro-temporal processing network aiming at capturing spectral and temporal diversities. In addition to multi-channel filters, we also consider estimating single-channel filters from multi-channel input spectra using TRUNet. We train the network on a large reverberant dataset using a proposed combined compressed mean-squared error loss function, which further improves the sound separation performance.

This paper proposes a new approach, named PercepNet+, to further extend the PercepNet with four significant improvements. First, we introduce a phase-aware structure to leverage the phase information into PercepNet, by adding the complex features and complex subband gains as the deep network input and output respectively. Then, a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) estimator and an SNR-switched post-processing are specially designed to alleviate the over attenuation (OA) that appears in high SNR conditions of the original PercepNet. Moreover, the GRU layer is replaced by TF-GRU to model both temporal and frequency dependencies. Finally, we propose to integrate the loss of complex subband gain, SNR, pitch filtering strength, and an OA loss in a multi-objective learning manner to further improve the speech enhancement performance. Experimental results show that, the proposed PercepNet+ outperforms the original PercepNet significantly in terms of both PESQ and STOI, without increasing the model size too much",

    "abstract": "Recent studies in deep learning based real-time speech enhancement have proven the advantage of sub-band processing in parameter reduction. However, most sub-band based methods utilize the same model for all sub-bands, which limits the upper bound of performance, giving the fact that the spectral patterns in each sub-band are different. In this paper, we take into account this fact and propose a lightweight full-band and sub-band fusion network, where dual-branch based architecture is employed for modeling local and global spectral pattern simultaneously. A simple yet effective sub-band module, the weighted progressive convolutional module, is designed with a small number of parameters, which captures clean features progressively from local perspective. Each sub-band is handled by one module. A novel asymmetric convolutional recurrent network is also proposed to focus on full-band context and extract more robust global features, which is complementary to the sub-band module. We have conducted extensive experiments on both the VoiceBank+Demand and the DNS Challenge datasets, and the experimental results show that our proposed method has achieved superior performance to other state-of-the-art approaches with smaller model size and lower latency",

However, good model performance usually leads to a huge amount of parameters and extremely high computational complexity which greatly limit the use cases of deep learning models, particularly in embedded systems. Therefore, model compression is getting more and more attention. In this paper, we propose a compression strategy based on iterative pruning and knowledge distillation. Specifically, in each iteration, we first utilize a pruning criterion to drop the weights which have less impact on performance. Then, the model before pruning is used as a teacher to fine-tune the student which is the model after pruning. After several iterations, we get the final compressed model. The proposed method is verified on gated convolutional recurrent network (GCRN) and long short-term memory (LSTM) for single-channel speech enhancement task.

However, neural networks can not process a complex-valued feature, i.e., the STFT of a noisy speech. Therefore, these methods estimating the STFT of a clean signal can only obtain sub-optimal solutions. To avoid tackling complex-value operations, we formulate that only the real part of 2K-point STFT is utilized as the feature that holds all signal information. Therefore, speech enhancement in the STFT domain turns into a real-valued task. However, it is hard for the network to estimate the correct sign. Consequently, we develop an estimator to predict the real part sign and a decoder to estimate the targeted real part's mask.

GLD blocks capture long-term dependency of time-frequency bins both in global level and local level from the noisy spectrogram to help detecting correlations among speech part, noise part, and whole noisy input.

Typical methods focus on predicting clean speech spectrum via a naive convolution neural network-based encoder-decoder architecture, and these methods a) are not adequate to use data fully, b) are unable to effectively balance audio-visual features. The proposed model alleviates these drawbacks by a) applying a model that fuses audio and visual features layer by layer in the encoding phase, that feeds fused audio-visual features to each corresponding decoder layer, and more importantly, b) introducing 2-stage multi-head cross attention (MHCA) mechanism to infer audio-visual speech enhancement for balancing the fused audio-visual features and eliminating irrelevant features.

Furthermore, we set the constraints to be able to perform the SE process in real time, thereby designing OSSEM as a causal SE system.

One major difficulty of target speech extraction lies in handling variability in ``intra-speaker'' characteristics, i.e., characteristics mismatch between target speech and an enrollment utterance. While most conventional approaches focus on improving average performance given a set of enrollment utterances, here we propose to guarantee the worst performance, which we believe is of great practical importance. In this work, we propose an evaluation metric called worst-enrollment source-to-distortion ratio (SDR) to quantitatively measure the robustness towards enrollment variations. We also introduce a novel training scheme that aims at directly optimizing the worst-case performance by focusing on training with difficult enrollment cases where extraction does not perform well. In addition, we investigate the effectiveness of auxiliary speaker identification loss (SI-loss) as another way to improve robustness over enrollments. Experimental validation reveals the effectiveness of both worst-enrollment target training and SI-loss training to improve robustness against enrollment variations, by increasing speaker discriminability",

    "abstract": "Leveraging context information is an intuitive idea to improve performance on conversational automatic speech recognition (ASR). Previous works usually adopt recognized hypotheses of historical utterances as preceding context, which may bias the current recognized hypothesis due to the inevitable historical recognition errors. To avoid this problem, we propose an audio-textual cross-modal representation extractor to learn contextual representations directly from preceding speech. Specifically, it consists of two modal-related encoders, extracting high-level latent features from speech or text, and a cross-modal encoder, which aims to learn the correlation between speech and text. For each modal-related encoder, we randomly mask some tokens of its input or the whole input sequence, then we perform a token-missing or modal-missing prediction and a modal-level CTC loss on cross-modal encoder. Thus, the model captures not only the bi-directional context dependencies in a specific modality but also relationships between different modalities. Then, the extractor will be frozen to extract the textual representations of preceding speech during the training of the conversational ASR system through attention mechanism. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is validated on several Mandarin conversation corpora and the highest character error rate (CER) reduction up to 16% is achieved on the MagicData dataset",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Consonant and vowel reduction are often encountered in speech, which might cause performance degradation in automatic speech recognition (ASR). Our recently proposed learning strategy based on masking, Phone Masking Training (PMT), alleviates the impact of such phenomenon in Uyghur ASR. Although PMT achieves remarkably improvements, there still exists room for further gains due to the granularity mismatch between the masking unit of PMT (phoneme) and the modeling unit (word-piece). To boost the performance of PMT, we propose multi-modeling unit training (MMUT) architecture fusion with PMT (PM-MMUT). The idea of MMUT framework is to split the Encoder into two parts including acoustic feature sequences to phoneme-level representation (AF-to-PLR) and phoneme-level representation to word-piece-level representation (PLR-to-WPLR). It allows AF-to-PLR to be optimized by an intermediate phoneme-based CTC loss to learn the rich phoneme-level context information brought by PMT. Experimental results on Uyghur ASR show that the proposed approaches outperform obviously the pure PMT. We also conduct experiments on the 960-hour Librispeech benchmark using ESPnet1, which achieves about 10% relative WER reduction on all the test set without LM fusion comparing with the latest official ESPnet1 pre-trained model",

We empirically analyze the diversity between representations produced by the different attention heads and demonstrate that the heads become highly correlated during the course of training. We investigate a few approaches to increasing attention head diversity, including using different attention mechanisms for each head and auxiliary training loss functions to promote head diversity. We show that introducing diversity-promoting auxiliary loss functions during training is a more effective approach, and obtain WER improvements of up to 6% relative on the Librispeech corpus.

Since self-supervised learning requires large-scale unlabeled data, we need to effectively use data collected from a variety of domains. However, existing methods cannot construct valid representations in unknown domains because they cause overfitting to the domains in the training data. To solve this problem, our proposed method constructs contextual representations that cannot identify the domains from input speech by using domain adversarial neural networks. The domain adversarial training can improve robustness for data in unknown domains because the model trained by our proposed method can construct domain invariant representations. In addition, we investigate multi-task learning of representation construction and domain classification to consider domain information.

Therefore, we propose the following two attention weight smoothing methods based on the hypothesis that an attention weight matrix whose diagonal components are not peaky can capture more context information. One is a method to linearly interpolate the attention weight using a learnable truncated prior distribution. The other uses the attention weight from a previous layer as a prior distribution given that lower-layer weights tend to be less peaky and diagonal.

Leveraging the strong coherence between the user query utterance and their following contexts in the dialog, we present an effective intent induction approach with fine-tuning and clustering with contrastive learning. In particular, we first transform pretrained LMs into conversational encoders with in-domain dialogs. Then we conduct context-aware contrastive learning to reveal latent intent semantics via the coherence from dialog contexts. After obtaining the initial representations on both views of the query and their contexts, we propose a novel clustering method to iteratively refine the representation by minimizing semantic distances between pairs of utterances or contexts, under the same cluster assignment on the opposite view.

However, automatic speech recognition (ASR) errors are inevitable in real-world applications due to the environment noise, unique speech patterns and etc, leading to sharp performance drop in state-of-the-art text-based intent detection models. Essentially, this phenomenon is caused by the semantic drift brought by ASR errors and most existing works tend to focus on designing new model structures to reduce its impact, which is at the expense of versatility and flexibility. Different from previous one-piece model, in this paper, we propose a novel and agile framework called CR-ID for ASR error robust intent detection with two plug-and-play modules, namely semantic drift calibration module (SDCM) and phonemic refinement module (PRM), which are both model-agnostic and thus could be easily integrated to any existing intent detection models without mod-ifying their structures.

It may cause the topic mismatch between the overall dialogue and the selected knowledge, leading to the inconsistency of the generated response and the context. Therefore, in this study, we propose a Topic-driven Knowledge Selection method (TopicKS) to exploit topic information both in knowledge selection and knowledge-aware generation. Specifically, under the guidance of topic information, TopicKS selects more accurate candidate knowledge for the current turn of dialogue based on context information and historical knowledge information. Then the decoder uses the context information and selected knowledge to generate a higher-quality response under the guidance of topic information. Experiments on the notable benchmark corpus Wizard of Wikipedia (WoW) show that our proposed method not only achieves a significant improvement in terms of selection accuracy rate on knowledge selection, but also outperforms the baseline model in terms of the quality of the generated responses",

    "abstract": "Response tokens (also known as backchannels, continuers, or feedback) are a frequent feature of human interaction, where they serve to display understanding and streamline turn-taking. We propose a bottom-up method to study responsive behaviour across 16 languages (8 language families). We use sequential context and recurrence of turns formats to identify candidate response tokens in a language-agnostic way across diverse conversational corpora. We then use UMAP clustering directly on speech signals to represent structure and variation. We find that (i) written orthographic annotations underrepresent the attested variation, (ii) distinctions between formats can be gradient rather than discrete, (iii) most languages appear to make available a broad distinction between a minimal nasal format ‘mm' and a fuller ‘yeah'-like format. Charting this aspect of human interaction contributes to our understanding of interactional infrastructure across languages and can inform the design of speech technologies",

    "abstract": "End-to-end spoken language understanding (E2E-SLU) has witnessed impressive improvements through cross-modal (text-to-audio) transfer learning. However, current methods mostly focus on coarse-grained sequence-level text-to-audio knowledge transfer with simple loss, and neglecting the fine-grained temporal alignment between two modalities. In this work, we propose a novel multi-grained cross-modal transfer learning model for E2E-SLU. Specifically, we devise a cross attention module to align the tokens of text with the frame features of speech, encouraging the model to target at the salient acoustic features attended to each token during transferring the semantic information. We also leverage contrastive learning to facilitate cross-modal representation learning in sentence level. Finally, we explore various data augmentation methods to mitigate the deficiency of large amount of labelled data for the training of E2E-SLU.

Head-nodding, a kind of visual backchannels, is used to co-construct the conversation and is crucial to smooth social interaction. In the present study, we quantitively analyze how head-nodding relates to speech turn-taking and prosodic change in Japanese conversation. The results showed that nodding was less frequently observed in ASD participants, especially around speakers' turn transitions, whereas it was notable just before and after turn-taking in individuals with typical development (TD). Analysis using 16 sec of long-time sliding segments revealed that synchronization between nod frequency and mean vocal intensity was higher in the TD group than in the ASD group. Classification by a support vector machine (SVM) using these proposed features achieved high performance with an accuracy of 91.1% and an F-measure of 0.942. In addition, the results indicated an optimal way of nodding according to turn-ending and emphasis, which could provide standard responses for reference or feedback in social skill training for people with ASD. Furthermore, the natural timing of nodding implied by the results can also be applied to developing interactive responses in humanoid robots or computer graphic (CG) agents",

    "abstract": "When domain experts are needed to perform data annotation for complex machine-learning tasks, reducing annotation effort is crucial in order to cut down time and expenses. For cases when there are no annotations available, one approach is to utilize the structure of the feature space for clustering-based active learning (AL) methods. However, these methods are heavily dependent on how the samples are organized in the feature space and what distance metric is used. Unsupervised methods such as contrastive predictive coding (CPC) can potentially be used to learn organized feature spaces, but these methods typically create high-dimensional features which might be challenging for estimating data density. In this paper, we combine CPC and multiple dimensionality reduction methods in search of functioning practices for clustering-based AL. Our experiments for simulating speech emotion recognition system deployment show that both the local and global topology of the feature space can be successfully used for AL, and that CPC can be used to improve clustering-based AL performance over traditional signal features. Additionally, we observe that compressing data dimensionality does not harm AL performance substantially, and that 2-D feature representations achieved similar AL performance as higher-dimensional representations when the number of annotations is not very low",

In this paper, we investigate using multi-task learning, where attribute prediction is given as an auxiliary task to the model, and adversarial learning, where the model is explicitly trained to incorrectly predict attributes. We compare two adversarial learning approaches: gradient reversal and an adversarial discriminator. We evaluate these approaches in a cross-corpus training setting using two unseen corpora as test sets. We use four attributes -- corpus, speaker, gender and language -- and evaluate all possible combinations of these attributes.

It has an important role in making human-machine interaction natural. Conventional SER approaches emphasize more on magnitude spectrum for feature extraction and ignore phase information. Recent studies reveal that phase information has a significant part in analyzing speech acoustics. This work explores speech representation learning from magnitude and phase information using autoencoder for SER task. We trained the UNET autoencoder using Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs) and Modified Group Delay Function (MODGD) for learning representations. The encoder part of the trained UNET autoencoder is used as input to the neural network classifier and fine-tuned it concerning four emotions separately for MFCCs and MODGD. The learned representation for both MFCCs and MODGD are combined and given input to Support Vector Machine (SVM) for classification. The Deep Canonical Correlation Analysis (DCCA) is used to maximize the correlation between magnitude and phase information to improve the conventional SER system's performance.

Since it is easier to find unlabeled data, the use of self-supervised learning (SSL) has become an attractive alternative. This study proposes new pre-text tasks for SSL to improve SER. While our target application is SER, the proposed pre-text tasks includes audiovisual formulations, leveraging the relationship between acoustic and facial features. Our proposed approach introduces three new unimodal and multimodal pre-text tasks that are carefully designed to learn better representations for predicting emotional cues from speech. Task 1 predicts energy variations (high or low) from a speech sequence. Task 2 uses speech features to predict facial activation (high or low) based on facial landmark movements. Task 3 performs a multi-class emotion recognition task on emotional labels obtained from combinations of action units (AUs) detected across a video sequence. We pre-train a network with 60.92 hours of unlabeled data, fine-tuning the model for the downstream SER task. The results on the CREMA-D dataset show that the model pre-trained on the proposed domain-specific pre-text tasks significantly improves the precision (up to 5.1%), recall (up to 4.5%), and F1-scores (up to 4.9%) of our SER system",

In this study, we propose \"signal-to-noise ratio improvement (SNRi) target training\"; the SE frontend is trained to output a signal whose SNRi is controlled by an auxiliary scalar input. In joint training with a backend, the target SNRi value is estimated by an auxiliary network. By training all networks to minimize the backend task loss, we can estimate the appropriate noise reduction level for each noisy input in a data-driven scheme. Our experiments showed that the SNRi target training enables control of the output SNRi. In addition, the proposed joint training relatively reduces word error rate by 4.0\\% and 5.7\\% compared to a Conformer-based standard ASR model and conventional SE-ASR joint training model, respectively.

To address the mismatch issue, numerous noise adaptation strategies have been derived. In this paper, we propose a novel method, called noise adaptive speech enhancement with target-conditional resampling (NASTAR), which reduces mismatches with only one sample (one-shot) of noisy speech in the target environment. NASTAR uses a feedback mechanism to simulate adaptive training data via a noise extractor and a retrieval model. The noise extractor estimates the target noise from the noisy speech, called pseudo-noise. The noise retrieval model retrieves relevant noise samples from a pool of noise signals according to the noisy speech, called relevant-cohort. The pseudo-noise and the relevant-cohort set are jointly sampled and mixed with the source speech corpus to prepare simulated training data for noise adaptation. Experimental results show that NASTAR can effectively use one noisy speech sample to adapt an SE model to a target condition. Moreover, both the noise extractor and the noise retrieval model contribute to model adaptation. To our best knowledge, NASTAR is the first work to perform one-shot noise adaptation through noise extraction and retrieval",

In this paper, we conduct a systematic comparison between different methods of incorporating phonetic information in a speech enhancement model. By conducting a series of controlled experiments, we observe the influence of different phonetic content models as well as various feature-injection techniques on enhancement performance, considering both causal and non-causal models. Specifically, we evaluate three settings for injecting phonetic information, namely: i) feature conditioning; ii) perceptual supervision; and iii) regularization. Phonetic features are obtained using an intermediate layer of either a supervised pre-trained Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) model or by using a pre-trained Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) model.

Speech separation on the other hand is the challenging task of separating individual speakers from an overlapping mixed signal of various speakers. Speaker attractors are high-dimensional embedding vectors that pull the time-frequency bins of each speaker's speech towards themselves while repelling those belonging to other speakers. In this work, we explore the possibility of using these powerful speaker attractors for zero-shot speaker adaptation in multi-speaker TTS synthesis and propose speaker attractor text to speech (SATTS).

Furthermore, our aim is to generate the corrected production while maintaining the speaker's original voice. The system prompts the user to pronounce a phrase. The speech is recorded, and the samples associated with the inaccurate phoneme are masked with zeros.

    "abstract": "Speech synthesis for poetry is challenging due to specific intonation patterns inherent to poetic speech. In this work, we propose an approach to synthesise poems with almost human like naturalness in order to enable literary scholars to systematically examine hypotheses on the interplay between text, spoken realisation, and the listener's perception of poems. To meet these special requirements for literary studies, we resynthesise poems by cloning prosodic values from a human reference recitation, and afterwards make use of fine-grained prosody control to manipulate the synthetic speech in a human-in-the-loop setting to alter the recitation w.r.t. specific phenomena. We find that finetuning our TTS model on poetry captures poetic intonation patterns to a large extent which is beneficial for prosody cloning and manipulation and verify the success of our approach both in an objective evaluation as well as in human studies",

In this work, the German Kiel corpus was augmented with synthetic data generated with the state-of-the-art articulatory synthesizer VocalTractLab. It is shown that the additional synthetic data can lead to a significantly better performance in single-phoneme recognition in certain cases, while at the same time, the performance can also decrease in other cases, depending on the degree of acoustic naturalness of the synthetic phonemes.

Although these approaches are increasingly popular, they require large amounts of data and computational resources. There is still a substantial need for benchmarking methodologies ever upwards on under-resourced languages in data-scarce application conditions. Most pre-trained language models were massively studied using the English language and only a few of them were evaluated on French. In this paper, we propose a unified benchmark, focused on evaluating models quality and their ecological impact on two well-known French spoken language understanding tasks. Especially we benchmark thirteen well-established Transformer-based models on the two available spoken language understanding tasks for French: MEDIA and ATIS-FR. Within this framework, we show that compact models can reach comparable results to bigger ones while their ecological impact is considerably lower.

SLU systems usually consist of (1) an automatic speech recognition (ASR) module (2) an interface module that exposes relevant outputs from ASR, and (3) a natural language understanding (NLU) module. Interfaces in SLU systems carry information on text transcriptions or richer information like neural embeddings from ASR to NLU. In this paper, we study how interfaces affect joint-training for spoken language understanding. Most notably, we obtain the state-of-the-art results on the publicly available 50-hr SLURP [1] dataset. We first leverage large-size pretrained ASR and NLU models that are connected by a text interface, and then jointly train both models via a sequence loss function. For scenarios where pretrained models are not utilized, the best results are obtained through a joint sequence loss training using richer neural interfaces.

    "abstract": "We address the problem of detecting speech directed to a device that does not contain a specific wake-word. Specifically, we focus on audio coming from a touch-based invocation. Mitigating virtual assistants (VAs) activation due to accidental button presses is critical for user experience. While the majority of approaches to false trigger mitigation (FTM) are designed to detect the presence of a target keyword, inferring user intent in absence of keyword is difficult. This also poses a challenge when creating the training/evaluation data for such systems due to inherent ambiguity in the user's data. To this end, we propose a novel FTM approach that uses weakly-labeled training data obtained with a newly introduced data sampling strategy. While this sampling strategy reduces data annotation efforts, the data labels are noisy as the data are not annotated manually. We use these data to train an acoustics-only model for the FTM task by regularizing its loss function via knowledge distillation from an ASR-based (LatticeRNN) model. This improves the model decisions, resulting in 66% gain in accuracy, as measured by equal-error-rate (EER), over the base acoustics-only model. We also show that the ensemble of the LatticeRNN and acoustic-distilled models brings further accuracy improvement of 20%",

We compare cohort discovery based on geographic and demographic information to a more scalable method that groups speakers without human labels, using speaker embedding technology.

Nonetheless, prior work on ASR finds performance gaps conditioned by specific gender and racial groups, revealing systematic biases in modern ASR systems. However, work has focused on native varieties of English, glossing over its impact on a wider range of ASR users, namely second language speakers of English. The present work compares the performance of the transcription system Otter, on 24 varieties of English, 21 of them are non-native varieties. We compare the word and phone error rate (WER/PER) of accent varieties that are claimed to be supported by Otter and those that are unsupported. Results show that English varieties that are supported have lower WERs compared to that of unsupported varieties. However, there are still systematic differences in performance conditioned by linguistic structure in both supported and unsupported Englishes. Specifically, Otter performs better on English varieties from non-tonal first language speakers. We conclude that while inclusion of more varieties of English in the training data set for ASR may promote inclusivity, there may still be biases inherent to the linguistic structure that should not be overlooked",

These models are pre-trained on unlabeled audio data and then used in speech processing downstream tasks such as automatic speech recognition (ASR) or speech translation (ST). Since these models are now used in research and industrial systems alike, it becomes necessary to understand the impact caused by some features such as gender distribution within pre-training data. Using French as our investigation language, we train and compare gender-specific wav2vec 2.0 models against models containing different degrees of gender balance in their pre-training data. The comparison is performed by applying these models to two speech-to-text downstream tasks: ASR and ST. Results show the type of downstream integration matters. We observe lower overall performance using gender-specific pre-training before fine-tuning an end-to-end ASR system. However, when self-supervised models are used as feature extractors, the overall ASR and ST results follow more complex patterns in which the balanced pre-trained model does not necessarily lead to the best results. Lastly, our crude 'fairness' metric, the relative performance difference measured between female and male test sets, does not display a strong variation from balanced to gender-specific pre-trained wav2vec 2.0 models",

To address issues of limited labeled data, we use a weakly supervised model to compress prosodic and X-vector features into more task-relevant representations. An XGBoost model is then used to predict the speaker's dialect density from these features and show which are most significant during inference. We evaluate the utility of these features both alone and in combination for the given task. This work, which does not rely on hand-labeled transcripts, is performed on audio segments from the CORAAL database.

A popular approach is to fine-tune the model with data from regions where the ASR model has a higher word error rate (WER). However, when the ASR model is adapted to get better performance on these high-WER regions, its parameters wander from the previous optimal values, which can lead to worse performance in other regions. In our proposed method, we utilize the elastic weight consolidation (EWC) regularization loss to identify directions in parameters space along which the ASR weights can vary to improve for high-error regions, while still maintaining performance on the speaker population overall. Our results demonstrate that EWC can reduce the word error rate (WER) in the region with highest WER by 3.2% relative while reducing the overall WER by 1.3% relative.

By integrating the two methods, this study aims at tracking gradual improvements of learners' skill during shadowing practices. We held a special program of 42-day Shadowing Marathon, where Japanese learners of English participated in shadowing practices every day for six weeks. Four new oral passages were presented daily, each of which was shadowed repeatedly. From the obtained data, we analyzed gradual improvements in learners' perception and production of both segments and prosody through repeating shadowing within a day, and through continuing the shadowing practices over 42 days. The results of analysis showed that, while learners' perception of segments and prosody improved significantly even with no explicit instructions, their production did not show significant improvement in a self-learning condition. The data also showed in what way learners depend on written input and auditory input when they learn perception and production of L2 sounds",

On the other hand, spoofing methods that have been shown to present problems to automatic systems in past work do not present problems to the forensic phonetician. The main contribution of this paper is a descriptive account of different spoofed speech samples, based on the auditory-acoustic evaluation of a forensic phonetician. This is to spark an awareness of the current possibilities of spoofing methods that perhaps have so far been ‘off the radar' for many forensic phoneticians.

The purpose of this study is to investigate how much f0 lowering is perceived as equally prominent to understand a perceptually acceptable pitch range of Japanese downstep. A prominence perception test was conducted with varying peak f0s of two successive phrases. Results of the test reveal that there is a particular f0 level of the following phrase to be perceived as equally prominent as the preceding phrase, regardless of the peak f0 of the preceding phrase. This result indicates that f0 differences between the preceding and the following phrases are greater as the f0 of the preceding phrase increases, corroborating the effect of f0 on prominence perception found in the literature.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "We propose a new method to estimate the glottal vocal tract excitation from speech signals based on deep learning. To that end, a bidirectional recurrent neural network with long short-term memory units was trained to predict the glottal airflow derivative from the speech signal. Since natural reference data for this task is unobtainable at the required scale, we used the articulatory speech synthesizer VocalTractLab to generate a large dataset containing synchronous connected speech and glottal airflow signals for training. The trained model's performance was objectively evaluated by means of stationary synthetic signals from the OPENGLOT glottal inverse filtering benchmark dataset and by using our dataset of connected synthetic speech. Compared to the state of the art, the proposed model produced a more accurate estimation using OPENGLOT's physically synthesized signals but was less accurate for its computationally simulated signals. However, our model was much more accurate and plausible on the connected speech signals, especially for sounds with mixed excitation (e.g. fricatives) or sounds with pronounced zeros in their transfer function (e.g. nasals). Future work will introduce more variety into the training data (e.g. regarding pitch and phonation) and focus on estimating features of the glottal flow instead of the entire waveform",

    "abstract": "Laughter is one of the most encountered paralinguistic phenomena in conversation. Similarly to other communicative elements, evidence for laughter convergence, in particular for its temporal distribution and its acoustic marking, has been found between interlocutors. We investigate here whether segmental-level convergence effects, previously observed for speech, may be also found in the case of laughter. Using a corpus of dyadic interactions, we evaluate phonetic convergence of the vocalic part of laughs, by means of distances between the formant values. This was carried out for two proposed measures of convergence: global – at the level of the entire conversation, and local – considering consecutive laughs. Our global measure results reveal that interlocutors converge towards the end of the interaction, compared to its beginning, although important individual variation exists. With respect to the local measure, our findings show a lack of phonetic convergence (or divergence) between conversational partners",

In the present study, 20 speakers aged 25-35 were recorded while orally telling 5 successive self-defining autobiographic memories (SDM). By definition, this task is highly emotional, although emotional load and emotion regulation are expected to vary across SDM. Seven acoustic parameters were extracted: MeanF0, MedianFo, StandardDeviationF0, MinF0, MaxF0, Duration and SpeechRate. All SDM were manually transcribed, then their emotional lexicon was analysed using Emotaix. First, speech productions were examined in reference with SDM characteristics (specificity, integrative meaning and affective valence) as determined by 3 independent investigators. Results showed that overall the speech parameters did not change over the time course of the experiment, or as a function of integrative meaning. Specific memories were recounted at a higher speech rate and at greater length than non specific ones. SDM with positive affective valence were shorter and included less variability in fundamental frequency than negative SDM. Second, emotionally-charged (positive vs. negative; high vs. low arousal) vs. emotionally-neutral utterances as to Emotaix classification were compared over all SDM. Only a few significant effects were observed, which led us to discuss the role of emotion regulation in the SDM task",

    "abstract": "Romance languages such as Italian or Spanish preserve fricative voicing contrasts in word-final position, while their neutralization has been reported for European Portuguese, but the behavior of Romanian fricatives remains understudied. Previous work with Romanian fricatives suggests a pattern of final devoicing but, due to the specific properties of the corpus analyzed, it is unclear if this is limited to the presence of secondary palatalization and/or the result of morphological conditioning. In this study, we apply speech processing tools to investigate the acoustic characteristics of the voicing contrast in fricatives in contemporary spoken Romanian. We examine a corpus of prepared speech from newscasts and semi-spontaneous TV debates (86 speakers) and compare our results to previous findings from a corpus of controlled experimental speech (31 speakers). Our classification tool employs cepstral coefficients and hidden Markov model (HMM)-defined temporal regions to identify the properties of these segments. Our findings conform to typological predictions regarding partial devoicing in coda position, especially at more posterior places, but we find little support for voicing neutralization in Romanian fricatives more generally. Our study thus documents the properties of Romanian fricatives and contributes to our understanding of the dynamics of contrast maintenance in phonological systems",

    "abstract": "In the Chengdu dialect of Mandarin, the /(V)an/ rime words have been described to have undergone a nasal loss process in the last decades. However, no acoustical or physiological evidence has been provided so far. In this study, we investigate this sound change process by directly looking at the velum gesture in the target words from 4 Chengdu speakers. By means of real-time Magnetic Resonance Imaging (rt-MRI), the velum opening signal was captured along with synchronized and noise suppressed audio. The maximum degree of velum opening was compared between tautosyllabic and heterosyllabic VN sequences for different vowels (N = /n, ŋ/). Nasal consonant loss was most evident for tautosyllabic /(V)an/ rime words. This sound change, together with the observed diachronic vowel raising in /(V)an/ rimes, is compatible with other research showing a preference for low vowel raising before nasal consonants. This phonetically motivated oral vowel, which is a consequence of nasal coda loss and vowel raising, would form a new phonological contrast in this dialect e.g., from /pa, pan/ to /pa, pɛ/",

    "abstract": "Language sample analysis (LSA) is a powerful tool for both therapeutic applications and research of child speech and language development. Nevertheless, it is not routinely used, due to the high cost of manual transcription and analysis. Assistance by automatic speech recognition for children has the potential to enable a wide-spread use of LSA. However, the development of modern speech recognition systems heavily relies on large scale datasets. Therefore, it faces the same obstacle of high cost for transcription as LSA itself. In this paper, we study how cheaply transcribed child speech, i. e., limited to an orthographic transcription, can be improved on a phonetic level by leveraging a CTC based automatic speech recognition model, trained on a small phonetically transcribed dataset. We constrain the CTC decoding by modeling variation of the pronunciation given the orthographic transcription using weighted finite state automata. Our experiments show that the transcription is improved in terms of phone error rate by relative 14% when applying our method. Additionally, we show how the improved transcript can in turn be leveraged to improve the training of a new model",

In multi-lingual events such as international meetings and court proceedings, simultaneous interpretation by a human is often available for speeches of low-resource languages. In this setting, we can assume that the content of its back-translation is the same as the transcription of the original speech. Thus, the former is expected to enhance the later process. We formulate this framework as a joint process of ASR and machine translation (MT) and implement it with a combination of cross attention mechanisms of the ASR encoder and the MT encoder. We evaluate the proposed method using the spoken language translation corpus of the Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia (ECCC), achieving a significant improvement in the ASR word error rate (WER) of Khmer by 8.9% relative.

However, it is not known whether ASR errors pattern according to accent differences. Therefore, we tested the performance of Google's General American (GenAm) and Standard Australian English (SAusE) ASR on both dialects using words systematically representing accent differences. Accent differences were quantified using the different number of vowel phonemes, the different phonetic quality of vowels, and differences in rhoticity (i.e., presence/absence of postvocalic /r/). Our results confirm that word recognition is significantly more accurate when ASR dialect matches the speaker dialect compared to the mismatched conditions. Our results reveal that GenAm ASR is less accurate on SAusE speakers due to the higher number of vowel phonemes and to the lack of post-vocalic /r/ in SAusE. Thus, the data need of adapting ASR from GenAm to SAusE might be reduced by using a small dataset focusing on differences in the size of vowel inventory and in rhoticity",

    "abstract": "For a better understanding of the mechanisms underlying speech perception and the contribution of different signal features, computational models of speech recognition have a long tradition in hearing research. Due to the diverse range of situations in which speech needs to be recognized, these models need to be generalizable across many acoustic conditions, speakers, and languages. This contribution examines the importance of different features for speech recognition predictions of plain and Lombard speech for English in comparison to Cantonese in stationary and modulated noise. While Cantonese is a tonal language that encodes information in spectro-temporal features, the Lombard effect is known to be associated with spectral changes in the speech signal. These contrasting properties of tonal languages and the Lombard effect form an interesting basis for the assessment of speech recognition models. Here, an automatic speech recognition-based (ASR) model using spectral or spectro-temporal features is evaluated with empirical data. The results indicate that spectro-temporal features are crucial in order to predict the speaker-specific speech recognition threshold SRT50 in both Cantonese and English as well as to account for the improvement of speech recognition in modulated noise, while effects due to Lombard speech can already be predicted by spectral features",

However, simply removing all personally identifiable information (PII) from end-to-end model training data leads to a significant performance degradation in particular for the recognition of names, dates, locations, and words from similar categories. We propose and evaluate a two-step method for partially recovering this loss. First, PII is identified, and each occurrence is replaced with a random word sequence of the same category. Then, corresponding audio is produced via text-to-speech or by splicing together matching audio fragments extracted from the corpus. These artificial audio/label pairs, together with speaker turns from the original data without PII, are used to train models. We evaluate the performance of this method on in-house data of medical conversations and observe a recovery of almost the entire performance degradation in the general word error rate while still maintaining a strong diarization performance. Our main focus is the improvement of recall and precision in the recognition of PII-related words. Depending on the PII category, between 50% - 90% of the performance degradation can be recovered using our proposed method",

Therefore, the current practice is to use dialect-specific ASRs. However, dialect-specific information or data is hard to obtain making it difficult to build dialect-specific ASRs. Furthermore, it is cumbersome to maintain multiple dialect-specific ASR systems for each language. We build a unified multi-dialect End-to-End ASR that removes the need for a dialect recognition block and the need to maintain multiple dialect-specific ASRs for three Telugu regional dialects: Telangana, Coastal Andhra, and Rayalaseema. We find that pooling the data and training a multi-dialect ASR benefits the low-resource dialect the most -- an improvement of over 9.71% in relative Word Error Rate (WER). Subsequently, we experiment with multi-task ASRs where the primary task is to transcribe the audio and the secondary task is to predict the dialect. We do this by adding a Dialect ID to the output targets. Such a model outperforms naive multi-dialect ASRs by up to 8.24% in relative WER. Additionally, we test this model on a dialect recognition task and find that it outperforms strong baselines by 6.14% in accuracy",

The statistical analysis of learned kernel offsets provides an insight into the change of information in features with the network depth.

Language information, however, is very salient in the bilingual model only, suggesting CPC models learn to discriminate languages when trained on multiple languages. Some language information can also be retrieved from monolingual models, but it is more diffused across all features. These patterns hold when analyses are carried on the discrete units from a downstream clustering model.

However, there is often a relationship between the corresponding topics of consecutive tokens. In this paper, we present an extension to LDA that uses a Markov chain to model temporal information. We use this new model for acoustic unit discovery from speech. As input tokens, the model takes a discretised encoding of speech from a vector quantised (VQ) neural network with 512 codes. The goal is then to map these 512 VQ codes to 50 phone-like units (topics) in order to more closely resemble true phones. In contrast to the base LDA, which only considers how VQ codes co-occur within utterances (documents), the Markov chain LDA additionally captures how consecutive codes follow one another. This extension leads to an increase in cluster quality and phone segmentation results compared to the base LDA. Compared to a recent vector quantised neural network approach that also learns 50 units, the extended LDA model performs better in phone segmentation but worse in mutual information",

    "abstract": "Speaker embedding has been a fundamental feature for speaker-related tasks such as verification, clustering, and diarization. Traditionally, speaker embeddings are represented as fixed vectors in high-dimensional space. This could lead to biased estimations, especially when handling shorter utterances. In this paper we propose to represent a speaker utterance as \"floating\" vector whose state is indeterminate without knowing the context. The state of a speaker representation is jointly determined by itself, other speech from the same speaker, as well as other speakers it is being compared to. The content of the speech also contributes to determining the final state of a speaker representation. We pre-train an indeterminate speaker representation model that estimates the state of an utterance based on the context. The pre-trained model can be fine-tuned for downstream tasks such as speaker verification, speaker clustering, and speaker diarization. Substantial improvements are observed across all downstream tasks",

    "abstract": "Automatic speaker verification has achieved remarkable progress in recent years. However, there is little research on cross-age speaker verification due to insufficient data. In this paper, we mine cross-age test sets based on the VoxCeleb and propose our age-invariant speaker representation learning method. Since the VoxCeleb is collected from the YouTube platform, the dataset consists of cross-age data inherently. However, the meta-data does not contain the speaker age label. Therefore, we adopt the face age estimation method to predict the speaker age value from the associated visual data, then label the audio recording with the estimated age. We construct multiple Cross-Age test sets on VoxCeleb (Vox-CA), which deliberately select the positive trials with large age-gap. Also, the effect of nationality and gender is considered in selecting negative pairs to align with Vox-H cases. The baseline system performance drops from 1.939% EER on the Vox-H test set to 10.419\\% on the Vox-CA20 test set, which indicates how difficult the cross-age scenario is. Consequently, we propose an age-decoupling adversarial learning (ADAL) method to alleviate the negative effect of the age gap and reduce intra-class variance. Our method outperforms the baseline system by over 10% related EER reduction on the Vox-CA20 test set",

    "abstract": "In speaker recognition, where speech segments are mapped to embeddings on the unit hypersphere, two scoring backends are commonly used, namely cosine scoring or PLDA. Both have advantages and disadvantages, depending on the context. Cosine scoring follows naturally from the spherical geometry, but for PLDA the blessing is mixed—length normalization Gaussianizes the between-speaker distribution, but violates the assumption of a speaker-independent within-speaker distribution. We propose PSDA, an analogue to PLDA that uses Von Mises- Fisher distributions on the hypersphere for both within and between-class distributions. We show how the self-conjugacy of this distribution gives closed-form likelihood-ratio scores, making it a drop-in replacement for PLDA at scoring time. All kinds of trials can be scored, including single-enroll and multienroll verification, as well as more complex likelihood-ratios that could be used in clustering and diarization. Learning is done via an EM-algorithm with closed-form updates. We explain the model and present some first experiments",

    "abstract": "For online speaker diarization, samples arrive incremen tally, and the overall distribution of the samples is invisible. Moreover, in most existing clustering-based methods, the train ing objective of the embedding extractor is not designed spe cially for clustering. To improve online speaker diarization per formance, we propose a unified online clustering framework, which provides an interactive manner between embedding ex tractors and clustering algorithms. Specifically, the framework consists of two highly coupled parts: clustering-guided recur rent training (CGRT) and paths truncated beam search (PTBS). The CGRT introduces the clustering algorithm into the training process of embedding extractors, which could provide not only cluster-aware information for the embedding extractor, but also crucial parameters for the clustering process afterward. And with these parameters, which contain preliminary information of the metric space, the PTBS penalizes the probability score of each cluster, in order to output more accurate clustering re sults in online fashion with low latency. With the above innova tions, our proposed online clustering system achieves 14.48% DER with collar 0.25 at 2.5s latency on the AISHELL-4, while the DER of the offline agglomerative hierarchical clustering is 14.57%",

And a set of binary classification output layers produces activities of each speaker. With the finely designed end-to-end structure, the proposed method can explicitly handle the overlapping speech and distinguish between speech and non-speech accurately with multi-modal information. I-vectors are the key point to solve the alignment problem caused by visual modality error (e.g., occlusions, off-screen speakers or unreliable detection). Besides, our audio-visual model is robust to the absence of visual modality, where the diarization performance degrades significantly using the visual-only model. Evaluated on the datasets of the first multi-model information based speech processing (MISP) challenge, the proposed method achieved diarization error rates (DERs) of 10.1%/9.5% on development/eval set with reference voice activity detection (VAD) information, while audio-only and video-only system yielded DERs of 27.9%/29.0% and 14.6%/13.1% respectively",

To further improve the performance of the end-to-end speaker diarization for real speech recordings, recently works have been proposed which integrate unsupervised clustering algorithms with the end-to-end neural diarization models. However, these methods have a number of drawbacks: 1) The unsupervised clustering algorithms cannot leverage the supervision from the available datasets; 2) The K-means-based unsupervised algorithms that are explored often suffer from the constraint violation problem; 3) There is unavoidable mismatch between the supervised training and the unsupervised inference. In this paper, a robust generic neural clustering approach is proposed that can be integrated with any chunk-level predictor to accomplish a fully supervised end-to-end speaker diarization model. Also, by leveraging the sequence modelling ability of a recurrent neural network, the proposed neural clustering approach can dynamically estimate the number of speakers during inference. Experimental show that when integrating an attractor-based chunk-level predictor, the proposed neural clustering approach can yield better Diarization Error Rate (DER) than the constrained K-means-based clustering approaches under the mismatched conditions",

    "abstract": "Recent speaker diarization studies showed that integration of end-to-end neural diarization (EEND) and clustering-based diarization is a promising approach for achieving state-of-the-art performance on various tasks. Such an approach first divides an observed signal into fixed-length segments, then performs segment-level local diarization based on an EEND module, and merges the segment-level results via clustering to form a final global diarization result. The segmentation is done to limit the number of speakers in each segment since the current EEND cannot handle many of speakers. In this paper, we argue that such an approach involving the segmentation has several issues; for example, it inevitably faces a dilemma that larger segment sizes increase both the context available for enhancing the performance and the number of speakers for the EEND module to handle. To resolve such a problem, this paper proposes a novel framework that performs diarization without segmentation. However, it can still handle challenging data containing many speakers and a significant amount of overlapping speech.

More specifically, we use the detection result of a target sound detection (TSD) network as the additional information to guide the learning of target sound extraction network. We also find that the result of TSE can further improve the performance of the TSD network, so that a mutual learning framework of the target sound detection and extraction is proposed. In addition, a target-weighted time-frequency loss function is designed to pay more attention to the temporal regions of the target sound during training. Experimental results on the synthesized data generated from the Freesound Datasets show that our proposed method can significantly improve the performance of TSE",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Sound event detection (SED) is an interesting but challenging task due to the scarcity of data and diverse sound events in real life. This paper presents a multi-grained based attention network (MGA-Net) for semi-supervised sound event detection. To obtain the feature representations related to sound events, a residual hybrid convolution (RH-Conv) block is designed to boost the vanilla convolution's ability to extract the time-frequency features. Moreover, a multi-grained attention (MGA) module is designed to learn temporal resolution features from coarse-level to fine-level. With the MGA module, the network could capture the characteristics of target events with short- or long-duration, resulting in more accurately determining the onset and offset of sound events. Furthermore, to effectively boost the performance of the Mean Teacher (MT) method, a spatial shift (SS) module as a data perturbation mechanism is introduced to increase the diversity of data. Experimental results show that the MGA-Net outperforms the published state-of-the-art competitors, achieving 53.27% and 56.96% event-based macro F1 (EB-F1) score, 0.709 and 0.739 polyphonic sound detection score (PSDS) on the validation and public set respectively",

    "title": "Temporal coding with magnitude-phase regularization for sound event detection",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Sound Event Detection (SED) is the challenge of identifying sound events into their temporal boundaries as well as sound category. With recent advances in deep learning, more effective SED techniques are investigated through the annual challenge of Detection and Classification of Acoustic Scenes and Events (DCASE). Most SED systems rely on data-driven learning where a deep neural network is trained to minimize the error between model prediction and the truth. While this framework is generally effective at identifying sound classes present in an audio recording, it results in unreliable estimates of temporal information for identifying sound boundaries. In order to heighten the temporal precision, this paper proposes a novel temporal coding of magnitude and phase for embedding vectors in an intermediate layer. This coding is reflected as a regularization term in the objective function for training the model. The regularization allows magnitude of embedding vectors to increase near event boundaries, which represent the onset and offset points. Simultaneously, each of the boundaries are distinguishable from others using phase difference between two neighboring vectors. This approach results in notable improvement in timing sensitivity compared to a baseline system tested on SED task in the context of DCASE2021 challenge",

    "abstract": "Recently, the Transformer-based model has been applied to sound event detection and audio classification tasks. However, when processing the audio spectrogram on a fine-grained scale, the computational cost is still high even with a hierarchical structure. In this paper, we introduce APT: an audio pyramid transformer with quadtree attention to reduce the computational complexity from quadratic to linear. Besides, most previous methods for weakly supervised sound event detection (WSSED) utilize the multi-instance learning (MIL) mechanism. However, MIL focuses more on the accuracy of bags (clips) rather than the instances (frames), so it tends to localize the most distinct part but not the whole sound event. To solve this problem, we provide a novel perspective that models WSSED as a domain adaption (DA) task, where the weights of the classifier trained on the source (clip) domain are shared to the target (frame) domain to enhance localization performance. Furthermore, we introduce a DAD (domain adaption detection) loss to align the feature distribution between frame and clip domain and make the classifier perceive frame domain information better. Experiments show that our APT achieves new state-of-the-art (SOTA) results on AudioSet, DCASE2017 and Urban-SED datasets. Moreover, our DA-WSSED pipeline significantly outperforms the MIL-based WSSED method",

Most research studies simulate this process by sampling support examples randomly and uniformly from all test data with the target class label. However, in many real-world scenarios, users might not even have five examples at hand or these examples may be from a limited context and not representative, resulting in model performance lower than expected. In this work, we relax these assumptions, and to recover model performance, we propose to use active learning techniques to efficiently sample additional informative support examples at inference time. We developed a novel dataset simulating the long-term temporal characteristics of sound events in real-world environmental soundscapes. Then we ran a series of experiments with this dataset to explore the modeling and sampling choices that arise when combining few-shot learning and active learning, including different training schemes, sampling strategies, models, and temporal windows in sampling",

    "abstract": "Models based on diverse attention mechanisms have recently shined in tasks related to acoustic event classification (AEC). Among them, self-attention is often used in audio-only tasks to help the model recognize different acoustic events. Self-attention relies on the similarity between time frames, and uses global information from the whole segment to highlight specific features within a frame. In real life, information related to acoustic events will attenuate over time, which means the information within some frames around the event deserves more attention than distant time global information that may be unrelated to the event. This paper shows that self-attention may over-enhance certain segments of audio representations, and smooth out the boundaries between events representations and background noises. Hence, this paper proposes an event-related data conditioning (EDC) for AEC. EDC directly works on spectrograms. The idea of EDC is to adaptively select the frame-related attention range based on acoustic features, and gather the event-related local information to represent the frame. Experiments show that: 1) compared with spectrogram-based data augmentation methods and trainable feature weighting and self-attention, EDC outperforms them in both the original-size mode and the augmented mode; 2) EDC effectively gathers event-related local information and enhances boundaries between events and backgrounds, improving the performance of AEC",

To maximize the benefits of GAN, it is crucial to find a powerful discriminator that can capture rich distinguishable information. In this paper, we propose a multi-scale time-frequency spectrogram discriminator to help NAR-TTS generate high-fidelity Mel-spectrograms. It treats the spectrogram as a 2D image to exploit the correlation among different components in the time-frequency domain. And a U-Net-based model structure is employed to discriminate at different scales to capture both coarse-grained and fine-grained information. We conduct subjective tests to evaluate the proposed approach. Both multi-scale and time-frequency discriminating bring significant improvement in the naturalness and fidelity. When combining the neural vocoder, it is shown more effective and concise than fine-tuning the vocoder. Finally, we visualize the discriminating maps to compare their difference to verify the effectiveness of multi-scale discriminating",

Due to the rich representation of global factors, we manage to achieve high speaker similarity in a zero-shot manner. In addition, we introduce a prosody smoothing task to make the local prosody factor context-aware and therefore achieve satisfactory prosody continuity. We further achieve high voice quality with an adversarial training stage. In the subjective test, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in both naturalness and similarity.

Though NanoFlow, which has a small number of parameters, is a state-of-the-art autoregressive neural vocoder, the performance of NanoFlow is marginally lower than WaveFlow. Therefore, we propose a new type of autoregressive neural vocoder called FlowVocoder, which has a small memory footprint and is capable of generating high-fidelity audio in real-time. Our proposed model improves the density estimation of flow blocks by utilizing a mixture of Cumulative Distribution Functions (CDF) for bipartite transformation. Hence, the proposed model is capable of modeling waveform signals, while its memory footprint is much smaller than WaveFlow.

Current TTS systems usually leverage a cascaded acoustic model and vocoder pipeline with mel-spectrograms as the intermediate representations, which suffer from two limitations: first, the acoustic model and vocoder are separately trained instead of jointly optimized, which incurs cascaded errors; second, the intermediate speech representations (e.g., mel-spectrogram) are predesigned and lose phase information, which are sub-optimal. To solve these problems, in this paper, we develop DelightfulTTS 2, a new end-to-end speech synthesis system with automatically learned speech representations and jointly optimized acoustic model and vocoder. Specifically, 1) We propose a new codec network based on vector-quantized auto-encoders with adversarial training (VQ-GAN) to extract intermediate frame-level speech representations (instead of traditional representations like mel-spectrograms) and reconstruct speech waveform. 2) We jointly optimize the acoustic model (based on DelightfulTTS) and the vocoder (the decoder of VQ-GAN), with an auxiliary loss on the acoustic model to predict intermediate speech representations.

The solution to constructing a custom voice is to combine an adaptive acoustic model with a robust vocoder. However, training a robust vocoder usually requires a multi-speaker dataset, which should include various age groups and various timbres, so that the trained vocoder can be used for unseen speakers. Collecting such a multi-speaker dataset is difficult, and the dataset distribution always has a mismatch with the distribution of the target speaker dataset. This paper proposes an adaptive vocoder for custom voice from another novel perspective to solve the above problems. The adaptive vocoder mainly uses a cross-domain consistency loss to solve the overfitting problem encountered by the GAN-based neural vocoder in the transfer learning of few-shot scenes. We construct two adaptive vocoders, AdaMelGAN and AdaHiFi-GAN. First, We pre-train the source vocoder model on AISHELL3 and CSMSC datasets, respectively.

To address this problem, we propose RefineGAN, a high-fidelity neural vocoder focused on the robustness, pitch and intensity accuracy, and high-speed full-band audio generation. We applyed a pitch-guided refine architecture with a multi-scale spectrogram-based loss function to help stabilize the training process and maintain the robustness of the neural vocoder while using the GAN-based training method. Audio generated using this method shows a better performance in subjective tests when compared with the ground-truth audio. This result shows that the fidelity is even improved during the waveform reconstruction by eliminating defects produced by recording procedures.

Although high-fidelity audio can be generated by recent neural vocoders from ground-truth(GT) mel-spectrogram, the gap between the GT and the predicted mel-spectrogram from AM degrades the performance of the entire TTS system. In this work, we propose VQTTS, consisting of an AM txt2vec and a vocoder vec2wav, which uses self-supervised vector-quantized(VQ) acoustic feature rather than mel-spectrogram. We redesign both the AM and the vocoder accordingly. In particular, txt2vec basically becomes a classification model instead of a traditional regression model while vec2wav uses an additional feature encoder before HifiGAN generator for smoothing the discontinuous quantized feature.

SiDWaveFlow can generate high-quality speech in real-time with the constraint of limited training data. Specifically, in SiDWaveFlow, a module named Semi-inverse Dynamic Transformation (SiDT) is proposed to improve the synthesis quality as well as the computational efficiency by replacing the affine coupling layers (ACL) used in WaveGlow. In addition, a preemphasis operation is introduced to the training process of SiD-WaveFlow to further improve the quality of the synthesized speech. Experimental results have corroborated that SiDWaveFlow can generate speech with better quality compared with its counterparts. Particularly, the TTS system integrating SiD-WaveFlow vocoder achieves 3.416 and 2.968 mean MOS on CSMSC and LJ Speech data sets, respectively. Besides, SiDWaveFlow converges much faster than WaveGlow at the training stage.

The non-negativity of latent variables in NAE is expected to contribute to dimensionality reduction such that the fine structure of the spectral envelopes is preserved. Experimental results demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed framework. We also study multispeaker modeling where each of NAEs corresponds to each single speaker. In addition, a neural source-filter (NSF) model was applied to the waveform generation. When a neural vocoder is trained with natural acoustic features and tested with synthesized features, quality degradation occurs due to the mismatch between training and test data. In order to mitigate the mismatch, this system uses features obtained by reconstructing natural speech using NAE for training. Experimental results show that reconstructed features are similar to synthesized features, and as a result, the quality of the synthesized speech is improved",

    "abstract": "In this work, we propose a fast and high quality neural vocoder for CPU implementation. The main approaches to realize fast inference via an autoregressive model are 1) a subband-based vocoder and 2) multiple samples prediction. Our previous work demonstrated that the combination worked well up to two samples simultaneous generation without quality degradation. To further increase the number of simultaneous samples while maintaining quality, we focus on the existence of an association between subband signals and multiple samples. Our proposed vocoder jointly models these associations with a multivariate Gaussian. Experimentals show that our proposed four-sample vocoder is 1.47 times faster than the conventional two-sample equivalent. For both the acoustic features extracted from natural speech and those predicted by TTS, the proposed method realizes generation with up to four samples without any significant degradation in naturalness. This vocoder also matched the naturalness comparable of the two-sample conventional method",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Neural vocoders have recently become popular in text-to-speech synthesis and voice conversion, increasing the demand for efficient neural vocoders. One successful approach is HiFi-GAN, which archives high-fidelity audio synthesis using a relatively small model. This characteristic is obtained using a generator incorporating multi-receptive field fusion (MRF) with multiple branches of residual blocks, allowing the expansion of the description capacity with few-channel convolutions. However, MRF requires the model size to increase with the number of branches. Alternatively, we propose a network called MISRNet, which incorporates a novel module called multi-input single shared residual block (MISR). MISR enlarges the description capacity by enriching the input variation using lightweight convolutions with a kernel size of 1 and, alternatively, reduces the variation of residual blocks from multiple to single. Because the model size of the input convolutions is significantly smaller than that of the residual blocks, MISR reduces the model size compared with that of MRF. Furthermore, we introduce an implementation technique for MISR, where we accelerate the processing speed by adopting tensor reshaping. We experimentally applied our ideas to lightweight variants of HiFi-GAN and iSTFTNet, making the models more lightweight with comparable speech quality and without compromising speed",

In this work, we propose a novel way for audio synthesis using Self-Attention Network (SAN). To the best of our knowledge, there is no successful application of Transformer architecture or SAN in high-fidelity waveform generation tasks. The main challenge in adapting SAN to audio generation tasks lies in its quadratic growth of the computational complexity with respect to the input sequence length, making it impractical with high-resolution audio tasks. To tackle this problem, we apply dilated sliding window to vanilla SAN. This technique enables our model to have large receptive field, linear computational complexity and extremely small footprint. We experimentally show that the proposed model archives smaller model size, while producing audio samples with comparable speech quality in comparison with the best publicly available model. In particular, our small footprint model has only 0.57M parameters and can generate 22.05kHz high-fidelity audio 113 times faster than real-time on a NVIDIA V100 GPU without engineered inference kernels",

To fuse an external LM using Bayes posterior theory, the log-likelihood produced by the ILM has to be accurately estimated and subtracted. In this paper we propose two novel approaches to estimate the ILM based on Listen-Attend-Spell (LAS) framework. The first method is to replace the context vector of the LAS decoder at every time step with a vector that is learned with training transcripts. Furthermore, we propose another method that uses a lightweight feed-forward network to directly map query vector to context vector in a dynamic sense. Since the context vectors are learned by minimizing the perplexities on training transcripts, and their estimation is independent of encoder output, hence the ILMs are accurately learned for both methods. Experiments show that the ILMs achieve the lowest perplexity, indicating the efficacy of the proposed methods. In addition, they also significantly outperform the shallow fusion method, as well as two previously proposed ILM Estimation (ILME) approaches on several datasets",

    "abstract": "There is often a trade-off between performance and latency in streaming automatic speech recognition (ASR). Traditional methods such as look-ahead and chunk-based methods, usually require information from future frames to advance recognition accuracy, which incurs inevitable latency even if the computation is fast enough. A causal model that computes without any future frames can avoid this latency, but its performance is significantly worse than traditional methods. In this paper, we propose corresponding revision strategies to improve the causal model. Firstly, we introduce a real-time encoder states revision strategy to modify previous states. Encoder forward computation starts once the data is received and revises the previous encoder states after several frames, which is no need to wait for any right context. Furthermore, a CTC spike position alignment decoding algorithm is designed to reduce time costs brought by the proposed revision strategy. Experiments are all conducted on Librispeech datasets. Fine-tuning on the CTC-based wav2vec2.0 model, our best method can achieve 3.7/9.2 WERs on test-clean/other sets and brings 45% relative improvement for causal models, which is also competitive with the chunk-based methods and the knowledge distillation methods",

To address this issue, this paper proposes a parameter-efficient conformer via sharing sparsely-gated experts. Specifically, we use sparsely-gated mixture-of-experts (MoE) to extend the capacity of a conformer block without increasing computation. Then, the parameters of the grouped conformer blocks are shared so that the number of parameters is reduced. Next, to ensure the shared blocks with the flexibility of adapting representations at different levels, we design the MoE routers and normalization individually. Moreover, we use knowledge distillation to further improve the performance.

However, in real applications, false alarm (FA) would be a serious problem for spotting dozens or even hundreds of keywords, which drastically affects user experience. To solve this problem, in this paper, we leverage the recent advances in transducer and transformer based acoustic models and propose a new multi-stage customized KWS framework named Cascaded Transducer-Transformer KWS~(CaTT-KWS), which includes a transducer based keyword detector, a frame-level phone predictor based force alignment module and a transformer based decoder. Specifically, the streaming transducer module is used to spot keyword candidates in audio stream. Then force alignment is implemented using the phone posteriors predicted by the phone predictor to finish the first stage keyword verification and refine the time boundaries of keyword. Finally, the transformer decoder further verifies the triggered keyword. Our proposed CaTT-KWS framework reduces FA rate effectively without obviously hurting keyword recognition accuracy. Specifically, we can get impressively 0.13 FA per hour on a challenging dataset, with over 90\\% relative reduction on FA comparing to the transducer based detection model, while keyword recognition accuracy only drops less than 2%",

Along this direction, model quantization has become an increasingly popular approach to compress neural networks and reduce computation cost. Most of the existing practical ASR systems apply post-training 8-bit quantization. To achieve a higher compression rate without introducing additional performance regression, in this study, we propose to develop 4-bit ASR models with native quantization aware training, which leverages native integer operations to effectively optimize both training and inference. We conducted two experiments on state-of-the-art Conformer-based ASR models to evaluate our proposed quantization technique. First, we explored the impact of different precisions for both weight and activation quantization on the LibriSpeech dataset, and obtained a lossless 4-bit Conformer model with 7.7x size reduction compared to the float32 model.

Knowledge Distillation (KD) is an efficient model compression method that transfers the knowledge from a large teacher model to a smaller student model. However, most of the existing KD methods study how to fully utilize the teacher's knowledge without paying attention to the student's own knowledge. In this paper, we explore whether the high-level information of the model itself is helpful for low-level information. We first propose neighboring feature self-distillation (NFSD) approach to distill the knowledge from the adjacent deeper layer to the shallow one, which shows significant performance improvement. Therefore, we further propose attention-based feature self-distillation (AFSD) approach to exploit more high-level information. Specifically, AFSD fuses the knowledge from multiple deep layers with an attention mechanism and distills it to a shallow one. The experimental results on AISHELL-1 dataset show that 7.3% and 8.3% relative character error rate (CER) reduction can be achieved from NFSD and AFSD, respectively.

Recent works have demonstrated that the performance of such direct S2ST systems is approaching that of conventional cascade S2ST when trained on comparable datasets. However, in practice, the performance of direct S2ST is bounded by the availability of paired S2ST training data. In this work, we explore multiple approaches for leveraging much more widely available unsupervised and weakly-supervised speech and text data to improve the performance of direct S2ST based on Translatotron 2. With our most effective approaches, the average translation quality of direct S2ST on 21 language pairs on the CVSS-C corpus is improved by +13.6 BLEU (or +113% relatively), as compared to the previous state-of-the-art trained without additional data. The improvements on low-resource language are even more significant (+398% relatively on average). Our comparative studies suggest future research directions for S2ST and speech representation learning",

We further investigate the inter-task interference through gradient similarity between different tasks, and improve the parameter sharing strategy in multilingual ST under the guidance of inter-task gradient similarity.

Furthermore, we design an automatic speech recognition (ASR)-based intermediate loss regularization for the streaming SLU task to improve the classification performance further. As for the simultaneous ST task, we propose a cross-lingual encoding method, which employs a CTC branch optimized with target language translations. In addition, the CTC translation output is also used to refine the search space with CTC prefix score, achieving joint CTC/attention simultaneous translation for the first time. Experiments for SLU are conducted on FSC and SLURP corpora, while the ST task is evaluated on Fisher-CallHome Spanish and MuST-C En-De corpora.

Multi-head attention in transformer basically gathers the features from individual tokens in input sequence to form the mapping to output sequence. There are twofold weaknesses in transformer. First, due to the natural property that attention mechanism would mix up the features of different tokens in input and output sequences, it is likely that the representation of input tokens contains redundant information. Second, the patterns of attention weights between different heads tend to be similar, the model capacity is bounded. To strengthen the sequential learning, this paper presents a variational disentangled mask attention in transformer where the redundant features are enhanced with semantic information. Latent disentanglement in multi-head attention is learned. The attention weights are filtered by a mask which is optimized by semantic clustering. The proposed attention mechanism is then implemented according to a Bayesian learning for clustered disentanglement.

A challenge of delivering S2ST in real time is the accumulated delay between the translation and speech synthesis modules.

In this work, we minimize the initial waiting time of iTTS by adapting the upstream speech translator to generate high-quality pseudo lookahead for the speech synthesizer. After mitigating the initial delay, we demonstrate that the duration of synthesized speech also plays a crucial role on latency.

We examine the hybrid continuity loss function using a time-domain audio-visual speaker extraction algorithm on the YouTube LRS2-BBC dataset.

However, these studies do not utilize acoustic information for punctuation prediction and are directly affected by speech recognition errors. In this study, we propose an end-to-end model that takes speech as input and outputs punctuated texts. This model is expected to predict punctuation robustly against speech recognition errors while using acoustic information.

    "abstract": "Research efforts in syntactic parsing have focused on written texts. As a result, speech parsing is usually performed on transcriptions, either in unrealistic settings (gold transcriptions) or on predicted transcriptions. Parsing speech from transcriptions, though straightforward to implement using out-of-the-box tools for Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) and dependency parsing has two important limitations. First, relying on transcriptions will lead to error propagation due to recognition mistakes. Secondly, many acoustic cues that are important for parsing (prosody, pauses, ...) are no longer available in transcriptions. To address these limitations, we introduce wav2tree, an end-to-end dependency parsing model whose only input is the raw signal. Our model builds on a pretrained wav2vec2 encoder with a CTC loss to perform ASR. We extract token segmentation from the CTC layer to construct vector representations for each predicted token. Then, we use these token representations as input to a generic parsing algorithm. The whole model is trained end-to-end with a multitask objective (ASR, parsing) to reduce error propagation. Our experiments on the Orfeo treebank of spoken French show that direct parsing from speech is feasible: wav2tree outperforms a pipeline approach based on wav2vec (for ASR) and flauBERT (for parsing)",

These disfluencies include pausing to think, hesitations, word lengthening, filled pauses and repeated phrases. This makes doing speech recognition with conversational speech, including one with multiple queries, a challenging task. To better model the conversational interaction, it is critical to discriminate disfluencies and end of query in order to allow the user to hold the floor for disfluencies while having the system respond as quickly as possible when the user has finished speaking.

The proposed approach incorporates the intended query detector into the E2E model that already folds different components of the speech recognition pipeline into one neural network. The E2E modeling on speech decoding and intended query detection also allows us to declare a quick intended query detection based on early partial recognition result, which is important to decrease latency and make the system responsive. We demonstrate that the proposed E2E approach yields a 22% relative improvement on equal error rate (EER) for the detection accuracy and 600 ms latency improvement compared with an independent intended query detector. In our experiment, the proposed model detects whether the user is talking to the device with a 8.7% EER within 1.4 seconds of median latency after user starts speaking",

We are presenting a large palette of experiments with various fine-tuning setups evaluated on two public datasets (CommonVoice and VoxPopuli) and one extremely challenging dataset from the MALACH project. Our results show that monolingual Wav2Vec 2.0 models are robust ASR systems, which can take advantage of large labeled and unlabeled datasets and successfully compete with state-of-the-art LVCSR systems. Moreover, Wav2Vec models proved to be good zero-shot learners when no training data are available for the target ASR task",

This task has received an increasing amount of attention due to its self-supervised nature (i.e., can be trained without manual labelling) combined with the ever-growing collection of audio-visual data available online. Despite these strong motivations, contemporary video-to-speech works focus mainly on small- to medium-sized corpora with substantial constraints in both vocabulary and setting. In this work, we introduce a scalable video-to-speech framework consisting of two components: a video-to-spectrogram predictor and a pre-trained neural vocoder, which converts the mel-frequency spectrograms into waveform audio. We achieve state-of-the art results for GRID and considerably outperform previous approaches on LRW. More importantly, by focusing on spectrogram prediction using a simple feedforward model, we can efficiently and effectively scale our method to very large and unconstrained datasets: To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to show intelligible results on the challenging LRS3 dataset",

Tokyo and Kinki Japanese are two dialects in Japan with the same phonotactics, but Tokyo and Kinki Japanese regard LLH (low low high) and LHH as illegal tonal patterns, respectively. We controlled an index representing linguistic exposure to the Tokyo pitch pattern and used an AXB discrimination task to investigate whether the pitch patterns influence the perception. We found that Tokyo dialect listeners with the high index, who have long exposure to the Tokyo pitch pattern, perceived \"H\" pitch between L and H, whereas the subjects with the low index did not show any preference. These results indicated that pitch patterns were also used in the perception of illusory pitches and were reproduced in a simulation study",

The procedure is used to derive the first corpus of Spanish-accented English composed of lexical tokens each generated with one of five degrees of non-native accent. As an example application, corpus tokens are used to elicit accentedness judgements from four listener cohorts with first languages which differ as to whether they share the native language, the non-native (accented) language of the corpus or have a closer phonological inventory to one or the other.

    "abstract": "This study aims to identify laryngeal manipulations that would allow a male to approximate a female-sounding voice, and that can be targeted in voice feminization surgery or therapy. Synthetic voices were generated using a three-dimensional vocal fold model with parametric variations in vocal fold geometry, stiffness, adduction, and subglottal pressure. The vocal tract was kept constant in order to focus on the contribution of laryngeal manipulations. Listening subjects were asked to judge if a voice sounded male or female, or if they were unsure. Results showed the expected large effect of the fundamental frequency (F0) and a moderate effect of spectral shape on gender perception. A mismatch between F0 and spectral shape cues (e.g., low F0 paired with high H1-H2) contributed to ambiguity in gender perception, particularly for voices with F0 in the intermediate range between those of typical adult males and females. Physiologically, the results showed that a female-sounding voice can be produced by decreasing vocal fold thickness and increasing vocal fold transverse stiffness in the coronal plane, changes in which modified both F0 and spectral shape. In contrast, laryngeal manipulations with limited impact on F0 or spectral shape were shown to be less effective in modifying gender perception",

    "abstract": "This study investigates how French learners, whose native language has only a binary laryngeal contrast, acquire the Korean three-way laryngeal contrast in stops by focusing on cue weighting. We tested how 21 French learners of Korean identify fortis/lenis/aspirated Korean stops over eight monthly sessions. Learners were the most successful at identifying aspirated stops. The identification of lenis stops was the most challenging, with no improvement over the 8 months, whereas the perception of aspirated and fortis stops improved. In order to explain the difficulty with lenis stops, we tested the relative contribution of VOT and f0 to the perception of the contrast on synthesized stimuli. Learners showed different cue-weighting strategies: VOT was used to distinguish between aspirated and fortis/lenis, and f0 was used to differentiate between fortis and lenis, implying a two-way rather than a three-way contrast. Furthermore, the larger weight given to VOT compared to f0 by the French learners can explain the poor identification of lenis stops, whose main contrastive cue in Korean is a lowering of f0 on the following vowel. Based on these findings, the acquisition of the three-way contrast necessitates a reorganization of the cues' relative weight",

    "abstract": "Models of acoustic word embeddings (AWEs) learn to map variable-length spoken word segments onto fixed-dimensionality vector representations such that different acoustic exemplars of the same word are projected nearby in the embedding space. In addition to their speech technology applications, AWE models have been shown to predict human performance on a variety of auditory lexical processing tasks. Current AWE models are based on neural networks and trained in a bottom-up approach that integrates acoustic cues to build up a word representation given an acoustic or symbolic supervision signal. Therefore, these models do not leverage or capture high-level lexical knowledge during the learning process. In this paper, we propose a multi-task learning model that incorporates top-down lexical knowledge into the training procedure of AWEs. Our model learns a mapping between the acoustic input and a lexical representation that encodes high-level information such as word semantics in addition to bottom-up form-based supervision.

We design two personalized KWS tasks; (1) Target user Biased KWS (TB-KWS) and (2) Target user Only KWS (TO-KWS). To solve the tasks, we propose personalized keyword spotting through multi-task learning (PK-MTL) that consists of multi-task learning and task-adaptation. First, we introduce applying multi-task learning on keyword spotting and speaker verification to leverage user information to the keyword spotting system. Next, we design task-specific scoring functions to adapt to the personalized KWS tasks thoroughly.

    "abstract": "In recent years, the standard hybrid DNN-HMM speech recognizers are outperformed by the end-to-end speech recognition systems. One of the very promising approaches is the grapheme Wav2Vec 2.0 model, which uses the self-supervised pretraining approach combined with transfer learning of the fine-tuned speech recognizer. Since it lacks the pronunciation vocabulary and language model, the approach is suitable for tasks where obtaining such models is not easy or almost impossible. In this paper, we use the Wav2Vec speech recognizer in the task of spoken term detection over a large set of spoken documents. The method employs a deep LSTM network which maps the recognized hypothesis and the searched term into a shared pronunciation embedding space in which the term occurrences and the assigned scores are easily computed. The paper describes a bootstrapping approach that allows the transfer of the knowledge contained in traditional pronunciation vocabulary of DNN-HMM hybrid ASR into the context of grapheme-based Wav2Vec.

Through a single, tunable hyperparameter, our approach enables one to balance detection latency and accuracy for the targeted application. Empirically, we show that our approach gives superior performance under latency constraints when compared to existing methods. Namely, we make a substantial 25 % relative false accepts improvement for a fixed latency target when compared to the baseline state-of-the-art.

A detector is typically trained on speech data independent of speaker information and used for the voice trigger detection task. However, such a speaker independent voice trigger detector typically suffers from performance degradation on speech from underrepresented groups, such as accented speakers. In this work, we propose a novel voice trigger detector that can use a small number of utterances from a target speaker to improve detection accuracy. Our proposed model employs an encoder-decoder architecture. While the encoder performs speaker independent voice trigger detection, similar to the conventional detector, the decoder is trained with metric learning and predicts a personalized embedding for each utterance. A personalized voice trigger score is then obtained as a similarity score between the embeddings of enrollment utterances and a test utterance. The personalized embedding allows adapting to target speaker's speech when computing the voice trigger score, hence improving voice trigger detection accuracy.

We address this problem by proposing a new model for NER task -- an RNN transducer, which has hitherto been used only in speech recognition. These models are trained using paired input and output sequences without explicitly specifying the alignment between them, similar to other seq-to-seq models. In NER tasks, however, the alignment between words and labels are available from the human annotations. We propose a fixed alignment model that utilizes the given alignment, while preserving the benefits of RNN-Ts such as modeling output dependencies. We also propose a constrained alignment model where users can specify a relaxation and the model will learn an alignment within the given constraints. In other words, we propose a family of seq-to-seq models which can leverage alignments between input and target sequences when available. Through empirical experiments on a challenging real-world medical NER task with multiple ontologies, we demonstrate that our fixed alignment model outperforms the standard RNN-T model",

This richness makes speech a powerful signal in relation to a range of different health conditions, including major depressive disorders (MDD). One pivotal issue in speech-depression research is the assumption that depressive severity is the dominant measurable effect. However, given the heterogeneous clinical profile of MDD, it may actually be the case that speech alterations are more strongly associated with subsets of key depression symptoms. This paper presents strong evidence in support of this argument. First, we present a novel large, cross-sectional, multi-modal dataset collected at Thymia. We then present a set of machine learning experiments that demonstrate that combining speech with features from an n-Back working memory assessment improves classifier performance when predicting the popular eight-item Patient Health Questionnaire depression scale (PHQ-8). Finally, we present a set of experiments that highlight the association between different speech and n-Back markers at the PHQ-8 item level. Specifically, we observe that somatic and psychomotor symptoms are more strongly associated with n-Back performance scores, whilst the other items: anhedonia, depressed mood, change in appetite, feelings of worthlessness and trouble concentrating are more strongly associated with speech changes",

Rather than using the hard mask as in previous works, our experiments show that learning a soft-weighting function for the candidate phonemes benefits performance. In addition, our proposed g2pW does not require extra pre-trained POS tagging models while using POS tags as auxiliary features since we train the POS tagging model simultaneously with the unified encoder.

    "title": "A Unified Accent Estimation Method Based on Multi-Task Learning for Japanese Text-to-Speech",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "We propose a unified accent estimation method for Japanese text-to-speech (TTS). Unlike the conventional two-stage methods, which separately train two models for predicting accent phrase boundaries and accent nucleus positions, our method merges the two models and jointly optimizes the entire model in a multi-task learning framework. Furthermore, considering the hierarchical linguistic structure of intonation phrases (IPs), accent phrases, and accent nuclei, we generalize the proposed approach to simultaneously model the IP boundaries with accent information. Objective evaluation results reveal that the proposed method achieves an accent estimation accuracy of 80.4%, which is 6.67% higher than the conventional two-stage method. When the proposed method is incorporated into a neural TTS framework, the system achieves a 4.29 mean opinion score with respect to prosody naturalness",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "We present a neural text-to-speech (TTS) method that models natural vocal effort variation to improve the intelligibility of synthetic speech in the presence of noise. The method consists of first measuring the spectral tilt of unlabeled conventional speech data, and then conditioning a neural TTS model with normalized spectral tilt among other prosodic factors. Changing the spectral tilt parameter and keeping other prosodic factors unchanged enables effective vocal effort control at synthesis time independent of other prosodic factors. By extrapolation of the spectral tilt values beyond what has been seen in the original data, we can generate speech with high vocal effort levels, thus improving the intelligibility of speech in the presence of masking noise. We evaluate the intelligibility and quality of normal speech and speech with increased vocal effort in the presence of various masking noise conditions, and compare these to well-known speech intelligibility-enhancing algorithms. The evaluations show that the proposed method can improve the intelligibility of synthetic speech with little loss in speech quality",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Recent advances in synthetic speech quality have enabled us to train text-to-speech (TTS) systems by using synthetic corpora. However, merely increasing the amount of synthetic data is not always advantageous for improving training efficiency. Our aim in this study is to selectively choose synthetic data that are beneficial to the training process. In the proposed method, we first adopt a variational autoencoder whose posterior distribution is utilized to extract latent features representing acoustic similarity between the recorded and synthetic corpora. By using those learned features, we then train a ranking support vector machine (RankSVM) that is well known for effectively ranking relative attributes among binary classes. By setting the recorded and synthetic ones as two opposite classes, RankSVM is used to determine how the synthesized speech is acoustically similar to the recorded data. Then, synthetic TTS data, whose distribution is close to the recorded data, are selected from large-scale synthetic corpora. By using these data for retraining the TTS model, the synthetic quality can be significantly improved. Objective and subjective evaluation results show the superiority of the proposed method over the conventional methods",

To overcome these issues, we demonstrate how to build low-resource, neural text-to-speech (TTS) voices with only 1 hour of conversational speech, when no other conversational data are available in the same language. Assuming the availability of non-expressive speech data in that language, we propose a 3-step technology: 1) we train an F0-conditioned voice conversion (VC) model as data augmentation technique; 2) we train an F0 predictor to control the conversational flavour of the voice-converted synthetic data; 3) we train a TTS system that consumes the augmented data.

    "abstract": "Contact center conversations often contain segments with hold music, automatic-recorded-messages or pure silences, where neither the customer nor the agent is speaking. We refer to these segments as Conversational Silences [1]. These silences when continued beyond an acceptable level can negatively impact im portant contact center KPIs, like average handling time, agent efficiency, etc. and may lead to poor customer experience. As a result, it becomes imperative for contact centers to identify si lences in conversations and define mechanisms to better handle them. In this paper, we propose a cascaded system consisting of an ASR engine, a silence detector block, a text classification layer and a heuristic engine to surface instances in calls where agents are missing the protocols to handle silences. This system is used to trigger alerts to agents in real time thus enabling them to course correct while being on call with the customer. More over, these instances can also be surfaced to their supervisors so as to identify agents who are frequently missing these protocols and thereby design dedicated coaching sessions",

Analyzing cry enables not only the identification of babies' needs/thoughts they want to express, but also the prediction of potential diseases. In general, it is much more difficult to recognize special needs and emotions from infant cry than adults, because infant cry does not contain any linguistic information and the emotional expression is not as rich as adults.In this work, we focus on the time-frequency characteristics of infant crying signals and propose a differential time-frequency log-Mel spectrogram features based vision transformer (ViT) approach for infant cry recognition (ICR). We first calculate the deltas of log-Mel spectrogram of infant crying sounds over time frames and frequencies, respectively. The log-Mels and deltas are then combined as a 3-D feature representation and fed into the ViT model for cry classification. Experimental results on the CRIED database show the superiority of the proposed system over comparison methods and that the combination of logMels, the time-frame delta and frequency-bin delta achieves the best performance.

We utilize the concept of Myers-Briggs personality type indicators in order to adapt chatbot behavior. In a user study, we investigate the impact and realization of the so-called ``law of attraction'' by providing users with a chatbot that mirrors their own personality. This entails predicting the personality from the user behavior, in this work chat messages, by utilizing a pre-trained language model rather than composing many resources like lexicons. We conduct a user study with aligned and misaligned personality and analyze the effect on usability. Results show that alignment significantly improves major usability factors such as satisfaction, perceived naturalness, recommendation likelihood, appropriateness and trustworthiness of our interaction. Further, comparing different language models, contrastive learning approaches outperform previous methods. Predicting the thinking vs. feeling and introversion vs. extroversion indicator dichotomies, we achieve 76.14% f1 and 69.11 f1, respectively, with setting a new state-of-the-art performance in the literature for the former.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "For multimodal sentiment analysis (MSA), the text-centric approach has been shown to be superior in performance, which adopts powerful text models (e.g., BERT) as backbone and studies how to effectively incorporate non-verbal modalities (i.e., audio and visual) to obtain more refined and expressive word representations. In previous methods, the non-verbal information injected into a word representation only comes from a non-verbal segment corresponding to the time span of the word, ignoring the long-range dependencies across modalities. Meanwhile, these methods utilize the Softmax normalization function-based attention mechanism, which makes it difficult to highlight the important information in non-verbal sequences. To this end, this paper proposes a non-verbal information injection method called Word-wise Sparse Attention (WSA) to capture the cross-modal long-range dependencies. When injecting the non-verbal information into a word, the word is used as the semantic anchor to search for the most relevant non-verbal information from holistic non-verbal sequences. Furthermore, an advanced Multimodal Adaptive Gating (MAG) mechanism is introduced to determine the amount of information injected from non-verbal modalities. We evaluate our method on the two publicly available multimodal sentiment datasets. Experimental results show that the proposed approach improves the baseline model consistently on all metrics",

We perform our experiments on the TIMIT dataset and significantly outperform the current state-of-the-art results on age estimation. Specifically, we achieve root mean squared error (RMSE) of 5.54 years and 6.49 years for male and female age estimation, respectively.

    "abstract": "Speech emotion recognition has made significant progress in recent years, in which feature representation learning has been paid more attention, but discriminative emotional features extraction has remained unresolved. In this paper, we propose MDSCM - a Multi-attention based Depthwise Separable Convolutional Model for speech emotional feature extraction that can reduce the feature redundancy through separating spatial-wise convolution and channel-wise convolution. MDSCM also enhances the feature discriminability by the multi-attention module that focuses on learning features with more emotional information. In addition, we propose an Audio-Visual Domain Adaptation Learning paradigm (AVDAL) to learn an audio-visual emotion-identity space. A shared audio-visual representation encoder is built to transfer the emotional knowledge learned from the visual domain to complement and enhance the emotional features that only extracted from speech. Domain classifier and emotion classifier are used for encoder training to reduce the mismatching of domain features, and enhance the discriminability of features for emotion recognition. The experimental results on the IEMOCAP dataset demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms other state-of-the-art speech emotion recognition systems, achieving 72.43% on weighted accuracy and 73.22% on unweighted accuracy.

Results showed that the emotion identification accuracy was significantly lower in noisy conditions than in noiseless ones, whether additional visual information was presented simultaneously or not. In noisy environments, providing multisensory emotional information greatly facilitated recognition performances even when the visual information was less reliable.

    "abstract": "In conversation-based psychotherapy, therapists use verbal techniques to help clients express thoughts and feelings, and change behavior. In particular, how well therapists convey empathy is an essential quality index of psychotherapy sessions and is associated with psychotherapy outcome. In this paper, we analyze the prosody of therapist speech and attempt to associate the therapist's speaking style with subjectively perceived empathy. An automatic speech and text processing system is developed to segment long recordings of psychotherapy sessions into pause-delimited utterances with text transcriptions. Data-driven clustering is applied to the utterances from different therapists in multiple sessions. For each cluster, a typological representation of utterance genre is derived based on quantized prosodic feature parameters. Prominent speaking styles of the therapist can be observed and interpreted from salient utterance genres that are correlated with empathy. Using the salient utterance genres, an accuracy of 71% is achieved in classifying psychotherapy sessions into \"high\" and \"low\" empathy level. Analysis of results suggests that empathy level tends to be (1) low if therapists speak long utterances slowly or speak short utterances quickly; and (2) high if therapists talk to clients with a steady tone and volume",

It is found that the speech from both the therapist and the client are contributing to predicting the empathy level that is subjectively rated by an expert observer. By analyzing speaker turns assigned with high attention weights, it is observed that 2 to 6 consecutive turns should be considered together to provide useful clues for detecting empathy, and the observer tends to take the whole session into consideration when rating the therapist empathy, instead of relying on a few specific speaker turns",

Recent works have witnessed the benefits of upstream pretrained models in both audio and textual modalities for the AER task.

In this work, we first validate the effectiveness of the upstream models in a unimodal setup and empirically find that partial fine-tuning of the pretrained model in the feature space can significantly boost performance. Moreover, we take the context of the current sentence to model a more accurate emotional state. Based on the unimodal setups, we further propose several multimodal fusion methods to combine high-level features from the audio and text modalities.

    "title": "Unsupervised Instance Discriminative Learning for Depression Detection from Speech Signals",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) is a severe illness that affects millions of people, and it is critical to diagnose this disorder as early as possible. Detecting depression from voice signals can be of great help to physicians and can be done without the need of any invasive procedure. Since relevant labelled data are scarce, we propose a modified Instance Discriminative Learning (IDL) method, an unsupervised pre-training technique, to extract augment-invariant and instance-spread-out embeddings. In terms of learning augment-invariant embeddings, various data augmentation methods for speech are investigated, and time-masking is found to provide the best performance. To learn instance-spread-out embeddings, we explore methods for sampling instances for a training batch (distinct speaker-based and random sampling). It is found that the distinct speaker-based sampling provides better performance than the random one, and we hypothesize that this result is because relevant speaker information is preserved in the embedding. Additionally, we propose a novel sampling strategy, Pseudo Instance-based Sampling (PIS), based on clustering algorithms, to enhance spread-out characteristics of the embeddings. Experiments are conducted with DepAudioNet on DAIC-WOZ (English) and CONVERGE (Mandarin) datasets, and statistically significant improvements are observed in the detection of MDD relative to the baseline with no pre-training",

    "title": "How do our eyebrows respond to masks and whispering? The case of Persians",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Whispering is one of the mechanisms of human communication to convey linguistic information. Due to the lack of vocal fold vibration, whispering acoustically differs from the voiced speech in the absence of fundamental frequency which is one of the main prosodic correlates of intonation. This study addresses the importance of facial cues with respect to acoustic cues of intonation. Specifically, we aim to probe how eyebrow velocity and furrowing change when people whisper and wear face masks, also, when they are supposed to produce a prosodic modulation as it is the case in polar questions with rising intonation. To this end, we run an experiment with 10 Persian speakers. The results show the greater mean speed when speakers whisper indicating a compensation effect for the lack of F0 in whispering. We also found a more pronounced movement of both eyebrows when the speakers wear a mask. Finally, our results reveal greater eyebrow motions in questions suggesting the question is a more marked utterance type than a statement. No significant effect of eyebrow furrowing was found. However, eyebrow movements were positively correlated with the eyebrow widening suggesting a mutual link between these two movement types",

    "title": "State & Trait Measurement from Nonverbal Vocalizations: A Multi-Task Joint Learning Approach",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Humans infer a wide array of meanings from expressive nonverbal vocalizations, \\eg laughs, cries, and sighs. Thus far, computational research has primarily focused on the coarse classification of vocalizations such as laughs, but that approach overlooks significant variations in the meaning of distinct laughs (e.g., amusement, awkwardness, triumph) and the rich array of more nuanced vocalizations people form. Nonverbal vocalizations are shaped by the emotional state an individual chooses to convey, their wellbeing, and (as with the voice more broadly) their identity-related traits. In the present study, we utilize a large-scale dataset comprising more than 35 hours of densely labeled vocal bursts to model emotionally expressive states and demographic traits from nonverbal vocalizations. We compare a single-task and multi-task deep learning architecture to explore how models can leverage acoustic co-dependencies that may exist between the expression of 10 emotions by vocal bursts and the demographic traits of the speaker. Results show that nonverbal vocalizations can be reliably leveraged to predict emotional expression, age, and country of origin. In a multi-task setting, our experiments show that joint learning of emotional expression and demographic traits appears to yield robust results, primarily beneficial for the classification of a speaker's country of origin",

    "title": "Confidence Measure for Automatic Age Estimation From Speech",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Age estimation from speech is a problem that has wide applications in call centers, virtual assistants and IoT devices. The estimated age is used for various system decisions related to personalization, parental control, and anomaly detection. Performance of speech based automatic age estimation systems is generally stated in the literature using the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Pearson Correlation Coefficient (PC). In real-world applications of these systems, MAE and PC provide little insight into the confidence of a point estimate. An MAE of 5 years on a test set provides only the average error across all estimates in the test set and hence does not provide any information about the confidence of each individual estimate. A confidence score of predicted age is essential to know the trustworthiness of the predictions made by the system. This paper formulates age estimation from speech as a label distribution learning problem to come up with a measure of the confidence related to the point estimate being within a desired range from the ground-truth. It further uses it to analyze the age estimation system under conditions of varying speech quality. We show that the proposed measure of confidence is better than a fixed error-margin",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "We report on aggressive quantization strategies that greatly accelerate inference of Recurrent Neural Network Transducers (RNN-T). We use a 4 bit integer representation for both weights and activations and apply Quantization Aware Training (QAT) to retrain the full model (acoustic encoder and language model) and achieve near-iso-accuracy. We show that customized quantization schemes that are tailored to the local properties of the network are essential to achieve good performance while limiting the computational overhead of QAT. Density ratio Language Model fusion has shown remarkable accuracy gains on RNN-T workloads but it severely increases the computational cost of inference. We show that our quantization strategies enable using large beam widths for hypothesis search while achieving streaming-compatible runtimes and a full model compression ratio of 7.6x compared to the full precision model. Via hardware simulations, we estimate a 3.4x acceleration from FP16 to INT4 for the end-to-end quantized RNN-T inclusive of LM fusion, resulting in a Real Time Factor (RTF) of 0.06. On the NIST Hub5 2000, Hub5 2001, and RT-03 test sets, we retain most of the gains associated with LM fusion, improving the average WER by >1.5%",
